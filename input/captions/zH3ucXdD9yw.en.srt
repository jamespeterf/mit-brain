1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,799
and I'm I'm thrilled to be here with a

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,319
fantastic panel where we're going to

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,280
continue the

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,440
conversation of a lot of the topics that

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,799
Ben and Liz put on the table and we're

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,039
going to unpack them so first let's just

7
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:19,640
introduce the panel real quick so you

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,640
heard from Ben and Liz and I'm going to

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,800
ask them to say just you know one thing

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,320
about themselves but first let's start

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,880
with Cyrus here introduce yourself and

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
tell us a little bit about you sure sure

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,399
morning everybody my name is Shaul I'm

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,520
one of the co-founders and the CEO of

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:40,600
Leela AI uh Leela AI is an MIT spin-off

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,079
startup we've been in operation uh since

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,800
2019 and we've been selling our solution

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,280
to large Enterprises since 2021 and

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,960
we're also part of the MIT ILP startup

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,680
Exchange program which is uh the sex 25

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,359
it's 25 uh industry ready startups

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,039
that's part of the MIT ecosystem so

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,480
we've been very deeply connected with

24
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,719
the MIT ecosystem from the beginning

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,080
um and uh what we do is we have built a

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,439
new kind of visual system an AI system

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,200
that doesn't use uh directly gen systems

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,799
because uh as we saw you know gen

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
systems can make weird mistakes like how

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,560
many letters RS are there in the word

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,560
strawberry um when you're in industrial

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,880
manufacturing operations contexts you

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
can't have things make mistakes 20% or

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,200
30% of the time that just does not work

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,600
so we had to build an ultra reliable

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
robust Ma Machine Vision system to

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,079
understand visually what's going on

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,439
operations particularly we focus on

39
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,600
manual operations places where there's

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,159
been uh very little data and so uh we've

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,840
been able to shine a light and open up

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,479
and create data coming out of parts of

43
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,000
manufacturing and Industrial operations

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,520
where there was no data and uh it's been

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,360
very very interesting over the last few

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,880
years I've learned a lot and I love

47
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,240
working with manufacturers and other

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
industrial Partners I hope we can learn

49
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,680
find a way to work with some of you

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,240
today uh so thank you very much awesome

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,079
Cyrus thank you Aurora over to you yes

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,920
thank you good morning everybody good

53
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,399
morning everybody my name is Aurora

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,800
Kennedy and I work for SLB previously

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,319
known as Slumber

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,879
J and uh so I've been with the company

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,319
for 19 years my background is electrical

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,280
engineering well in my different roles

59
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,560
I've had roles in supply chain new

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,920
product development manufacturing and

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,160
what brings me here today with the

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,760
future of work is exciting topic is

63
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,480
because in my current role for the

64
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,360
technology organization within SLB which

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,680
is over

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,800
23,000 uh employees for the technology

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,800
only I look after the recruiting so that

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,920
is our new talent coming in as well as

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,239
the Learning and Development of our

70
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,760
population and that makes it very

71
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,159
exciting for me to be a part of this

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,200
conversation both because I have

73
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,840
experienced different layers of work and

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,319
because I'm looking out for what our

75
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,159
future Talent will need in terms of

76
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,280
developing and uh delivering the new

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,640
technology for tomorrow so I'm excited

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,920
to be a part of this discussion super

79
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,799
Aurora thank you now Ben next up to you

80
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,760
we we already got an introduction to you

81
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,480
but just sort of maybe a comment or

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
another point that you want to add here

83
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,840
at the

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,799
beginning sure in a conversation about

85
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,440
work I think uh just to give some

86
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,799
context on my own work I didn't go

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,319
straight from college to Academia I went

88
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,280
and worked in Silicon Valley and uh a

89
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,159
lot of my work that I shared today about

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
manufacturing was motivated by a

91
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,439
particular experience in Silicon Valley

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,200
which was that people were very good at

93
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,959
inventing new products you could get a

94
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,120
lot of people who who design them and I

95
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,720
worked U was leading a a small team that

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,159
was developing a remote sensing device

97
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,840
so essentially a really cheap cell phone

98
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,560
that could measure water and power um

99
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,760
use and we were trying to prototype it

100
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,360
in the US around California and I

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
remember just riding my bike to

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,000
different you know like little shops and

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,360
trying to put together this prototype

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,640
and then I I was talking to people and

105
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,680
they're like why are you trying to do

106
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,840
this just call these fixers in China we

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
can't do this anymore in the US and it

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
was it was pretty shocking that a lot of

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,840
these inventions that were coming out of

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,640
this very small area that I was excited

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
about motivated by they didn't really

112
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,840
have the capability to see those

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000
inventions into reality even in a small

114
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,799
volume and that struck me as a really

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,880
big problem that no one was really

116
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,759
talking about as a problem um and that's

117
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,440
one of the reasons why I'm excited to do

118
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
what I do today and excited by the work

119
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,800
that Liz does as well that's so

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,280
interesting did I hear that right that

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,880
in between high school and college you

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,240
went to siloc and Valley for a job or

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
was it in between grad no College uh

124
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,479
college was after college yeah after

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,919
college he was bright but not that I

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,720
wish he were I wish you were high school

127
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,400
that would be that would be

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,800
nice that's really cool Liz quick story

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,919
uh okay well if we're going if we're

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,120
going to look backwards a little bit um

131
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,160
I will just share that I am from

132
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,680
Manchester New Hampshire which if uh

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,880
anybody knows their uh textile mill

134
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,360
history was was the largest textile

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,880
mills at about the early part of the

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,680
1900s and um employed uh close to

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:15,000
177,000 workers and of course um like

138
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,360
the Mills around the country uh the the

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,240
Manchester Mills amamos Mills along the

140
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,880
river went into decline uh and starting

141
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,560
essentially in the 30s and 40s uh and

142
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,120
then we're shuddering when I was growing

143
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,479
up there uh my my uh shoes were no

144
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,240
longer made in New England they were

145
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:35,160
made in China but the exciting part of

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
the story that I feel is uh you know

147
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,639
represents where we are where I

148
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,080
personally am and where I think the

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,400
country is is we've seen these Mills

150
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,639
come back and the arguably the center

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,919
for um in Innovation and Manufacturing

152
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,280
in regenerative medicine is now in the

153
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,000
amamos Mills um in in Manchester New

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,639
Hampshire and uh and one of our centers

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,759
uh is there and I see that as sort of a

156
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,400
a a foreshadowing of what we can imagine

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,840
in the country again with technology

158
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,800
where we are leading the way as a

159
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,680
country and and hopefully not just um

160
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
reshoring which I there's a lot of hype

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,319
around reshoring and and it is real but

162
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,880
it is not going to turn around this

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,080
country it's really in the investing in

164
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,360
the new Industries and the growing areas

165
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,400
where we have competitive Advantage

166
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,919
awesome okay so I'm going to bring this

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,080
back to then Aurora and and Cyrus who I

168
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,000
want to I want them to comment on sort

169
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,800
of Workforce bits I want to ask the AV

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,440
guys back there if you could set my

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,240
clock here to 40 minutes and then start

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,520
it that will help us sort of just be

173
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,720
able to Pace ourselves all right now

174
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,199
Aurora so I I think that we got some

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,919
sort of opening comments on the table

176
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,240
around sort of what are the most

177
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,960
important issues around Workforce being

178
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,039
at SB for 19 years which a I think that

179
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,240
is so impressive and in in different

180
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,960
these days

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,800
talk to us about some of a key thing

182
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,080
that you think sort of driving Workforce

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
change now so I think one of the big

184
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,319
things driving Workforce change

185
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,240
especially what I see in SLV we have a a

186
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:17,759
continued learning but one of the things

187
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,120
that we see is uh adoption is a big um a

188
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,560
hurdle right so we heard from from Liz

189
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,120
and we heard from Ben about how some

190
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,240
people are resistance to the change so

191
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
really it's a it's a human factor to be

192
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
resistant to change to be be afraid of

193
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,160
things that are different and I think

194
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,879
one of the things that we do at SLB is

195
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,120
we try to make sure that we get

196
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,280
comfortable with the uncomfortable we

197
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,080
have uh been we we call it living our

198
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,599
culture and exploring our behaviors one

199
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,759
of our behaviors is we experiment learn

200
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,080
and grow and I think having that

201
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
vocabulary spread across the

202
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
organization gives us a little bit of

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,560
permission to say hey look we're going

204
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,800
to try things out we're going to see how

205
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,039
they work we don't take unnecessary risk

206
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,919
or changes but we are open to the

207
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,879
possibility and I think that's one of

208
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,680
the things that I like about being here

209
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,919
is seeing the different ways that our

210
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,120
Workforce can change not only in our

211
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:13,039
skills but in the way we take in what's

212
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,840
new specifically we also have strategic

213
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,360
targets for upskilling so we started

214
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,000
doing this way back but more focused in

215
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,560
2022 with employee any employee can pick

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,599
on three scales and these are part of

217
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,120
the objectives which is either

218
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:32,839
sustainability on um digit

219
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,919
or it could be on the production itself

220
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,479
so we keep that fostering the

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,959
growth awesome okay so that's a really

222
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,000
interesting model within a large

223
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,200
organization Cyrus as as someone

224
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
founding and running a startup how do

225
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,000
you think about

226
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,399
Workforce yeah it's interesting how

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,040
different it is sometimes from big uh

228
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,920
multinational corporations and small

229
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,640
startups uh we we have to be very um

230
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,160
flexible and everybody has to be

231
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,600
multi-roll in in in a startup and I see

232
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,720
that now also happening a little bit in

233
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,560
our customers as well which are giant

234
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,160
customers uh you know hundreds of

235
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,480
thousands of employees but they're also

236
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,480
embracing this idea of uh having people

237
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,440
have many different roles at the same

238
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,680
time maybe maybe two or three we we we

239
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,399
have like 10 because we're tiny but I

240
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,480
think that's a big Trend that I'm

241
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,640
noticing uh that's it's sort of the

242
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,000
startup psychology leaking into

243
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:37,519
Enterprise uh a little bit yeah yeah oh

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,440
no that's interesting um okay so now Liz

245
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,560
I want to bring it over to you and talk

246
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,000
about reskilling and continuous

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,160
education you brought that up a bit um

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,480
in your talk earlier but thinking

249
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:57,079
about um Workforce transformation and

250
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,560
how do we scale efforts around that some

251
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,959
of the insights you got from work of the

252
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,200
future

253
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,680
uh well as as I said before we had a um

254
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
multi-year effort with work of the

255
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,560
future task force um and we had a whole

256
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,240
range of um MIT expertise brought to the

257
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,360
table uh and one of the realities that

258
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,320
we you know were confronting back then

259
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,800
and today as has been outlined is this

260
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,200
issue of the long-term trends on um work

261
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,880
on the on the workforce population and

262
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,360
the Aging aging Workforce lower

263
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,560
fertility rates uh some constrictions on

264
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,440
on immigration all of those factors

265
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,839
coming into play as we look ahead at our

266
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,279
Workforce and so the idea that workers

267
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,560
uh were you know are dispensable just

268
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,160
has is out the window right everybody's

269
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,360
trying to retain their workers um and

270
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,240
increase productivity and so what that

271
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,519
means is you have to upskill you have to

272
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,279
think about how you're going to get more

273
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,399
you know more time and and retain uh

274
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,480
retain the workers you have let alone

275
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,399
attract the next gener ation so what

276
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,320
work like Ben's work and others have

277
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,800
shown as I said earlier is that by

278
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,160
investing in the workers and I think

279
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,160
creating us a level of trust about ad

280
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,240
technology adoption there's a path

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,760
forward for upskilling and when

282
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,760
companies are investing in new

283
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,839
technology they invest in the training

284
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,839
of their Workforce so I think the the

285
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,279
the the question has been well what does

286
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,839
this mean for in the operation space you

287
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,600
know the digital

288
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,480
uh transformation and and how accessible

289
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,279
is that for you know existing the

290
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,560
existing Workforce relative to the force

291
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,200
and what what we found in our research

292
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,079
for production in The Innovation economy

293
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,600
is we would go out and talk to the large

294
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,240
firms and say well what do you want in

295
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,519
your Workforce and they'd say well we

296
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,959
want the grounded technical skills of

297
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:58,320
the older workers combined with the

298
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,800
Savvy with new technology and you know

299
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,000
interfaces that are of the younger

300
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,920
worker so how do we create that pathway

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,200
forward and of course that is a a

302
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,600
challenging pathway but it it shows the

303
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,279
value of that whole spectrum of workers

304
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
that we need the you know we need the

305
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,839
grounded skills uh of what the older

306
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,720
workers have seen and understand in

307
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,079
terms of operations combined with the

308
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,440
newer skills the digital skills I think

309
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,199
what's happening with technology uh

310
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,040
right now is that the digital technology

311
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,920
is meeting the worker where they are

312
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,560
yeah right that is we're not asking

313
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,800
workers necessarily to learn skills that

314
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,320
they can't obtain or that require you

315
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,000
know very uh significant long-term

316
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,360
investment we're trying to bring a lot

317
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,120
of this new technology is and Cyrus can

318
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,920
talk about this is is bringing sort of

319
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,720
democratizing the technology and

320
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,480
allowing workers to have access to it

321
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,920
and then actually use it as a tool

322
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,399
because as soon as they feel like

323
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,320
they're problem solving that they're

324
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,480
part of the the answer uh that

325
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,800
technology then becomes empowering for

326
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,560
them so I see that pathway forward right

327
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,639
now uh and the question is the adoption

328
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,399
which I I know others we were talking

329
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,800
about in in the break and and Ben Ben

330
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,480
had comments as well Ben may want to

331
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,360
follow up on that absolutely and I think

332
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,160
Aurora put that adoption on the table

333
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,680
Ben you had some great studies about

334
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,360
this pick up the ball um so adoption of

335
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,279
new technologies across Industries

336
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,839
actually is there's a a long tale of

337
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,600
small companies in particular that are

338
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,360
very slow to adopt new technologies and

339
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,120
take risk on investing in Technologies

340
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,440
particularly those without a clear

341
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,440
return so you'll have some some leaders

342
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,160
a small group of maybe you know 5% of

343
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,480
overall companies that are early to

344
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,519
adopt new technologies and then a l a

345
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,279
large group of uh smaller comp a large

346
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,839
group of companies smaller in size that

347
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,320
are followers and I think that the key

348
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,399
to driving up adoption in the sense that

349
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,639
we want adoption because adoption not

350
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,560
only can improve productivity but it

351
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,120
also is associated with higher wage jobs

352
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,600
in a lot of cases um is to help these

353
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,480
companies take uh either prove to them

354
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,639
that there is a clear Roi associated

355
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,000
with the technology or to drisk the

356
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,480
decision to adopt a new technology so I

357
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,800
think one um industry that has uh been

358
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,600
uh you know a good case for this is

359
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,240
additive manufacturing where a lot of

360
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,639
Manufacturers have been uh able to

361
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,480
experiment with additive by uh having a

362
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,360
low cost 3D printer where they can

363
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,240
prototype some parts or at least get

364
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,600
accustomed to what part production with

365
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,920
additive looks like now the scale up of

366
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,000
additive has been the challenge not the

367
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,560
early adoption whereas with robot uh

368
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,480
with robots it's actually the first

369
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,320
robot that is typically really hard

370
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,279
because you can't necessarily just roll

371
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,399
up a robot and um and have it you know

372
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,120
pick apart just like you be able to roll

373
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,199
in a printer and and make your first

374
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,000
prototype like a little toy or whatever

375
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
um would would come pre-programmed so

376
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,759
one of the challenges and one thing we

377
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,160
work on with with technology providers

378
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,560
is how to make that first experience

379
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,959
with the technology positive quicker and

380
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,320
lower cost for a customer um this is

381
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,560
quite separate from The scaleup

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,600
Challenge one one piece that I wanted to

383
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,040
note which you mentioned with Workforce

384
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,120
Development there's this real pickle

385
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,320
with um with Workforce Development

386
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,680
organizations in the US because I think

387
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,639
community colleges for a long time

388
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,199
really since the 1960s in the US have

389
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,920
been set up as really a jumping off

390
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,920
point for four years universities their

391
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,480
main um a lot of their funding comes

392
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,440
from how many students do you send to a

393
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,959
four-year college or university and

394
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,240
there's been less funding in

395
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,319
Massachusetts for example there just

396
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
isn't much funding at all if you find

397
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,040
someone a good job after your two-year

398
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,759
degree those aren't the incentives for

399
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,639
our community college in some cases our

400
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,079
vocational system so what would it take

401
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
to really shift that I think that uh

402
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,759
there are a few models for how this

403
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,160
might be done better one is in South

404
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,759
Carolina where BMW's investment South

405
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,000
Carolina in the early 1990s was hugely

406
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,000
INF influential in Shifting the course

407
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,959
of the South Carolina technical college

408
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,079
system that BMW comes in South Carolina

409
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,959
along with a number of other states

410
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,079
including Tennessee is all bidding for

411
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,480
this big BMW Factory and BMW says one of

412
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:18,759
the key components that we're going to

413
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,880
need wherever we invest is Workforce

414
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,600
Development this is something that we

415
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,240
have in Germany and we we realize that a

416
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,120
lot of these places in the early 90s

417
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,399
just didn't have a huge uh group of

418
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,199
skilled Automotive workers sitting

419
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,759
around waiting to to join BMW so the

420
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,880
South Carolina technical college system

421
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,600
to their credit said okay well we can

422
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,440
provide that we'll be open to

423
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,120
experimenting with you into providing

424
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,000
the skilled workers that you need so

425
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,440
when BMW moved in they brought the heads

426
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,040
of the technical college system in South

427
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,880
Carolina to Germany to study how the

428
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,600
baru schulen do it in and train

429
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,959
Automotive workers in Germany and they

430
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,079
brought some of those principles back to

431
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,720
South Carolina they set up an

432
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,040
apprenticeship system that wasn't just

433
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,639
for BMW but was for all the you know

434
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,360
suppliers and related companies and

435
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,800
extended Beyond Automotive such that now

436
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,000
um South Carolina went from one of the

437
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,640
lowest productivity States in

438
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,039
manufacturing and before BMW arrived to

439
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,439
one of the highest productivity States

440
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,240
and actually comparatively High wage

441
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,880
state today so I think that is you know

442
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,079
just a state level model that could be

443
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,160
replicated Y no that's awesome and

444
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:21,000
actually at MIT open learning I run a

445
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,559
learning platform called MIT Horizon uh

446
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,079
and we have a sister organization MIT

447
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,240
expro we work with BMW and and helping

448
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,919
like create across the entire

449
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,880
organization

450
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,600
AI education and we also work with SLB

451
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,880
and Aurora's organization um and

452
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,760
addressing I think uh this gentleman's

453
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,919
question earlier about the

454
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,440
transformation of the education system

455
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,880
because really we need to think about it

456
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,840
as a pipeline and how do we need to

457
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,280
rethink that with the work that we're in

458
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,559
now at

459
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,640
MIT um at up in learning we've created

460
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,320
something called agile continuous

461
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,159
education that is sort of a framework

462
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,080
around how how to think about that in a

463
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,880
new way I'd love to talk to you about

464
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,440
that more later if you'd like um and

465
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,400
then we're just starting a new

466
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,799
initiative around how do we think about

467
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,600
upscaling around Ai and uh we're going

468
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:18,280
to be working with community colleges in

469
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,440
numerous States um that Ben that's

470
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,840
really interesting to connect a DOT with

471
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,960
that work in in the Carolinas um we're

472
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,919
going to be working with Michigan uh

473
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,240
Georgia and Massachusetts to start and

474
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,080
so I think that there's a lot of there's

475
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,919
a lot of recognition around the need of

476
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,840
the transformation of uh the whole

477
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:44,120
Paradigm where it's no longer that you

478
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,640
go to school work and retire but that

479
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,360
that there's a whole shift around that

480
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,480
that we need to change the culture Liz

481
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,159
do you want to yeah I was just going to

482
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,600
say I think that speaks to the strength

483
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,679
of the US system the US system is got a

484
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,520
lot of experimentation and a lot of

485
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,480
places for on and off RS right as

486
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,480
opposed to the European model right but

487
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,600
the European model actually takes people

488
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,919
right across these you know these chasms

489
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,559
which is which is problematic so we have

490
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,799
to you know we lean into the strengths

491
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,080
of the system but we need to reinforce

492
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,080
it with uh some of these programs and

493
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,960
things that we we've been talking about

494
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:23,760
absolutely Aurora I want to come to you

495
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:27,039
and talk about culture change within an

496
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,799
organization like that that resistance a

497
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,240
lot of times like has talked a lot about

498
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,919
policy change and we sort of put policy

499
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,559
change into place at Academia we try to

500
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:41,039
build great systems and different things

501
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:43,000
but a lot of the challenge is within

502
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,720
organizations how do you change the

503
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,600
culture yes no absolutely and I think we

504
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,640
we went through a big culture Shi when

505
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,080
we first rebranded and that helped us a

506
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,240
lot because not only were we refocusing

507
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,200
what the company was all about but we

508
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,760
were bringing forward key behaviors and

509
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,559
EST in that um how can you say the same

510
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,840
language right to make that level of

511
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,760
psychological safety because one of the

512
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,360
reasons why uh one of the reasons why we

513
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,200
are afraid of change is because things

514
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,200
are different and we also have the

515
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,120
mentality of it can't change right it's

516
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,520
been like this for years it's working

517
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,320
now why mess with it so I think we're

518
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,280
we're having to get everybody involved

519
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,240
and say hey we're looking for better

520
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,799
ways to equip you better ways to do the

521
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,880
work so that you have a more impactful

522
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,520
everybody wants to have meaningful work

523
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,880
everybody wants to make an impact

524
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,000
regardless of where they are in the

525
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,360
organization and I think we're working

526
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,919
to have that culture shift with words

527
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,840
and saying we want you to be impactful

528
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,039
in what your job is what your day-to-day

529
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,080
job is what do you see that can make you

530
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:53,720
impactful and it does take time to build

531
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,360
some trust but I think it's through

532
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,760
examples and saying hey look at what we

533
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,520
did together and how did it change how

534
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,440
you do the work we still have of course

535
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,280
people that don't join in but we focus

536
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,280
on the Agents of change the people that

537
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,000
get interested in experimenting like the

538
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,080
example you gave with Sam he was

539
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,440
interested in doing things different so

540
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,000
we focus on those and we hope that the

541
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,520
rest will see the impact and

542
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,080
benefit awesome cus anything that you're

543
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,000
bringing into your organization yeah um

544
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,720
you know we have a challenge we're a new

545
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,720
company with new kind of a new whole new

546
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,919
category of Technology right AI for

547
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,320
manual operations and Manufacturing and

548
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,320
so when we first started talking to

549
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,080
customers there was this great uh

550
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,159
resistance fear of change um I was in

551
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,919
many meetings with uh a room of maybe 10

552
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,840
or 20 people all scowling at me and uh

553
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,000
these were the shop stewards Union reps

554
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,440
and they said you're here to take our

555
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,799
jobs away or you're here to make it uh

556
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,279
easier to fire people because you have

557
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,400
all this great data now on AI so we had

558
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,320
a big up uphill battle in the beginning

559
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,120
uh going out there and uh changing how

560
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,559
people think about AI in the workplace

561
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,640
um and luckily we're able to find some

562
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,080
solutions to those ways of managing

563
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,960
cultural change right um and just give

564
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:22,039
you a couple of solutions that we

565
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:25,440
discovered one um I think really make an

566
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:28,760
effort to find the benefits for all

567
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,520
stakeholders y that's one thing that uh

568
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,760
you know if if it only benefits one

569
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,480
group of stakeholders and doesn't

570
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,520
benefit the others may not harm them but

571
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,039
it doesn't benefit them then adoption is

572
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,840
very slow so that was one big lesson

573
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,200
right

574
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,360
away one thing that's interesting about

575
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,760
that where they're worried about getting

576
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,360
fired because the more data yeah that

577
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,159
they they must inherently think that

578
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,039
they're poor performers which it kind of

579
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,520
clicked because the story of you know

580
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,279
Colin Cuts in Ohio that I shared one of

581
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,279
the things that enables Colin to pay his

582
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,600
workers so much is he's able to look at

583
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,640
their performance and he gives them

584
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,880
bonuses for productivity increases so

585
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,360
they have a a Target and if they exceed

586
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,279
the Target and automation is helping

587
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,440
them do that they get a proportion of

588
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,120
the earnings over that Target and I've

589
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,720
talked to a bunch of other companies and

590
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,360
say like well do you have any incentive

591
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,440
programs well we tried something but the

592
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,840
workers resisted why would the workers

593
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,520
resist an incentive program and it's

594
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,520
must because they they're worried that

595
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,840
low performance would be a hindrance

596
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,080
versus good performance leading to

597
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,440
bonuses so yeah we we did this in the

598
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,480
survey I talked about we had two ideas

599
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,880
that might help workers be more open one

600
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,000
was um and this is coming out of a lot

601
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,640
of work in in the Sloan school at MIT is

602
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,960
that that if you they had more voice if

603
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,960
they were able to share more of their

604
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,039
ideas and opinions about how to deploy a

605
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,880
technology maybe they would be more open

606
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,600
they feel more ownership the second was

607
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,320
exactly like Financial incentives like

608
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,799
maybe if you were measure that you got

609
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,240
you were more productive you could pay

610
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,679
so we set up this experiment where we

611
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,159
gave some workers we said there's this

612
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,000
new technology introduced you just have

613
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,799
to live with it some you get to like

614
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,679
shape how it's you get to provide voice

615
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,240
then the third was you have to live with

616
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,039
it but if you improve your performance

617
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,120
you get a bonus and the worker voice and

618
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,520
that you just have to live with it were

619
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,200
exactly the same workers weren't more

620
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,640
open to the technology they treated it

621
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,960
the same way but then the financial

622
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,960
incentives it was off the charts they

623
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,120
thought it was much better and not just

624
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,960
for their pay but also for their job

625
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,200
security and their kind of satisfaction

626
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,520
with it so it did it did kind of lead us

627
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,799
to question some of this idea that

628
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,120
workers just want ownership uh in theory

629
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,360
whereas in practice they they want to

630
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,840
get paid and it makes sense yeah yeah it

631
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,279
really does so I think uh you know

632
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,399
talking whether it's Union shops or

633
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,919
non-union shops talking about how uh

634
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:36,679
monthly targets are going to get hit

635
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,200
more often right and the other side of

636
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,919
that is that um a lot of times the

637
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,520
reason monthly targets aren't hit is out

638
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,960
of the hands of the front line people

639
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,320
are not lazy they're working their asses

640
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,960
off and they're doing hard hard dirty

641
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,440
jobs sometimes so you know when when

642
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,080
when the company as a whole misses

643
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,480
targets you know there's a lot of blame

644
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,960
going around and so how to figure out

645
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,240
what is the root cause of us missing our

646
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,279
performance targets every month

647
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,559
and sometimes the root cause was really

648
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,919
hard to find it's really hard without

649
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,480
good data especially on uh the data poor

650
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,000
parts of the factory like the manual

651
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,799
parts so what came out of a lot of

652
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,799
discussions with Frontline people that

653
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,159
we Frontline workers that we talked to

654
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,520
they said I've been telling my boss for

655
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,279
10 years there's a better way to do this

656
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,000
it says bass Awards you got to do it

657
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:24,200
this way but no one ever listens to me

658
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,960
and uh so when we put our system in this

659
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,600
AI that can understand work and then

660
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,880
everyone could see the data they the and

661
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,360
everyone saw the data this is the

662
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,799
democratization it's not like there's

663
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,440
three people who get to see this new

664
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,200
data and then there's 100 people who

665
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,520
don't we we try so hard to get our

666
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,480
customers to understand that there's no

667
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,240
extra cost give every employee access to

668
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,399
this data you just give them a password

669
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,480
they can log in and see the the cycle

670
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:52,000
times you can see the non-value ad time

671
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,000
so when that happens when the doors open

672
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,080
everybody some very very intelligent

673
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,320
people who are working all day

674
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,960
assembling things see this data they say

675
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,120
look I just did this without anybody

676
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,640
knowing I did it right yesterday and

677
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,679
look at yesterday's data look how we got

678
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,399
20% more output so this kind of flips

679
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,000
the script and creates a new kind of

680
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,000
symmetry where there was some asymmetry

681
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,520
before and that creates uh so many other

682
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,919
KnockOn effects better safety uh better

683
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,799
uh retention um shorter training times

684
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,520
because you can use all this AI data to

685
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,799
help improve training there's all sorts

686
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,480
of other benefits that come along but

687
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,760
the cultural shift has to happen first

688
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
it has to be the right kind of cultural

689
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
change

690
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,360
uh it's also a change last thing I'll

691
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,679
say is an ownership you know who owns

692
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,960
this problem is it the ship supervisor

693
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,520
is it the uh coo the plant manager or is

694
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,080
it everybody and unless everybody knows

695
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,520
the problems and can really see how to

696
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,520
fix them and do their own root cause

697
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,240
thinking it's never everybody's problem

698
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,679
unless you can do that so that's the

699
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,080
transformation we're seeing with this

700
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,399
data flowing and and everybody thinking

701
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,960
about things differently suddenly

702
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,559
everybody owns a problem and then

703
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,240
everybody can work towards a solution so

704
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,240
that has been a real interesting trans

705
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,760
information we've noticed within our

706
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,679
customers by doing this yeah I would

707
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,200
just add on that one you know everyone

708
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,279
owning the problem um that's at the

709
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,320
heart of continuous Improvement right is

710
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,840
that everybody sees that and so I think

711
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,320
we need to see this almost as an

712
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,320
evolution of the whole you know lean

713
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,559
movement is now you know we have uh

714
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,520
augmented lean as a concept and you know

715
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:26,159
what is the digital overlay on that and

716
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,880
so building that into the into the

717
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,320
culture is really important and I I've

718
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,840
been in dialogue with a um head of

719
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,640
manufacturing for a large multinational

720
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,279
Life Sciences company and talk about

721
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,960
culture this this guy's ex-marine he is

722
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,240
not messing around 20 years he's been

723
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,039
running operations for this you know

724
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,399
International life science company and

725
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,279
he just has not been able to crack the

726
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,799
code on how to get his quality people to

727
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,399
you know facilitate a little bit more

728
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,840
efficiency in the system because of

729
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,919
course they you know under a regulated

730
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,880
system FDA is checking on your uh GMP

731
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,960
you know all of this um but he has this

732
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,640
idea of buying from the top buying from

733
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,640
the sea Suite is so essential right you

734
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,880
can do a top bottom up and a top down

735
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,120
but you you can't but really I don't

736
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,480
think you can really make the progress

737
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,720
without the top down buyin and um so to

738
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,880
watch him you know just bring his Marine

739
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,880
skill set into the into his operation to

740
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,360
bring along the certainly the quality

741
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,600
people to understand that you don't need

742
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,039
to have a require M for every single

743
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,679
step of the process there are things we

744
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,320
can do to bring in digital to make this

745
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,399
more efficient that people's jobs are

746
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,120
not at at risk I think has been

747
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:43,200
fascinating to me to you know an eye

748
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,679
opening about exactly the how of this

749
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,039
within organizations

750
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,360
super I want to take do a speed round

751
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,840
like to bring up the pace first I'm

752
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,600
going to ask a question of the audience

753
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,919
I'm very curious how many of you are

754
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,880
using

755
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,880
generative AI in your

756
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,240
work like majority how many of you use

757
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,760
it every

758
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:17,039
day quite as many and how many of you

759
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,039
using it because it's mandated by your

760
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,240
work ah interesting you're using it

761
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,000
personally because you're adopting tools

762
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,480
that's really interesting okay so the

763
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,279
speed round the first one we're going to

764
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,399
do is what is the most important skill

765
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,840
for the workforce of the future what do

766
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,760
they need to know Liz you want to take

767
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,559
that first uh I'm I'm going to say you

768
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,039
know flexibility flexibility excellent

769
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:47,200
Ben openness uh interpreting data

770
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,799
interpreting data okay curiosity

771
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,840
open-minded

772
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,039
yes I'm going to say

773
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,360
grit oh we just made an excellent

774
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:58,440
employee I think with all of those with

775
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,559
all of those pieces excellent anyone

776
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,320
want to shout out something what what

777
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,240
what are other skills that you think are

778
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,760
really important

779
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,760
yes D

780
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,399
yeah

781
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,960
yeah yeah

782
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,360
okay

783
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,480
yeah it's fine I think we're just we're

784
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,200
just sort of shouting out because I'm

785
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,360
going back to next speed round and

786
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,279
cyberus will go with you is what's the

787
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,880
one major

788
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,120
misconception about work of the future

789
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,760
and what that's going to be like do I

790
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,799
get one sentence or you get you you get

791
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,519
you get 15 seconds oh 15 seconds okay um

792
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,200
I think the major misconception is that

793
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,120
uh humans are replaceable ah um there

794
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,720
are I think if you think about it in a

795
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,720
big big picture certain things that will

796
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,000
not technically be uh replaceable with

797
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,279
software or robots in our lifetimes so

798
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,840
let's just think about our lifetimes

799
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:16,519
right and maybe our kids lifetimes um I

800
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,200
think there's a lot of uh dubious

801
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:22,120
information out there projecting uh you

802
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,720
know all this technology uh being human

803
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,760
grade or humanik and uh even I'm an AI

804
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,600
practitioner I sell AI software I see on

805
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,159
the inside how slow and difficult things

806
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,639
are so I think there's a a definite

807
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,880
misconception that um the flexibility

808
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:41,360
and the dexterity and the social

809
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,360
cognition of humans is going to be

810
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,720
replaceable in in in the next two

811
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,279
lifetimes I don't think it is all right

812
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,919
good good to know happy about that one

813
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:53,039
or so for me misconception is where the

814
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,720
where this technology can be applied I

815
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,679
think sometimes we Overlook some of the

816
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,279
areas that could widely benefit from the

817
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,799
new technology I mean we HR could

818
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,159
benefit from it right uh mult legal can

819
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,919
benefit from it I know we focus on the

820
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,559
new and shiny Technologies for solving

821
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,480
the big problems that we see but there's

822
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:14,600
a lot of hidden opportunities and I

823
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,919
think

824
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,240
demystifying the technology for

825
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,039
everybody a big believer and stem but I

826
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,279
think there's a lot of other fields

827
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:28,000
where this can be really lifechanging so

828
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:30,000
where we apply it needs to open

829
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,960
I think you know looking at short-term

830
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,039
productivity as the main uh objective I

831
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,279
think is a is a misconception and I I

832
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:41,600
think about long-term skill atrophy as a

833
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:43,960
big risk of new technology and you know

834
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,320
uh I think you we've all seen it maybe

835
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,279
in our own experiences with AI over the

836
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,880
last 10 years and adopting things like

837
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,399
Google Maps and ways and our ability to

838
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,480
navigate the world on our own um I just

839
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,200
uh think about my my mother-in-law who

840
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,880
is is relatively anti-technology ology

841
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,399
but when her Google Maps went down

842
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,840
trying to drive to New York she had to

843
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:04,519
pull off and you know go to a gas

844
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,919
station and get directions and it's like

845
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,480
you know it's it's one highway it's all

846
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,720
the way to New York but um I do think

847
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,120
that that we've we've undervalued the

848
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,440
challenges of of skill atrophy in

849
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,200
software community and the these

850
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,519
trade-offs that typically come with with

851
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,480
adopting new technologies the other

852
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,639
comment I'll make is um you know we've

853
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,919
also had now going on 15 20 years of

854
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:28,480
screens in the classroom and

855
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:29,720
digitization of educ

856
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,080
and test scores in the United States

857
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,279
have not improved so this idea that you

858
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,559
know technology can make us smarter can

859
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:39,240
improve um education it hasn't on the

860
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,639
maybe we're measuring it wrong but it

861
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,559
hasn't on the measures that we care

862
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:44,039
about so um I think we need to look

863
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,320
ourselves in the mirror about how we

864
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:48,399
educate our our children and what skills

865
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,120
we're developing um if we want them to

866
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,159
thrive in this environment maybe the

867
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,240
tools of the work environment might not

868
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,880
be the best tools for the

869
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,279
classroom um so first I just would um

870
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,279
reiterate or underscore what Cyrus said

871
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,760
about humans in the loop I think that'

872
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,159
be a really interesting discussion with

873
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,519
this group right there's a there's a

874
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,919
voice out there that says we're we're

875
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,320
all heading toward the lights out

876
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,520
Factory and I think there's a a big

877
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,000
question mark about what that looks like

878
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:19,040
and as we um used to say in one of our

879
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,520
uh projects in MIT you can't innovate in

880
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,200
a lights out Factory and so you know

881
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,879
where is that really heading what what

882
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,720
kind of production will that speak to

883
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,040
versus other production but the the

884
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,919
point I would make on on myth is that is

885
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,119
that somehow this um the the sort of

886
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,399
transformation on the skill set is

887
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,520
really we need to really focus on shop

888
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,720
floor in fact when we spoke to

889
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,679
organizations they say the problem is as

890
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,399
much you know with management and with

891
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,919
our Engineers as it is with the

892
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:52,760
Frontline worker and that this approach

893
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:55,280
to changing you know toward a digital um

894
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,200
production system is really a culture

895
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,640
that is goes from top to bottom of an

896
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,640
organization

897
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,320
culture the word okay I've got a lot of

898
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,800
questions but I also want to hear from

899
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,920
you so we've got the mics here and

900
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,880
question

901
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,480
here I'm uh thas Gonzalez I work with

902
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,280
Baker Hughes but I'm an MIT Alum uh

903
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,760
quick plug on Manchester you have one of

904
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,200
the best exports for the world it's

905
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,040
called first oh yes so if you haven't

906
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,920
heard about first robotics gracious

907
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,880
professionalism and coor petition that's

908
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,160
a really good thing to research uh also

909
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,079
open course Weare and edex or we're part

910
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,720
of MIT is there going to be a curriculum

911
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,000
design about the workforce of the future

912
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,560
there well there is right now an

913
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,920
offering from uh Tom Cen um you were you

914
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,680
participating that you you did it with

915
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,960
Tom I I yes I you well so there is you

916
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,359
know it turns out of course this is a

917
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,480
topic for uh you know doesn't matter

918
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,960
where you're coming from this is an

919
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,720
interesting topic so we did actually

920
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,800
translate the work of the future task

921
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,680
Force into an online course uh that Tom

922
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,680
Cen who is now a Meritus from Sloan uh

923
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,920
set up um and I and so people have

924
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,359
access to that but I would also say um

925
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,680
there's a lot going on in the

926
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,280
manufacturing space that that also that

927
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,400
Ben can talk about in terms of specific

928
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,839
skills but all broader skills around

929
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,200
industrial transformation is that fair

930
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,280
to say Ben yeah I think the one kind

931
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,040
this is you know very early stages but

932
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,960
one comment that has stuck with me from

933
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,920
a really you know we've been trying to

934
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,599
study these high performing

935
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,319
manufacturers and look at them as models

936
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,480
of you know they're double the national

937
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:37,079
level of productivity how would you

938
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,560
replicate them and one had this really

939
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,800
interesting comment about the workers he

940
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,880
was looking for because he had found

941
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,040
these terrific multi-talented people to

942
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,319
work on the shop floor and he said

943
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,720
really what we need is we need kind of

944
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:50,240
like the MIT of vocational schools or

945
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,560
the Carnegie melon of educational the

946
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,200
Stanford yeah and and what we have is

947
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,640
really a flat um you know not

948
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,560
necessarily centers of excellence for

949
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,599
vocational training so I think there

950
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,720
there's some going to be some

951
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,920
experimentation and work with that of

952
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,720
how we can take MIT curriculum that's

953
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,599
currently directed toward graduate level

954
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,160
engineers and bring them towards someone

955
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,920
who might have 10 to 15 years on the

956
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,640
shop floor and is ready to take the next

957
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,960
step but perhaps also the U of

958
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:20,960
Excellence of Excellence yeah in the

959
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,960
Texas A&M I know Texas A&M over there

960
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:35,119
hi um my name is O I work with Chevron I

961
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,880
have a question around nomadic talent

962
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,359
talent particularly with the younger

963
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,359
generation in which people don't stay

964
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,160
longer in positions or in jobs anymore

965
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,920
they hop two three years two three years

966
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,599
two three years it it's significantly

967
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,400
disruptive when it comes to building

968
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,720
deep

969
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,640
skills and it's also maybe I'm dating

970
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,359
myself is also reflective of not being

971
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,520
connected with the misss of whatever

972
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,839
Enterprise or industry they're in and so

973
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,119
it's a case of yeah I do this for a

974
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:09,520
couple of weeks and I'm gone and so

975
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,000
thoughts around

976
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,720
that W to I want to say something

977
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,200
because uh and CH yes so SLV you know we

978
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,560
I've had many different jobs so I've

979
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,520
been with them 19 years but I've had so

980
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,319
many different jobs it's not uncommon

981
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,359
for me to change job every two three

982
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:28,560
years we're actually looking to see how

983
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:30,640
to slow that down so what we see with

984
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,640
the new Talent we tell them you don't

985
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,800
have to leave you want to do something

986
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,119
different look at the wide range this is

987
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,240
something that a company can offer I've

988
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,280
never gotten bored of a job like just

989
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,079
when I feel comfortable they change it

990
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,119
on me so I think that's one of the

991
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,920
things they leave because they want a

992
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,079
new challenge they want to do something

993
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,119
different I think not everybody perhaps

994
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,000
in the new generations wants that but

995
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,040
the ones I do they want the variety and

996
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,560
I think large organizations can look and

997
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,520
see within themselves can we offer the

998
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,400
variety inside before the candidate or

999
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,560
employee comes and says hey I want to do

1000
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,800
something different you can say hey like

1001
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,200
maybe you have a limited space where you

1002
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,440
can move them but I think it's important

1003
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:16,079
for organizations to look and see also

1004
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,760
how they can change inside to let's say

1005
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,440
Foster the need for change that the new

1006
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,920
generation is bringing maybe they're

1007
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,760
just wanting to do things differently so

1008
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,200
how can we Foster them within large

1009
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,119
organizations to allow them to do that

1010
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,480
at I think it's a good question to have

1011
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,359
versus trying to fix a generation right

1012
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,119
each generation feels they have the

1013
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,119
answer to everything so I think we just

1014
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,280
need to focus on how we can work cross

1015
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,720
generation I want to ask the audience a

1016
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,160
question and then I see that question

1017
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:49,079
over there how many of you have been in

1018
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,079
the same organization for 10

1019
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,960
years okay how about

1020
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:03,480
15 20

1021
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,760
interesting wow okay yeah um I think

1022
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,800
there's a question over here and then if

1023
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,880
we can get the mic over

1024
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,000
there hello um my name is Le Yar and I'm

1025
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,000
a freshman at Texas A&M I'm studying

1026
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
mechanical engineering and my ultimate

1027
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,160
goal is to be a Serial Tech entrepreneur

1028
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,400
like Elon Musk I have a question for you

1029
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,400
Mr uh Cyrus um one thing that you said

1030
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,880
to me that stood out was that uh you

1031
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,680
want to benefit all stakeholders whether

1032
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,880
it's with the software or is with the

1033
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:35,280
policies and I was wondering if that's

1034
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,240
unrealistic um I don't think it is I

1035
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,960
don't think it is uh but I do get that a

1036
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:45,359
lot um this idea that uh it's a zero sum

1037
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,440
game so if um you know the engineers who

1038
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,960
are doing design have a better

1039
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,599
technology to help them Design Systems

1040
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,040
better well that's going to make the

1041
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,640
assembly harder and so the assembly team

1042
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,000
will lose or something crazy like that

1043
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:01,839
you know more often it's the idea that

1044
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,160
um there's G be big brother watching the

1045
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,240
the sort of the the the teams that are

1046
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,280
actually doing the work and the

1047
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,920
management will have this data set and

1048
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,640
then use it to punish people or to uh do

1049
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,040
other things that that maybe not so

1050
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,160
kosher so you know that that that that

1051
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,560
that's something that that we worried

1052
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,319
about a lot in the beginning and so

1053
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,200
we've tried to make our product built so

1054
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,839
that it's hard to do those things so for

1055
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,839
example we do a lot of stuff to protect

1056
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,880
privacy by blurring video so that you

1057
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,280
can't see who's who or by deleting video

1058
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,839
so that the data is there but the video

1059
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,200
isn't so we've tried to make it harder

1060
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:39,960
and harder to um use this tool in ways

1061
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,880
that don't benefit all or that benefit

1062
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,160
only a couple of stakeholders so it is

1063
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,839
always a challenge but um it's something

1064
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,800
that I think you know if you use tools

1065
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,440
like AI tools incorrectly you can

1066
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,359
destroy your culture and maybe even

1067
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,839
destroy your company if you use them

1068
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:57,880
well then you can really uh see that

1069
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,800
kind of Big Boost uh and be of course I

1070
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,880
think better than the competition like

1071
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,680
how does America come back against Asia

1072
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,319
right right now talk about the global uh

1073
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,280
manufacturing situation uh we have

1074
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:11,880
reshoring going on we have near Shoring

1075
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,359
going on in Mexico we have uh a

1076
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,839
potential trade war with uh China and

1077
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:20,440
other parts of the world so thinking

1078
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:22,400
about it like that um you know the US is

1079
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,400
seeing a lot of great news stories in

1080
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,280
the last few years in the manufacturing

1081
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,680
sector that could flip around and things

1082
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,800
could go right back

1083
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,480
to Asia again depending on the way the

1084
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,720
wind blows so to make a globally

1085
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,400
competitive us manufacturing sector long

1086
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,480
term there has to be something that sets

1087
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,280
us apart that makes American

1088
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,559
manufacturing better and different than

1089
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,280
every place around the world to me it's

1090
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,160
this uh adoption of better technology

1091
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,680
and doing things in a very very smart

1092
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,720
way so that even though we pay our

1093
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,280
workers 10 times more than somebody in

1094
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,800
another country they're 10 or 20 times

1095
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,520
more productive so to benefit all s

1096
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,520
holders using the best technology and

1097
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,040
bringing America to the place where it

1098
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,760
can continue to compete for the next

1099
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,400
many years on the world stage that's the

1100
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,559
way to do it and I think the only way to

1101
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,040
do it the only way out of this hole is

1102
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,480
better use of technology and uh and

1103
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,359
really focusing on productivity I don't

1104
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,960
know what do you think Elizabeth yeah I

1105
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,960
I mean I agree I think the the point is

1106
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,599
we have to do it differently you're not

1107
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,559
reshoring from China you know with the

1108
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,359
same productive production systems

1109
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,359
you're doing it differently and that's

1110
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,119
where use of the advanced Manufacturing

1111
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,839
Technologies really plays to our

1112
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,800
advantage and so that's you know that's

1113
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,760
what the game is I think going forward

1114
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,520
across all of these areas that we care

1115
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,480
about uh from a national and economic

1116
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,119
security point of view but also where

1117
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,359
you know growth is happening where

1118
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,319
Ventures investing you know the that

1119
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,680
people see this opportunity and see

1120
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:53,440
where the US you know can um can have a

1121
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,839
competitive Advantage y last question um

1122
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,800
my name is basil fared uh I'm coming

1123
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,559
from software engineering AI background

1124
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,319
uh I think this gentleman's question uh

1125
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,119
from shevron I don't think it was

1126
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:09,119
addressed in my view I think the way I

1127
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,680
understood the question was that in the

1128
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,520
backdrop of the H example for example

1129
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,480
you know operating complex machine uh

1130
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,480
that tendency on the mindset is lost in

1131
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,200
the new generation so I think the

1132
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,200
question was addressing how can the

1133
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,680
companies keep people uh in in that same

1134
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,720
profession for a longer period of time

1135
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,960
rather than just shifting the roles

1136
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,000
because then they're not developing

1137
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,760
deepest skills so maybe you can

1138
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,359
elaborate on that a few thoughts so one

1139
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,800
I don't think that the goal is no

1140
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,800
turnover right no turnover is actually

1141
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,640
not a good solution you want actually

1142
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,440
people with new ideas coming in from

1143
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,680
competitors from adjacent Industries Etc

1144
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,319
I think just to go to the Elon Musk and

1145
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,880
Tesla example one of the really

1146
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,760
brilliant things about Tesla was that

1147
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,920
they brought in people not just from The

1148
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,000
Usual Suspects the Toyotas the GMS but

1149
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,280
they also brought in people from the

1150
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,680
semiconductor industry and people from

1151
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,640
the chemicals industry and then of

1152
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,400
course all sorts of software Engineers

1153
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,640
from you know Apple and Google that that

1154
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,599
brought different sorts of ideas they

1155
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,480
had to develop a Common Language and

1156
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,640
really a new way of of producing a a car

1157
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,960
so so in that case the new ideas from

1158
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,160
outside were really valuable but then

1159
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,839
the next question is how do you stay at

1160
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,839
a place long enough to really gain those

1161
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:24,640
valuable skills that you could bring to

1162
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,079
another location I think this is I would

1163
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,119
point you to some of zup Ton's work um

1164
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,720
at at MIT where she she initially wrote

1165
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,240
a book called you know the good jobs

1166
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,319
strategy which was all about how

1167
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,119
companies I think the threat in her work

1168
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,200
is that that corporations can be

1169
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,359
systematically irrational irrational and

1170
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,880
predictable ways that sometimes they

1171
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:46,400
offer irrationally low wages because

1172
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,400
just that they raise those wages they

1173
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,720
see productivity gains in their workers

1174
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,880
that you know out value the increase in

1175
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,760
wages so they actually become more

1176
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,480
profitable while increasing wages she

1177
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,000
studied this at in retail and fast food

1178
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,119
which I think is a remarkable finding

1179
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,319
and then more recently she studied how

1180
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,200
uh firms they undervalue the cost of

1181
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:07,720
turnover so really what what you're

1182
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,400
suggesting is that firms have been

1183
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,839
unwilling to raise wages enough or to

1184
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,680
offer enough incentives to keep workers

1185
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,920
such that they're then spending more on

1186
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,240
replacing them than they could have

1187
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,880
spent on just keeping them there or

1188
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,599
offering them a a career ladder um to

1189
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,200
keep them so I think this is really just

1190
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,520
an irrational Behavior where we've

1191
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,920
allowed High turnover to persist in part

1192
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,440
because we've been unwilling to offer

1193
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,880
wages bonuses other

1194
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,200
incentives just an anecdote to that that

1195
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,839
this is a real issue that the Department

1196
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,920
of Defense is looking at right that the

1197
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:41,400
defense uh you know and the services

1198
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,359
have a rotation systematic rotation for

1199
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,960
everybody and that ultimately that's

1200
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,400
actually not helping our deeper skill

1201
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,319
set and our ability to sort of see

1202
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,280
Innovations or you know new production

1203
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,119
systems over a longer period of time so

1204
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,440
there's there's discussion about how to

1205
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,800
change

1206
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,760
that horrific

1207
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,440
so we are coming to a close final

1208
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,599
question and we'll do it

1209
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,280
quickly we're back together in five

1210
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,960
years it's been a long five years um

1211
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,480
what do you hope that we'll be talking

1212
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,920
about Cyrus kick us off I think we're

1213
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:20,480
talking about um how the promise of AI

1214
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,960
came true but also did not come true and

1215
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
and how that worked out I'm interested

1216
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,319
in singing okay F in the blanks I would

1217
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,400
like to see us talking more about cross

1218
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,200
collaboration

1219
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,319
across Industries how we can foster

1220
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,319
because I think there's a lot of benefit

1221
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:36,000
even like with Academia and Industry how

1222
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,839
can we benefit from the crossroads in

1223
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,040
between the silos so I want to hear us

1224
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,920
talk about more collaboration to keep

1225
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,280
advancing on the newer technology that

1226
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,400
will be here in five years Ben I'd love

1227
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,119
to see more uh experiments more you know

1228
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,480
risk-taking and positive examples I

1229
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:54,200
don't think A lot's going to change in

1230
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,319
in five years uh or a lot can change on

1231
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,720
kind of the technology front but um I

1232
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,800
think a lot more uh you know momentum

1233
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,800
with the experiments would be good I

1234
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,000
would love us to be talking about how we

1235
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,400
have energized the Next Generation to

1236
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
enter into career paths in manufacturing

1237
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,599
and that we've done it by expanding into

1238
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,720
non-traditional communities or you know

1239
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,040
areas where we haven't had as much

1240
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,680
representation um and we see really

1241
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,280
exciting new Pathways to kind of the

1242
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,960
middle class um through through these

1243
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:30,280
manufacturing awesome I hope you enjoyed

1244
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,319
in 5 years but than that we're going to

1245
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,319
move on to our next sess so thank you

1246
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,319
panel
