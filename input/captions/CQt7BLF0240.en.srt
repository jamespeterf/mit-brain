Sciences platforms along reads Group

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,520
which aims to transform the genomics

15
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:38,239
landscape by undertaking long read

trust Center um for human genetics and

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,359
he also completed post-doctoral studies

22
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,719
at the Oxford Big Data Institute he

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,079
co-chairs the nih's all of us long read

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,280
working group and also the nih's

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,119
Gabriella Miller kids first long read

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,600
working group we're both undertaking I'm

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,360
sorry which are both undertaking the

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,960
discovery and Analysis of previously

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,560
unseen variation in about 20,000 diverse

30
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,960
individuals for population genomics and

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
rare disease

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,840
applications um and today he's going to

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,520
be doing a part two um on Long read

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,680
sequencing which I'm really excited

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,520
about um I've had the chance to play

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,439
with long read data myself and to load

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,920
it into igv and to keep scrolling and to

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,880
see the keep going is um it's amazing so

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,119
really excited uh Karen take it away

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,840
right Fant please ask questions along

41
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,399
the way thank you all right fantastic

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
can everyone hear

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,799
me that's fantastic in fact talk to me

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
after the meeting uh there I don't know

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
if you've joined the the the working

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,039
group but we

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,280
have

48
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,759
okay now they found them okay more than

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,200
happy to to to um talk about it after

50
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,239
the after the meeting but that's very

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,680
exciting right um okay um uh first of

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,680
all thank you for having me back uh I

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,840
think I was here in June July something

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,760
like that uh and I gave what was what

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,040
you know I had intended to be a a a a

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
fairly comprehensive overview of of long

57
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,560
sequencing um there was so much to talk

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,000
about that I didn't get to everything so

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm very happy to have this opportunity

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
to come back and share some of the

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,360
things that I uh didn't get to speak

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,599
about last time if you didn't see the

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
talk last time I'm just going to leave

64
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,680
the slide up for a second you can go to

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,200
the QR code it'll take you to uh the

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,360
Youtube video uh but last time I talked

67
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,879
about uh in general how the pack bio and

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,599
Oxford nanoport platforms worked uh I

69
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,680
talked about some of the sort of basic

70
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,560
operations in terms of alignment of

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,360
reads to a a reference sequence uh I

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,000
talked about snip and indel and

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
structural variant calling and copy

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,319
number variant calling uh and a few

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,640
other topics uh uh along the way uh I'm

76
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,319
if people did see that talk I'm more

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,400
than happy to answer questions about it

78
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,920
here uh along the way um uh but I'm

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,360
going to I'm going to skip some a lot of

80
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,959
the details that I presented in that in

81
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,120
that last presentation so please if you

82
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,720
are new to Long read sequencing and

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,560
starting to you know just trying to get

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,680
a handle on the data um you know go

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,200
there and and I you're more than welcome

86
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,000
to reach out to me as well um I think my

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,200
email address is probably somewhere on

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,280
this slide um uh but that's what I'm

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,280
here for I'm I'm more than happy to to

90
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,640
to um answer questions and get people

91
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,519
acquainted with this data uh today I'm

92
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,400
going to talk about um a few things I'm

93
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,120
going to talk about um just a a quick

94
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,280
review of how the instruments work not

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,439
quite as in depth as I went in last time

96
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,879
and I'm going to talk about um three

97
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,159
additional topics uh the first is some

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,640
updates uh to these instruments it's

99
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,640
only been a few months and there are

100
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,239
still uh you know exciting updates to to

101
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,239
both of these platforms is how fast this

102
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,799
field is moving uh I'll also talk about

103
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,239
methylation calling which I didn't get

104
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,479
to in the last uh talk and I will talk

105
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,400
about some of the targeted sequencing

106
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:29,960
capabilities uh of the of the nanopore

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,759
platform so let's quickly recap the the

108
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,160
Bas uh Basics how what are we what are

109
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,160
we doing with long reads what are we

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,000
talking about when we talk about long

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,000
reads I think most of the audience here

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,080
will probably be familiar with short

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,240
read sequencing 150 to 200 uh bases

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,720
paired end format uh kind of the

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,320
Workhorse of our our field today but

116
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,639
with you know W with limitations uh

117
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,600
right there are um you know places in

118
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,639
the genome particularly uh repeat

119
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,880
expansions uh um low complexity sequence

120
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,919
in general or just places in the in in

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,440
the reference that are uh quite

122
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,880
Divergent from the sample of Interest

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,600
where short reads just fail to align and

124
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,840
fail to give you a a uh a decent picture

125
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,000
of what variation at that Locus looks

126
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,520
like long ra sequencing about two orders

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,199
of magnitude longer in in read lengths

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,960
uh and with that comes the ability to

129
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,639
map much more confidently uh across

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,000
repetitive regions across uh large

131
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,240
structural variants uh being used to

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,840
help uh create new versions uh you of

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,000
the uh of um reference sequences with

134
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
all of the gaps closed as the telr to

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,639
telare project and related the human

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,039
Pang genum reference Consortium we've

137
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,520
been using them for the all of us

138
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,560
project to get a clearer picture of

139
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,919
structural variation in a population

140
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,520
genetic setting been using them in in in

141
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,560
Gabriella Miller kids first to get a

142
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,639
clearer picture of potentially causal uh

143
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,280
variation you namely structural

144
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,880
variation repeat expansions in in rare

145
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,240
disease

146
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,759
contexts uh you know a few years ago the

147
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,599
broad had one of these instruments as a

148
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,919
prototype just for uh some

149
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,039
experimentation now it's uh you know

150
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,039
become it's become a a full-on

151
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,360
production device I I don't remember how

152
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,840
many uh instruments are in uh in BCL it

153
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,199
it it changes as instruments get

154
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,360
upgraded and swapped out but uh I think

155
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,880
there are somewhere between five and 10

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,120
of the the latest instruments and a uh

157
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,440
nanapur instrument as well uh I think

158
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,400
that makes the Bro the largest long

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,199
breed Sequencing Center in the world at

160
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,440
the moment uh but I wouldn't be

161
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,280
surprised if those you know those

162
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,240
numbers fluctuate over time what are we

163
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,919
doing with these structural variants I

164
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,000
like this example this is from one of my

165
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,680
colleagues frit sedc uh at uh Bor

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,960
College of Medicine uh and in this uh in

167
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,199
these two images he depicts very clearly

168
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,039
what the value is of long read

169
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,639
sequencing versus short read sequencing

170
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,960
so the top track is aluminous sequencing

171
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,199
on the left a deletion on the right an

172
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,039
insertion on the left you see this

173
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,960
deletion uh you know kind of clear as

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,199
day in the uh in the short read data but

175
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,280
what what you're seeing is just an

176
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,039
absence of sequencing data it's actually

177
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,360
hard to distinguish that between uh you

178
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,879
know a a true deletion versus a place

179
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,360
that just didn't get any any coverage

180
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,120
whatsoever paraden reads helps with this

181
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,000
but you can see the uh the the the reads

182
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,319
in this igv screenshot that are color

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,319
something other than gray indicate that

184
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,240
the pair the mate of this uh the this

185
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
this end of the paired end read is

186
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,360
mapped somewhere that you wouldn't

187
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,879
expect right so even with that paired

188
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,280
information it could be hard to

189
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,560
reconstruct uh deletions of a of a

190
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,840
certain size whereas the 20,000 base or

191
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,199
so reads that you get from both P bio

192
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,199
platforms and nanopore platforms read

193
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,840
through that without ambiguity right you

194
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,240
know that this is not a coverage loss

195
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,440
you know that there is an actual uh uh

196
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,960
deletion at this Locus as evidence from

197
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,800
the reads same thing with the insertion

198
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,560
the illumin data there seems to be some

199
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,319
signal in the in the paradin reads uh

200
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,680
but again there are a lot of mismapped

201
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,720
pairs and it's really unclear it's

202
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,080
actually surprising ly unclear from this

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,120
example what is going on here uh hack

204
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
bio sequencing Ox anur sequencing

205
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,360
identify the insertion uh you know

206
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,440
fairly easily so I you know I I I spent

207
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
my PhD and my postto trying you know

208
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
desperately to reconstruct lo I like

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,800
this from short read sequencing about

210
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,680
halfway through my PhD I got long read

211
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,320
sequencing and it sort of obviated the

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,399
past three years of work uh which is

213
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,279
annoying at the time but really exciting

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,839
today when you see these problems that

215
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,040
have been you know so difficult to get

216
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,920
traction on for the past you know 10 or

217
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,640
15 years just appear in your data it's

218
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,200
it's really wonderful to

219
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,000
see how do the instruments work I

220
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,079
usually present this in in the order of

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,240
aluminous sequencing P bio sequencing

222
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:22,480
and and nanopore sequencing uh just

223
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,800
let's review very quickly how aluminous

224
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,120
sequencing and you'll see why I present

225
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,720
it in this order so aluminous sequencing

226
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,360
you could think of it as as as kind of

227
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,040
trying to uh uh trick a trick a

228
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,839
polymerase enzyme into doing a dirty

229
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,399
work here right uh you start with uh

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,800
single stranded uh DNA fragments to

231
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,720
which you uh attach sequencing adapters

232
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,399
complimentary adapter is attached to the

233
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,760
flow cell as you flow in all of the the

234
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,480
the fragments uh they bind to places on

235
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,200
that flow cell perform PCR extension

236
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,760
Bridge amplification in order to

237
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,200
generate a local CL cler of identical

238
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,120
templates uh those are then dissociated

239
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,760
into single stranded fragments uh those

240
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,079
form clusters and uh one cycle at a time

241
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,560
you flow in nucleotides uh with

242
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:19,720
fluorescent labels that attach to the um

243
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,040
the the the next available uh you know

244
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,920
occupancy spot in the in the single

245
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,880
stranded fragment pause image the

246
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,680
superposition of uh Flor fors at each

247
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
cluster register is a strong enough

248
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,800
signal that a camera can read that out

249
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,120
and call a base and then you proceed to

250
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,040
uh uh um uh flush the uh the Flor for

251
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,600
from the previous cycle at the next one

252
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,560
in stop and go you are essentially uh

253
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,200
you know sequencing uh this Bas one at a

254
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,240
time sequencing by by

255
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,920
synthesis uh pack bio sequencing is also

256
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,399
hijacking uh a polymerase in order to do

257
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:05,320
it dir work but rather than forming

258
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:09,279
these colonies of identical templates uh

259
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:13,200
the flow cell is designed uh with small

260
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,800
Wells that only house ideally one

261
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,000
polymerase enzyme so the the the correct

262
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,240
operation of these Wells is a single

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,320
polymerous enzyme affixed to the uh to

264
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,279
to to the bottom of the well sequencing

265
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,079
one read at a time and again we are FL

266
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,160
uh we're flowing in fluorescently

267
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,519
labeled nucleotides now the key

268
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,600
difference here between uh alumina

269
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,000
sequencing which is using a cluster of

270
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,880
templates in order to register a signal

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,240
versus Pac bio which is using uh

272
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,000
literally one one read not a not a

273
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,600
colony of reads not a cluster of reads

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,079
um uh is the fact that the the the label

275
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,959
nucleotides are freely diffusing in this

276
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:03,560
uh thermal bath except when they are

277
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,360
being incorporated into the uh the

278
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,200
single strand template at that time the

279
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,720
polymerases holding that PO that the um

280
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,079
that uh nucleotide in a a single spot

281
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,000
for much longer than the mean diffusion

282
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,720
time of the nucleotides that is enough

283
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,760
you know plus the construction of the

284
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,279
well in order to amplify light that is

285
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:30,279
enough for a a movie camera to image the

286
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,480
read in real time so what you get is a

287
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,760
readout that looks like the the the the

288
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,839
one below where you have um uh light

289
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,320
intensity the fluoresence of each

290
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:45,560
nucleotide uh in four different colors

291
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,600
but you also have uh a a a number of uh

292
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,880
kinetic uh readouts you have how long

293
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,959
did that pulse last what is the time

294
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,160
between the

295
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,360
pulses uh usually refer to as pulse

296
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,160
width and interpulse distance right so

297
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,760
you're getting more information you're

298
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,079
reading out this information in real

299
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,680
time and then the instrument based

300
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,800
caller is distilling that into into

301
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,199
nuclear type calls to get accuracy again

302
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,320
one of the ways that you get accuracy

303
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,600
from aluminous sequencing is that you

304
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,199
you have a colony of of reads that all

305
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,360
say the same thing so most of the Flor

306
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:22,760
four should agree with one another and

307
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,199
register a strong signal uh that signal

308
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,360
th those those colonies uh shrink as you

309
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:30,920
do sequencing just as you do the the

310
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,079
flush with each cycle some of those re

311
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,279
some of those fragments will wash away

312
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,680
and so the signal attenuates over the

313
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,519
the the course of the sequencing

314
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,760
experiment it doesn't happen for single

315
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,279
cell sequencing or single molecule

316
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,880
sequencing right there isn't anything

317
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,680
being being flushed away so basically

318
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,600
from the start of the read to the end of

319
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,079
the read it's it's more or less equal

320
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,000
quality it's still noisy you're reading

321
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:57,199
from a movie rather than uh from a uh

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,160
from a still image and it can be quite

323
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:05,440
difficult to know have I seen 3 A's or 4

324
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,480
A's or 5 A's or uh you know a repetitive

325
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,000
sequence Motif so there's still some

326
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,279
error correction that needs to be

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,320
applied uh in order to achieve that Pac

328
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,480
bio constructs it's uh um its fragments

329
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,920
for sequencing with a hairpin adapter on

330
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:27,120
each end called a smartbell adapter uh

331
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,600
and that allows the uh polymerase to to

332
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,680
anneal to one of the open parts of the

333
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,720
uh the The Hairpin adapter and begin

334
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,040
sequencing this polymerase has strand

335
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,759
displacement activity so as it is

336
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,519
synthesizing the complimentary strand

337
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,480
it's also displacing the Strand that was

338
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,600
already there so you get these circular

339
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
uh readouts of a of a single fragment

340
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,079
both forward and reverse Direction

341
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,959
usually something like uh um five to 15

342
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:57,600
passes around the around the molecule

343
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,680
and with those redundant passes they can

344
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,199
those redundant passes can be

345
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,480
uh um uh combined in order to generate a

346
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,759
high accuracy consensus read we

347
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,079
generally think that this is the the

348
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,320
corrected read is on par maybe a little

349
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,000
bit higher quality than than aluminous

350
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,519
sequencing

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,680
today nanopore sequencing now the the

352
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,480
interesting thing about nanopore

353
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,399
sequencing is unlike aluminous

354
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,440
sequencing and Pac bio sequencing

355
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,000
nanapur is not uh using a polymerase in

356
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,120
order to incorporate bases and and just

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,839
monitor the activity of the polymerase

358
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,759
instead nanapur is uh an electrical

359
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:43,440
readout so uh a a engineered pore sits

360
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:47,000
in a uh lipid bilayer uh and as uh and

361
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,480
as uh fragments pass through that pore

362
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,959
they generate a a current signal that

363
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,639
current is characteristic of whatever is

364
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:58,519
being read whether it's a modified or

365
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,600
unmodified uh um nucleotide uh can also

366
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,519
re

367
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,759
uh um RNA bases without having to

368
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,519
convert them necessarily to cdna so it's

369
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,759
a it's a much more

370
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,639
flexible uh readout uh the only thing

371
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,800
that one would theoretically need to do

372
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,560
in order to get it to read something

373
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,680
else is to train the the machine

374
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,639
learning base caller to recognize a

375
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:26,959
signal other than actg or or

376
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,120
you uh and uh again there are uh you

377
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,959
know clever things that nanapur does do

378
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,519
in order to take its electrical readout

379
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,720
which is again kind of a movie uh and

380
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,759
turn that into a high accuracy base

381
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,079
caller uh I think you know similar to to

382
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,079
to Pac bio there are some clever you

383
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,279
know hairpin structures and duplex

384
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,240
sequencing there are a lot of different

385
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,800
schemes there's also a huge amount of

386
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,639
innovation on the base caller side so I

387
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,959
think nanapur uh releases a new version

388
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,360
of its base callar I don't know it feels

389
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,600
like every 3 to six months uh but there

390
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,480
is constant Improv

391
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,959
in uh in the base caller there's

392
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,079
constant Improvement in their engineered

393
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,360
pores the most recent Innovation is uh

394
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,880
essentially a dual reader head pore that

395
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,679
basically generates two electrical

396
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,480
signals per uh uh per readout so you get

397
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,160
kind of redundant sequencing without the

398
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,760
circularized DNA fragment you just you

399
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,919
essentially get two uh two chances to

400
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,600
read it as it translocates through uh

401
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,360
through the

402
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,400
port um okay uh that is a that is a

403
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,880
brief recap of what I talked about last

404
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,600
time I go into more detail in the

405
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,120
previous talk so again just for a second

406
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I'll put up the slide in case anyone

407
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,600
wants to go to the previous

408
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,600
link okay hopefully that's enough

409
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,960
time uh instrument upgrad so three

410
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,480
things I want to talk about today I want

411
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,320
to talk about some of the improvements

412
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,120
that have happened with the with the

413
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,400
instruments uh methylation and targeted

414
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,559
sequencing so all

415
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,360
already like I said I was I was only

416
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,320
here a few months ago and already my

417
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,760
slides from that time are a little bit

418
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,880
out of date just in the past couple of

419
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,840
months I think ashg uh Pac bio announced

420
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,039
a a new addition to their lineup uh the

421
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,880
uh pack bio Vega uh the Vega is meant to

422
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:25,880
be a a benchtop version of their pack

423
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,240
bio reval instrument uh with you know

424
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,120
slightly lower you know low lower yield

425
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,000
uh but still able to generate um high

426
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,840
quality what Pac bio calls high-fi data

427
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,679
this error corrected data uh nanapur uh

428
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,799
has had benchtop instrument I mean all

429
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,360
of nur's Ben uh instruments are are

430
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,960
benchtop uh and I I think the last time

431
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,760
I showed the uh the the box in the back

432
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,559
that had 24 or 48 flow cells and the Box

433
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,760
on the right that had five flow cells

434
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,480
and some of the handheld ones um which

435
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,320
are very fun to play with I used to have

436
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,080
one I gave it away how great is it that

437
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,200
we live we we're at a time when I can

438
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,320
just buy a sequencer and put it in my

439
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,400
pocket uh but since then they've they've

440
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,240
come up with their with some additional

441
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,480
formats as well that are meant for um

442
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,000
individual Labs uh and and just benchtop

443
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,039
use things that uh devices that support

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,440
one or two flow cells rather than

445
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:22,640
needing to constantly feed some of the

446
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,520
the more production capable instruments

447
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,320
that take 24 or 4ot de flow cells those

448
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,799
can be hard to uh keep occupied for for

449
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,600
a long

450
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,559
time uh Pac bio has also announced some

451
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,799
improvements in their chemistry in fact

452
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,919
I think we are uh the Bro should be uh

453
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,120
getting preliminary data on this

454
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,120
probably in the next week or two so this

455
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,559
is a this is a uh a very recent

456
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,640
development a new chemistry from Pac bio

457
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:54,039
called spark um uh which Pac bio claims

458
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,120
achieves a 33% increase in yield per

459
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,320
smart cell so each smart cell at the

460
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,400
moment each Revo smart cell is expected

461
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,640
to generate somewhere between 24 and 30X

462
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,799
coverage uh and P bio is uh releasing

463
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,080
this new chemistry that they claim will

464
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,400
will uh will generate somewhere between

465
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,480
35 and 40x coverage I think the way they

466
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:20,320
think about this is 220x genomes per uh

467
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,799
per um per smart cell uh requiring less

468
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,640
DNA right previous input requirements

469
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,240
were around two micrograms now we're

470
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,080
down to half a microgram so the

471
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,840
capability of doing more precious

472
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,000
samples I know a lot of my colleagues in

473
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,200
the cancer Community really worry about

474
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,400
this number is the amount of uh DNA

475
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,039
required for pack bio sequencing is

476
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,120
substantially larger than it is for uh

477
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,120
aluminous sequencing uh

478
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,320
yes so I have an intuition of what like

479
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,640
30 30X coverage means for alumina yeah

480
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,600
in your mind do you translate that to

481
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,000
some to like alumina 30X does that mean

482
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,120
something a little bit different than

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,720
30X here given accuracy or anything I'm

484
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,080
just curious like if my interpretation

485
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,159
of what 30X means from alumina is

486
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,760
similar yeah it's so it's an excellent

487
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:24,520
question um so the the way that I think

488
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,480
about the the way that I think about

489
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,039
30X the way that I think about 30X is is

490
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,159
actually

491
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:36,039
what does it take to accurately call all

492
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,720
of the variants that you expect from a

493
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:40,960
from from a truth data

494
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,600
set uh and you you can you could do this

495
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
Cal you could do this evaluation in a

496
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,880
number of different ways I think the

497
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,080
most common way to do it is titration

498
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,880
experiment I have some data set that was

499
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,760
at very high coverage um that I'm very

500
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,400
confident in that was sequence to let's

501
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:59,360
say you know 40x 60x 80x 100x something

502
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,240
where I think that I've genuinely

503
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,320
discovered more or less everything that

504
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,400
there is to discover that is not an easy

505
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,440
experiment to do in the first place and

506
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,799
we're getting better at it with the

507
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,320
release of a you know human penum

508
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,760
reference Consortium data and things

509
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,799
like that but but then the question is

510
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,960
uh all right I'm going to se was to a

511
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,520
lower coverage how much of that data did

512
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,039
I recover now there are two there there

513
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,559
two things to to consider there one the

514
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,440
the um uh the the the capabilities of

515
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,559
the software will will will vary so for

516
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,760
example structural varying callers may

517
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,360
not be confident just seeing one or two

518
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,760
reads supporting uh a large structural

519
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,039
variant they may require three or five

520
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,240
reads uh you may also require more more

521
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,960
data for for genotyping so you can do

522
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:55,240
this as uh I'm just going to down sample

523
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:59,000
my data to 30X 15 uh 25x 20x 15x etc etc

524
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:03,039
um now the second thing to know

525
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,080
is that long read coverage is much more

526
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,080
even than short read coverage and a lot

527
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,559
of the discussion around should we have

528
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,000
20x pack bio sequencing and nanoport

529
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:18,360
sequencing versus 30X uh I think it it

530
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,559
it falls into into this

531
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,720
consideration where you require higher

532
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,559
coverage in aluminous sequencing in

533
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,520
order to shore up the parts of the

534
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,840
genome that tend to get lower coverage

535
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,840
that happens less with pack bio and

536
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,919
nanopore sequencing and so the

537
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,120
recommendation that uh we can hit I mean

538
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,480
you can see from so I'm showing a plot

539
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,400
from from Pac bio but there are actually

540
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,559
a number of different plots that look

541
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,120
pretty much exactly like this my group

542
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:51,159
has done um uh work very similar to this

543
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:54,240
that is in Broad broad agreement but the

544
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,440
idea is that uh you know we know we're

545
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,440
missing quite a few things at at 10x

546
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,000
we're missing less at 20x and the gap

547
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:07,440
between 20x and 30X is uh is not so

548
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,679
large now I want to be clear that is not

549
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,200
me suggesting that all experiments on

550
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,600
Long R instruments should be done at 20x

551
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,240
right this will obviously depend on the

552
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,120
application I'm more than happy with the

553
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,679
the 15x that we're generating for the

554
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,760
all of us project but the the goal of

555
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,679
the all of us project is not

556
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,600
necessarily comprehensive

557
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,080
uh structural variant detection down to

558
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,080
single Tins in every single sample it's

559
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,159
more to construct a uh a a resource of

560
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,440
structural variant that could be

561
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,279
utilized by other projects and seeing

562
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,960
more samples is better than seeing every

563
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,279
single variant in one sample that's not

564
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,440
necessarily true for rare disease

565
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,279
projects uh one of my one one of my new

566
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,279
colleagues is looking at um sematic

567
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,720
variation in samples that would call for

568
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,000
higher coverage so but that's that's

569
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,240
where this difference between the

570
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,919
recommendation for 30X at alumina and

571
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,360
20x for long re platforms is coming from

572
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,799
bit of a longwinded answer but I hope

573
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,600
that answers your

574
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,840
question

575
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,360
um where was I so improvements at um um

576
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,159
in PAC bios chemistry also improvements

577
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:27,320
in already this slide is out of date but

578
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:31,000
already uh additional improvements in um

579
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:34,000
uh with nanapur sequencing as well uh

580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,520
again like I said the the the two things

581
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,720
that nanapur tends to innovate on are

582
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,480
the the construction of their pore which

583
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,760
they label with an an r and uh and some

584
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
numerical identifier I think we're up to

585
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,960
R

586
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,279
10.4.1 for is their is their latest p uh

587
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,840
and Innovations in in base calling so

588
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,039
they're they're achieving somewhere

589
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,520
between 100 and 120 gigabases uh per

590
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:03,559
read uh uh per per read uh per uh per

591
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,559
flow cell on par with what we're what

592
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:10,120
we're seeing from Pac bio instruments uh

593
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,840
um P bio uh data is at the moment higher

594
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,279
quality nanopore impressively seems to

595
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,760
uh you know keep keep catching up um so

596
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,799
I'm I'm very happy to have these two

597
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,640
companies competing with each other to

598
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,480
drive their instruments uh to to greater

599
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,279
and greater Heights for for our

600
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,720
use uh I I I won't go into the duplex

601
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,360
sequencing but basically what I was

602
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,399
saying before there are a lot of

603
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,559
different Library schemes that allow you

604
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:41,679
to uh to to correct some of the uh some

605
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,120
of the errors in in the sequencing data

606
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,120
this is what I wanted to get to

607
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,679
methylation calling so last time and

608
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,600
even in this talk I I've talked uh about

609
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,440
base calling for uh pack biodata and

610
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,039
nanoport data basically that either

611
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,679
fluorescence uh readout over time or the

612
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:04,880
electrical current readout out over time

613
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:07,840
uh as allowing one to um uh to to call

614
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,240
uh a c's G's and T's directly from that

615
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,600
signal uh but there's an additional

616
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,720
feature that I alluded to which is uh or

617
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,799
additional two features that I alluded

618
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:23,120
to uh for pack bio sequencing which are

619
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,440
uh the um uh the pulse width and the

620
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,039
interpulse distance pulse width I've

621
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:34,039
labeled on on on this plot that um I've

622
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:36,720
taken from a a poster presented by uh I

623
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:40,120
think Chris saers at Pac bio uh pulse

624
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,679
width is uh just the you know the the

625
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,039
duration that you see a signal from one

626
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,840
of these nucleotides uh an interpulse

627
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,679
distance is the time until the next

628
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,720
incorp the incorporation of the next

629
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,760
base one of the interesting features

630
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,039
that's annotated on on Chris's image is

631
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,200
the uh Denine base in the in the middle

632
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,880
of this plot versus the two A's at the

633
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,960
end of the plot and you can see just the

634
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,440
amount of time it takes to uh uh to to

635
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,120
to to move from incorporating that first

636
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,279
first a uh to the t is much much larger

637
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,000
than it is for the for the for the other

638
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:20,080
two A's these three features the

639
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,600
fluoresence intensity the pulse width

640
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,039
interpulse distance uh can be uh used to

641
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,080
create a a a a set of features that's

642
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,480
fed into a neural network that is

643
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,240
trained to call uh methylation signal

644
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,039
and so we see without you know belfi

645
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,559
treatment or oxidated bisulfide

646
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,240
treatment we can see the uh the

647
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,559
methylation status of certain

648
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,120
nucleotides without having to do an

649
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,200
additional

650
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,279
experiment um oh I'll I'll I'll let me

651
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,760
skip skip that to to this nanopore

652
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,760
sequencing is is very similar uh rather

653
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,640
than the uh um measuring the width and

654
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,000
interpulse distance though they could do

655
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,720
it directly from the electrical signal

656
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,200
right if you think of each nucleotide as

657
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,320
a resistor going through um uh you know

658
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,679
this potential difference between the

659
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
you know between one end of the pore and

660
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,960
the other each nucleotide methylated or

661
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,320
unmethylated has a characteristic signal

662
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,360
sometimes that signal is not going to be

663
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,039
so different from the from the

664
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,679
unmethylated signal uh that you can that

665
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,399
the Bas caller can tell but for 5mc and

666
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:36,320
6 ma a uh it is uh you can see just the

667
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:39,200
the third position in the uh the current

668
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,600
versus position in reference plot uh a

669
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,159
difference between a you know a base and

670
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,039
a modified base that you can train the

671
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,640
base caller to

672
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:52,919
identify so the nice thing is that long

673
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,519
read data uh contains two ohms in one

674
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,600
right you have the primary genome

675
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:01,120
sequence for for for your sample um but

676
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,720
you ALS also have uh a 5mc readout for

677
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,159
for your sample without having to do any

678
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:12,279
additional uh Library treatment uh there

679
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:15,320
are comparisons uh to uh to to to um

680
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:18,000
between oxir nanopore P bio methylation

681
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,919
and either bisulfide treatment or

682
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,200
oxidative bisulfide treatment there are

683
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,519
a lot of different versions of this but

684
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,919
they all sort of come to the same

685
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,200
conclusion which is there is very high

686
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,279
correspondence between uh the alumina uh

687
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,279
bisulfite treated data sets in the PAC

688
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:36,640
bio and oxir nanopore there is a gap but

689
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,399
that Gap is due to Pac bio and nanopore

690
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,039
being able to access more parts of the

691
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,760
genome than the aluminous sequencing can

692
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,760
right because remember for bisulfide

693
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,760
treatment you're basically reducing the

694
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,360
complexity of the sequin by turning all

695
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,480
unmethylated uh cytosines into urasil

696
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,600
and then through PCR amplification into

697
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,639
thyine uh and for oxidative bisulfite

698
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,279
sequencing uh your

699
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,960
uh converting both unmethylated cytosine

700
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:10,000
and um hydroxymethylated cytosine uh

701
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,279
into uh into thyine bases uh you you

702
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,159
only have 150 bases so if you reduce the

703
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:16,480
sequence complexity of that read it's

704
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,480
harder to map those reads to to to where

705
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,639
they're supposed to go uh with the the

706
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,200
methylation readout in the long read

707
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,080
data you're still benefiting from the

708
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,039
full length of the long read data

709
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,919
without having to convert any of your

710
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,360
bases to another base in order to read

711
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,480
out the signal so there's no loss in the

712
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,120
the the actual the the sequence accuracy

713
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,960
and on top of that you get a layer of

714
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,720
information that you would have to go

715
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:46,760
out of your way to get for aluminous

716
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,760
sequencing uh oh sorry go

717
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,760
ahead about cost um

718
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,039
uh yeah I guess that's right I I mean I

719
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,720
hav't

720
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,799
so in my day job I I try very hard not

721
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,679
to think about sequencing costs because

722
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:18,679
they they change so much and it's not my

723
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:21,639
department it's not my um um

724
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,519
um is not my issue to deal with uh but

725
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,960
you're right like you you would need to

726
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,320
do two experiments um for aluminous

727
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,080
sequencing versus the one experiment

728
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,120
that you need to do here for for pack

729
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,120
bio sequencing and and for nanopore

730
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,559
sequencing uh that does you know you

731
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,679
know basically double the cost of

732
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,279
aluminous sequencing I don't know many

733
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,720
people who do necessarily do both of

734
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,039
those uh experiments the the the way I

735
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,080
think about it is it's actually kind of

736
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,200
in the other direction I think because

737
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,639
of because of the additional

738
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,720
treatment um because you require more

739
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,440
DNA you require more time s you know

740
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,760
prepping samples

741
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,760
uh increas in the cost I actually think

742
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,760
that most studies most short read

743
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,440
studies that I I've seen probably aren't

744
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,840
generating the methylation data unless

745
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,760
they absolutely need it unless they

746
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,799
really have a hypothesis here you get it

747
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,519
for free so all of a sudden there's a

748
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,639
whole bunch of analysis that you can do

749
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,200
that you might not have considered

750
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:22,840
before like for example at at at at

751
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,200
repeat expansions can I see

752
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,120
hypermethylation in the region of the

753
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,760
the repeat expansion I might not have

754
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,360
considered to look for that before but

755
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,639
now I can see it without having to do

756
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,600
any extra

757
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:39,200
work um one of the questions I'm often

758
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,080
asked about this uh is how do I get my

759
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,080
methylation data off of the instrument

760
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,639
does it come in a bed file um and the

761
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,600
answer is you don't have to do anything

762
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:52,600
it comes automatically with the w with

763
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,720
the sequence production process uh I put

764
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,480
a little Aster I should I put a little

765
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,120
asteris on that because uh nanoport this

766
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,919
is true for nanapur as well but nanapur

767
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,559
gives you a lot more control as to what

768
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:04,919
settings you use in base calling so it's

769
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,919
worth checking uh your that you've

770
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,560
enabled this setting or your sequencing

771
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,800
provider has enabled this setting for

772
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,040
nanoport data for pack biod data it's on

773
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,720
by default it doesn't come as a separate

774
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,159
file it comes embedded in the BAM file

775
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,720
that you you get so if you get the BAM

776
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,040
files that you're doing snip and indel

777
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,079
and structural variant calling on that

778
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,040
bam file has the methylation data uh

779
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,240
directly encoded in it um I I won't go

780
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,720
into details on exactly how that

781
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,119
encoding works the important thing to

782
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,800
know is uh you know two two things one

783
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,480
it's embedded in the file two most of

784
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:46,560
the tools that you will be uh using um

785
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,879
are are are adapting themselves to to

786
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,040
handle this uh signal natively igv has

787
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,320
already been updated to show methylation

788
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,119
information uh all one needs to do is

789
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,000
rightclick and and as to uh to um uh

790
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,240
show the the the methylation signal as

791
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,800
opposed to the the primary base signal

792
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:09,240
if you're writing new software then uh

793
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,960
I'll tell you that the the mm and ml tag

794
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,720
which uh respectively uh Den know base

795
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,880
modifications and the probability of

796
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,359
those base modifications is a standard

797
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,680
part of the BAM speec uh HTS jdk and hgs

798
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,599
lib have been updated to to read and

799
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,000
write those tags uh so there's a lot of

800
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,320
there's a lot of bookmark the

801
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,599
bookkeeping that you need to do in order

802
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,640
to read that signal out appropriately

803
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,200
along the the length of the read

804
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,599
sequence but a whole bunch of software

805
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,720
now exists for for for you to do that

806
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,560
pretty pretty

807
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,320
easily um okay with the time left

808
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,640
there's one other thing that I wanted to

809
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,920
to to to talk about interest I think

810
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,200
this entire time been talking about

811
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:53,040
interesting consequences of single

812
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,800
molecule sequencing uh and what kind of

813
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,920
readouts we can get that we couldn't get

814
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,599
with a luminous sequencing before

815
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,520
there's one more more that I think is

816
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,680
really interesting uh called adaptive

817
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,480
sampling so one of the problems that we

818
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,760
have with that that we've been that my

819
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,760
group has been approached with several

820
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,319
times is uh a colleague who has a Locus

821
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,560
in the genome or a few Losi in the

822
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:16,920
genome that they they they they think

823
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,480
something interesting is happening at

824
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,760
that Locus either it's a structural

825
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,400
variant or it's a denovo mutation but

826
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,640
they can't get uh enough of a of a clear

827
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,599
picture of that Locus from short read

828
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,440
sequencing at the same time it seems

829
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,440
like a waste to do long read sequencing

830
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,760
on the entire genome just to see uh a

831
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:43,119
handful of Loi uh now there's stuff you

832
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,040
can do with with pack bio sequencing

833
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,920
around targeted coverage Pac bio has a

834
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,800
number of targeted sequencing kits that

835
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,280
Target uh repeat expansions or

836
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,359
clinically relevant medical genes or the

837
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,960
HLA uh but if you just have an another

838
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,440
Locus in the genome that you're going

839
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,680
after uh you may have to do um you know

840
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,119
PCR over that Locus or some other some

841
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,520
other strategy in order to capture what

842
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:13,720
you want versus nanapur where the con

843
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,280
the the the targeted sequencing doesn't

844
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:20,160
necessarily require any Li new library

845
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:24,119
prep whatsoever instead because uh

846
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,560
nanopore sequencing is uh based on a a

847
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:30,480
PO a a a pore rather than a polymerous

848
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,319
race you can reverse the action of the

849
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,560
poor and that's a really interesting

850
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:38,280
Prospect if you're trying to Target The

851
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,960
genome and only generate reads around

852
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,839
where you're you're uh where you're

853
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,720
looking so basically the way this works

854
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:49,240
is you start sequencing some uh some

855
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:52,240
strand of DNA the base calling readout

856
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,319
is in real time so you have a chance as

857
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,079
the PO the the re is translocating

858
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:00,160
through the poe to read what the first

859
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,920
200 200 bases of that read say and if

860
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,240
those 200 bases are not uh originating

861
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,119
from some part of the genome that you

862
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,520
are interested in you could reverse

863
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,880
voltage on the pore which essentially

864
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,480
unwinds that uh that fragment of DNA

865
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,440
then you reverse it again you allow that

866
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,359
Poe to accept new new reads right you

867
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,960
think about each pore as having a sort

868
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,839
of Lifetime for the total number of

869
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,680
bases it can read well you're not

870
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,359
reading the entire read you're not

871
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,599
you're not using up all of the the

872
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,760
capability of that poor just yet so you

873
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,400
reject the read you wait until you see a

874
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,720
new read that has uh 200 bases of leader

875
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,800
sequence that you care about uh this uh

876
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,920
there are a number of different groups

877
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,839
that have worked on this uh I'm showing

878
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,440
the the the papers from uh Alexander

879
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,079
Payne uh and Matt loose I know Mike

880
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,599
shot's lab has worked on this a number

881
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,560
of different Labs have um have have uh

882
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,880
work with schemes with this basically

883
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,880
nanapur gave a a an API for control for

884
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,720
realtime control of the instrument and

885
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,640
that researchers play with what they

886
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,400
would do with it I like uh um Alex uh

887
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,319
Alexander's papers here because they

888
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,040
they they highlight a few features that

889
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:19,359
I think are really interesting first is

890
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,240
if you have uh control over individual

891
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:25,400
reads uh you can do kind of clever

892
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,079
things like uh you know Target repeat

893
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,079
expansions Target Copy number variants

894
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,800
copy uh uh Target structural variants

895
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,839
you can also barcode all of your reads

896
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,760
and only accept reads that have a

897
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,040
certain barcode let's say I have you

898
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,760
know eight samples that I'm trying to

899
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,200
get data on but I want an even coverage

900
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,359
distribution right so once I've seen

901
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,160
enough data on Barcode one I don't need

902
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:50,680
it anymore so I could just have the

903
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,520
software reject that barcode for the

904
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,200
remainder of the sequencing experiment

905
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,280
and prioritize the ports towards other

906
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,680
other reads of Interest

907
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,440
uh the

908
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,200
the you know I think there are three

909
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,160
there are three things that I I I I see

910
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,640
people do with this uh capability I

911
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,119
think are really interesting so that

912
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,599
dynamically um uh switching on and off

913
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,319
barcodes uh depending on the the the

914
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,720
coverage achieved uh targeting a

915
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:25,119
specific barcode uh so if we've seen

916
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,560
enough coverage on say a variant of

917
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,839
interest uh we don't need any more data

918
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,480
from that uh barcode and we can we can

919
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,000
again prioritize other ones uh and we

920
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,280
can just generate more coverage over

921
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,400
some locus of Interest right think if

922
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,760
you're doing an assem a genome assembly

923
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,599
and you need to close gaps in that

924
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,440
assembly I could just

925
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,160
generate uh you targeted data over those

926
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,880
gaps rather than having to do yet you

927
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,640
know a full a full other sequencing

928
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:59,319
experiment uh this capability is is best

929
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,880
when one is SE uh sequenc around 1% of

930
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:04,000
the genome or

931
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,839
less uh so we can see from uh I think

932
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,839
this is also from Alex's work so that we

933
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:13,359
can see from the uh you know from this

934
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:17,359
coverage that around 1% gives us a uh a

935
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,599
15 14 or 15 fold Improvement uh in the

936
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,720
overall coverage that we would have

937
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,240
gotten at that Locus if we had done no

938
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,960
targeting at all we had just done whole

939
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,440
genome sequencing uh this works for

940
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,640
pretty much all of the forms of nanop

941
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,760
sequencing so the from the handheld

942
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,640
instruments all the way to the

943
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,560
production instrument uh this this sort

944
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,760
of targeting is possible and I'll end

945
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,119
with the the what I think is one of the

946
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,839
most interesting applications of this is

947
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:48,000
uh going after uh Target um um uh repeat

948
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,560
expansions uh this particular repeat

949
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:56,640
expansion is on the Huntington's Locus

950
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:58,520
uh similar efforts on fmr1 and um uh and

951
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,480
and a number of other repeat expansions

952
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,760
that would be uh you know not accessible

953
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,640
with short read sequencing um I think

954
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,160
this is a really lovely

955
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,319
approach uh and only possible because

956
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,400
the nanapur instrument is is the one

957
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:16,520
instrument that is not polymerase based

958
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,079
um okay uh I want to leave time for

959
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,359
questions so I'm going to stop there but

960
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,880
before I do let me just thank the

961
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:26,240
tremendous number of people I work with

962
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,960
uh again this list is out of date uh but

963
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,240
the the

964
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,240
the the the the the people who I I I

965
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,280
work with who have contributed to this

966
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,640
uh presentation in some other in some

967
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,680
way or another uh I'm enormously

968
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,240
grateful for their for their effort and

969
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,920
and guidance uh and I appreciate all of

970
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,920
you for listening to me thank you very

971
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,920
much

972
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,000
we have a question

973
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,119
online um they asked how many targeted

974
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,599
sequences can you do in in the targeted

975
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,760
study it's a good question I mean I I

976
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,440
don't on the one hand I don't think

977
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,960
there's necessarily a practical limit

978
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,720
you know nanoport does provide barcodes

979
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,480
in uh you know a a few different

980
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:26,520
configurations I think uh you know 4816

981
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,400
up to perhaps 90 I can't remember what

982
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:33,800
they're what what their limit is um but

983
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,359
more practically speaking it there there

984
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,240
two there there two things to know one

985
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:45,559
um you can estimate the yield of a flow

986
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:48,280
cell to be uh I I generally go for I I

987
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:51,640
generally think around 90 gigabases for

988
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,440
a promethion flow cell so 90 gigabases

989
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,119
divided by the number of barcodes but it

990
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,359
turns out it's not that simple there is

991
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,359
some penalty for for using bar codes

992
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,000
there's some yield penalty that we've

993
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,359
observed for for for using uh barcodes

994
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,280
so we tend to think it's around 2 to

995
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,800
three

996
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,559
barcodes um now there'll be back and

997
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,680
forth I mean there there are constant

998
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,520
improvements in these platforms so it's

999
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,079
something that we need to check in over

1000
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,000
and over again and every time nanopore

1001
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,559
updates one of their uh pores they also

1002
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,920
need to update one of their um barcoding

1003
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:26,319
kits so there's a bit there's a bit of a

1004
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,079
lag between upgrading the poor and up uh

1005
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,400
and upgrading the the barcodes but

1006
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,079
that's that's generally how we think

1007
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,040
about it today is around two to three

1008
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,839
barcodes gets you like 30X or higher

1009
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,079
coverage over uh targets as long as

1010
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:44,160
there are less than 1% of the

1011
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:48,040
genome Aron um thank you for the talk

1012
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,640
and I have at least one question um are

1013
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,319
there um are there data sets now that

1014
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,000
are merging that are combin that are

1015
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:57,720
like with this combined methylation and

1016
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,520
sequencing data

1017
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,160
yes there are so um wait let me just

1018
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,839
clarify are you asking are there

1019
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,400
publicly available data sets that have

1020
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,680
both primary base signal and methylation

1021
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,200
Signal or are you asking are people

1022
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,520
combining pack biodata and oxer anore

1023
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,720
data because I'd have I'd be happy to

1024
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,680
answer both the the first one so like

1025
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,400
when you were talking about being able

1026
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,720
to kind of read out both from the same

1027
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,800
yes there are so publicly available data

1028
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,720
sets are available on Pac bio's website

1029
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,720
every time they've upgraded the the the

1030
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,880
in they've released uh they released a

1031
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,760
number of things they released usually

1032
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,599
HD2 but they've also released some tumor

1033
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:41,640
normal pairs um I think there are a

1034
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:45,079
couple of colorl cancer uh um uh pairs

1035
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,240
on on their on their website uh they

1036
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:49,680
have a few microbial genomes as well

1037
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,480
which for 5mc methylation might not be

1038
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,040
as interesting um uh but there are there

1039
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,880
are a bunch there so there there there

1040
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,640
are a bunch there the second place to

1041
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:02,720
look is the um um human P genome

1042
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,920
reference Consortium and and I kind of

1043
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,000
treat them together but they're separate

1044
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,200
things hprc and uh Human Genome

1045
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,880
structural variant Consortium now I will

1046
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,680
say the early data that they generated I

1047
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,720
think they stripped out the methylation

1048
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:21,880
signals so you should know that the the

1049
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,200
the the ability to call methylation on

1050
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:28,079
board the instrument is fairly new maybe

1051
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:31,000
only in the last few years uh so the

1052
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,480
initial data that that was generated by

1053
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
hbrc didn't contain that data newer data

1054
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,839
coming from hbrc I think should contain

1055
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,440
that data and all of that is publicly

1056
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,920
available it's thousand genome samples

1057
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,599
so all of that is available uh and then

1058
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,440
third um uh so it's not publicly Ava

1059
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,520
well yeah it's not publicly available

1060
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,960
yet but it will be in the

1061
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:56,079
next probably within the next month or

1062
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,480
so the What's called the the V8 release

1063
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,119
of all of us

1064
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,880
will now contain uh uh a couple thousand

1065
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,119
long read samples we had released about

1066
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,720
a thousand long read samples in V7 they

1067
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,480
didn't for the same reason I just

1068
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,520
indicated they didn't have methylation

1069
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,599
signal the new data we've been very

1070
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,480
paranoid to make sure they all have

1071
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,119
methylation signal that's the pack

1072
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,640
biodata and anopore data that's around I

1073
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,440
can't remember the exact number but it's

1074
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,839
somewhere between a th and 2,000 um

1075
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,079
genomes from uh a number of individuals

1076
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:29,119
from diverse ancestry and that will be

1077
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:32,040
available on researcher

1078
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,319
workbench uh um for anyone who wants to

1079
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,960
access

1080
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:38,760
them no problem all right I think we

1081
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,839
have time for one more online are there

1082
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,200
mature base callers for other cytosine

1083
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:47,520
derivatives EG uh 5hmc or 5fc yes there

1084
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,839
are I actually don't have a

1085
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,040
comprehensive list in my head as to

1086
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:58,480
everything that the the base caller

1087
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:01,680
supports I think it it's 5mc 5H H MC uh

1088
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,000
and 6 ma but 6 ma calling I think is

1089
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,960
usually for

1090
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,640
RNA I assume it's been updated for I I

1091
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,160
think it's probably capable for DNA as

1092
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,800
well I'm just a little bit less familiar

1093
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,599
with that literature to be able to say

1094
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,400
for for for certain uh and it can also

1095
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,640
be trained to detect uh uh different

1096
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,760
modified bases if you have such a

1097
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,520
training Set nanapur uh releases their

1098
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,440
base caller as open source and they

1099
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,640
provide documentation on how train it

1100
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,440
for new base

1101
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,599
modifications uh which is a a pretty

1102
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,440
exciting thing to consider for a number

1103
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:40,000
of RNA sequencing applications and uh

1104
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,839
and other synthetic biology

1105
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,599
applications great and then there's a

1106
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,400
few more questions online but we're out

1107
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,000
of time so if anyone can email Karen

1108
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,760
with additional questions I'm sure he'd

1109
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,559
be happy to answer absolutely thank you

1110
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,559
see you after the new year
