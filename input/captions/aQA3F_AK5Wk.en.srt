00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
living in the world you must have

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,960
concern for the future if you care about

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,359
it and I think if you want to predict

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,000
the future and want to know if it's

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,400
going to be positive or negative the

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,400
best way to do it is to shape it so I

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,000
think my biggest concern would be making

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,960
sure there's responsible use of certain

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,720
Technologies I'd say AI is a huge

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,080
concern for me I think it's only as good

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,960
as the programmer it's only as good as

12
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,080
the user it's only as good as the prompt

13
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,080
and I think what I'm really concerned

14
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,920
about is how Schools traditional

15
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,160
schooling private schooling goes about

16
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,199
teaching students about this new

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,079
technology for more MIT moments from MIT
