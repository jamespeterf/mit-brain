1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,560
so I'd like to now introduce our first

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,000
company sciteex citec AI powered patent

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,440
platform solution it provides smart

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,799
cities with a full spectrum cyber

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,160
security and presenting for sciteex is

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,600
CEO and co-founder Andrew sillo Andrew

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,680
was CEO and founder of omni Channel cpg

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,199
company Atlantic Coast Brands and

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,720
co-founded marante systems Andrew is a

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,960
lecturer in Innovation and Technology at

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,640
mit's operations Research Center welcome

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,040
Andrew

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,600
well thank you Trisha it's great to be

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,399
here um I'm I'm glad to be included

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,760
because uh any planning for smart cities

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,000
certainly needs to contemplate cyber

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,440
security um if we think back to um the T

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
the sidewalk Toronto program which

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,960
failed back in 2018 it didn't fail

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,960
because of funding it failed be because

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,399
there was a lack of trust uh between the

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,960
citizens whether or not the city would

23
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,000
be able to safeguard their data so if we

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,640
think about uh the vulnerability and the

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,920
challenges face uh Smart City Planning

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,360
and just urban planning generally um

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,240
there is a the threat surface has

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,439
increased exponentially with iot devices

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,840
connected partner multiple Network

30
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:19,040
systems uh utilities uh partners and so

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,920
forth has increased the the threat

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,720
surface uh exponentially and so uh we

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,439
need to ensure that there is a a

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,479
coherent and cohesive cyber security

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,520
plan uh to safeguard

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,159
uh the city's data and uh and the

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,600
citizens as well so we've taken a system

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,399
engineered approach to cyber security so

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,119
we cover everything from the from device

40
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,200
to Cloud connected Partners um and also

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,360
uh from a compliance perspective uh

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,399
actually oversite as well so real time

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,439
everything that we do needs to have

44
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:56,439
realtime monitoring um to ensure that

45
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,399
there is this no now uh no now uh um

46
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,479
visibility into what's happening across

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,600
the Enterprise or across the city

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,479
so this includes network security Cloud

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,320
Security app security Dev SEC Ops

50
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,319
compliance certainly uh one of our

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,319
recommendations is that every every city

52
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,760
should require their connected partners

53
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,879
and their uh departments to comply with

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,319
some kind of framework uh and then we

55
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,959
actually provide the facilities through

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,040
which you can actually monitor that so

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,599
what does this mean so uh we've taken a

58
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,720
data-driven approach to cyber risk uh

59
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,920
and GRC so from one central location

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,319
uh we've taken a lot of the mystery or

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,680
the confusion out of multiple

62
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,440
applications and multiple vendors to

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
consolidate a view into one place so you

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,319
actually know exactly what's happening

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,400
on the network what's on devices through

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,640
connected Partners uh which means

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,360
continuous uh monitoring of your

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,480
connected Partners public facing um uh

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:00,360
assets um and also empowering uh our our

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,760
partners with an AI powered um uh

71
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,480
security co-pilot and we call our

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,040
co-pilot Leo um Leo's been trained on

73
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,799
six different personas everything from

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,000
SE level executive uh threat andt

75
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:16,239
analyst compliance manager um and ceso

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,640
so this is an example of how it works um

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,519
you can see the person the personas here

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,440
will select ciso in this instance all

79
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,440
the risks then are aggregated here and I

80
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,879
can select one let's say ensure Hardware

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,640
MFA is enabled um then Leo will will

82
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
return several prompts

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,000
uh what would you like me to do write a

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,319
synopsis write a poem generate a summary

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,959
we'll say write a synopsis Leo goes to

86
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,680
work and then returns a result in

87
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,959
language and with information that's to

88
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,920
that role of ciso right so what is the

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,200
mitigation what's the prevention

90
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,319
probability of happening uh technical

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,640
references and so forth but then taking

92
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,760
that a step further not just the Lang

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,319
not natural language prompt but also

94
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,400
let's say write the remediation code so

95
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,840
this becomes a real Force multiple

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,120
so Leo evaluating the environment and

97
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,560
the risk comes back with the specific

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,720
bash code here uh bash script rather um

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,599
with instructions so that uh the the

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,680
Enterprise is much more efficient and

101
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,000
we're solving problems in real

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,519
time we've also taken this a step

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,960
further because one of the um challenges

104
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,680
of any framework is the lack of real

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,639
time monitoring um so one of our uh one

106
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,639
of our inventions is is a um a solution

107
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,840
we call aify aify actually allows for

108
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,960
the real time from a governance

109
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,720
perspective so at the city level you

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,080
could actually um query in real time

111
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,120
through a multi-tenant interface the

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,320
actual disposition uh for the framework

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,520
down to the control level at your your

114
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,160
connected partner so for instance if

115
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,199
you're the uh uh city manager and you

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,000
have a vendor um you could run a script

117
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
that that then PS back and shows you

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,639
exactly where are with maybe a smart

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,840
cities framework or uh ISO or uh the

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,320
various n Frameworks as

121
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,680
well here's a a a great uh case study um

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,919
anonymized to protect the innocent um

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,320
but this is a a major uh City watery

124
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,280
Authority the challenge that they had is

125
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,000
uh again you're you're trying to monitor

126
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,759
multiple systems multiple networks uh

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,120
across a wide Geographic as well as uh

128
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,000
digital landscape so the solution was

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,520
really to take aifi and our platform

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,560
approach um to give real-time visibility

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,120
um and monitoring down to the uh device

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
level uh networks uh and so forth so you

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,479
can actually know in real time if there

134
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,319
is a risk vulnerability uh or if there's

135
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,600
a deficiency and then take action to

136
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,919
remediate that so um if you want a

137
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
future proof uh a smart city if you're

138
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,400
thinking about Smart City technology

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,000
which I think everyone is um the public

140
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,680
trust is something that we have to be

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,720
very conscious of so we provide full

142
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,360
Spectrum insights um no now visibility

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,479
and real-time monitoring um across uh

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,000
Enterprises and also through covered

145
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,000
entities which would be connected

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,840
partners and so forth so with that um

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,520
love to open it up for for any questions

148
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,479
I try to get through this quickly out of

149
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,759
respect for everyone's

150
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,360
time thank you

151
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,720
Andrew now we have a few questions that

152
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,039
we'll dive into so could

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,080
you describe a little bit how city

154
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,360
planners can work with citex to

155
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,319
implement the smart City's compliance

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,400
framework sure so that's a great

157
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,599
question the first thing we start with

158
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,080
is a risk assessment we take a

159
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,880
risk-based approach right so um I think

160
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,440
everyone uh we've never gone into a risk

161
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,360
assessment where we didn't uncover

162
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,400
deficiencies that weren't known and

163
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,680
that's really because of the uh the

164
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,360
nature by which we solve for cyber today

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
which is multiple

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,520
applications um I think the average

167
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,639
average company has 26 applications so

168
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,960
we start there so we do a a risk

169
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,039
assessment um we can partner with the

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,479
the city and do that and then identify

171
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,240
really priority wise where do we start

172
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,560
um I I I will say that we've never not

173
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,960
saved money for a client um by virtue of

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,919
the fact that uh it with this cohesive

175
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,720
solution we're able to eliminate maybe

176
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,720
some redundancies that we're paying for

177
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,599
already um so uh they can reach out to

178
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,360
me directly uh we also have a

179
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,759
partnership with MIT cyber defense

180
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Clinic um as well as um some other

181
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,919
universities as well so uh e either

182
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,400
through us directly or through one of

183
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,479
our University Partners excellent

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,759
fantastic I think we have time for one

185
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,360
more so here's a question we already

186
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,680
have a cyber security Tech stack and

187
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,599
cyber team can citec complement our

188
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,680
existing stack and if so is there a

189
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:52,000
little detail you can share around that

190
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,479
100% And I think that's where uh the I

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
think intelligent use of artificial

192
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,000
intelligence specifically with Leo our

193
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,000
our AI co-pilot um we're going to be see

194
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,800
the we're going to start seeing kind of

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,440
uh a generification of of of uh of of AI

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,360
coming here and I think that's going to

197
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:13,000
create additional vulnerabilities so um

198
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,520
sensible Sensible uh deployment of

199
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,120
artificial intelligence is something

200
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,280
that we can help with number two um we

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,919
are a force multiplier the the fact that

202
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,840
we have over a 100 Integrations with uh

203
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,759
pre-built Integrations with all of the

204
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,240
name brands that you're familiar with so

205
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,479
we play nicely with others um and our

206
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,719
average implementation is is very short

207
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,440
seamless fantastic well thank you again

208
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,200
Andrew and and thanks to sciteex for

209
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,200
joining us here today thank you Trisha
