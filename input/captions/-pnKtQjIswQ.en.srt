00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
Hello and welcome to Today I Learned

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,280
Climate brought to you by the

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,040
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,719
I'm L Hessie

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,359
Fischer. Where are you listening to this

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,600
episode from today? Maybe you're riding

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,680
the bus on your morning commute or

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,560
taking a leisurely stroll through the

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,439
park. But chances are if you look around

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,359
you, you'll see four walls, maybe a door

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,040
or two, some windows because you're in a

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,960
building. And we Americans, we spend

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,719
close to 90% of our time indoors in the

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,760
offices, stores, and factories where we

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
work, the gyms, and shops and theaters,

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,480
and the homes where we relax at the end

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,200
of the day. But how often do we really

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,160
notice these spaces and how they're

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,120
built and why they're built that way?

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,000
The built environment has been the

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,680
shelter that humans needed throughout

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,199
history. Whether it was cavelike

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,600
structures, indigenous buildings that

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,760
survive until today, creating

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,640
comfortable spaces that are also

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,720
shelters from the environment. That's

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,960
Terra Craka. I am associate professor at

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,520
Georgia Tech and director of the high

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
performance building lab and program at

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,759
the school of architecture in the

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,560
college of design. He also got his PhD

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,680
here at MIT where he worked in the MIT

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,560
sustainable design lab. And as professor

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,759
Raka says the first thing to know about

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,759
a building is that it's shelter. It

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,400
shields us from the rain and the wind

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,280
and the cold. And the way we build has

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,079
always reflected that. Climate

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,720
resiliency has been at the forefront of

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,520
architectural practices since we have

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,240
started building as humanity using the

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,119
materials from the environment we're in

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,920
and then shaping our architecture to be

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,880
responsive to the environment. Think for

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,920
example of the adobe houses of desert

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
regions like in the American Southwest.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,319
The native Pueblo people built their

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,200
homes out of the clay in the area and

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,160
those clay walls absorbed the hot desert

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,520
heat, keeping their inhabitants cool

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,760
during the day and warm at

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,599
night. And as technology developed, we

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,160
found that we could do more than just

54
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,040
shield ourselves from the weather. We

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,120
could actually engineer our buildings so

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
that we're perfectly comfortable all

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
throughout the day and all throughout

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,280
the year. It is really a beautiful

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,920
experience if you get a breeze on a

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,160
beach. We want to strive for these kind

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,640
of experiences in our buildings and

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,599
therefore we've invented HVAC. So,

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,280
heating, ventilation, and air

64
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:54,400
conditioning. Look around for me again.

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Can you see a fan spinning away or hear

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,239
a hum of an air conditioner or a rumble

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,640
of a furnace? Our modern buildings work

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,840
very hard to keep our indoor weather

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,560
precisely the way we want it.

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,599
And that is an energy hog. The energy

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
you need to cool and heat a building is

72
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,280
significant.

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,040
A modern building is far more than just

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,480
a shelter. It's more complex and it's

75
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,640
busier. We can think of these buildings

76
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,360
as machines. Machines that turn energy

77
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,440
into comfort. So where we're going to

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
get that energy becomes very important.

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,680
Of course, historically speaking, we've

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,400
relied on fossil fuels. that is coal,

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,599
oil, and gas. Like, does your home have

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,519
gas heat? If so, your utility is pumping

83
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,760
natural gas through pipelines in your

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,319
neighborhood and into your house. Your

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,159
furnace burns that gas, creating the

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,040
heat that keeps you snug on a cold

87
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,040
winter night. Unfortunately, like all

88
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,720
fossil fuels, it also creates carbon

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,720
dioxide, part of the ever thickening

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,000
blanket of carbon pollution that is

91
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,720
heating our planet. Now, think of all of

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,159
the furnaces in all of the buildings in

93
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,560
the entire world and all of the coal and

94
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,200
gas power plants supplying those

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,200
buildings with electricity.

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,440
Buildings account for 40% of carbon

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,560
emissions globally. The amount of energy

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,960
that we use to sustain our lives in

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
buildings is substantial.

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,320
Which brings us to yet another way to

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,199
look at modern buildings as giant pumps

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,280
for carbon. Working overtime and all

103
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,680
their many roundabout ways to take

104
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,199
fossil carbon out of the ground and pipe

105
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,680
it into the air. Buildings contribute

106
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,040
more to that carbon blanket around our

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,080
planet than heavy industry does. More

108
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,120
than growing the world's food, more even

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,680
than cars and trucks and airplanes.

110
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,840
So, is it possible to keep using our

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
buildings as the miraculous comfort

112
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,759
machines that they are, but to stop

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,680
using them as carbon

114
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,520
pumps? Well, there are buildings around

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,080
the world that are already leading the

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
way. For example, have you ever seen a

117
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,919
plaque on the side of a building that

118
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,720
proclaims that it's lead gold or lead

119
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,639
platinum? That's a certification which

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
the US Green Building Council has been

121
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
giving to energy efficient buildings

122
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,520
since the 1990s.

123
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,840
LEAD started at a time where this kind

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,560
of benchmarking was not mainstream and

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,960
the focus was not on the climate message

126
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
or the sustainability message. It was

127
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,000
all about the money that you will be

128
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,960
saving and the prestige of having the

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,280
Cadillac of buildings. Yeah. The great

130
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,720
news about lowcarbon buildings is that

131
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,720
owning one can be a big moneysaver. One

132
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,600
of the biggest misconceptions that

133
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,160
people have about sustainable and energy

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,560
efficient buildings is that they are

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
very expensive. Buildings that are

136
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,600
sustainable are typically much cheaper

137
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
than regular buildings because you know

138
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,199
what? You are not going to be using

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,440
energy in HVAC and heating and cooling.

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,840
If there's anything that you should be

141
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,080
knowing about sustainable buildings is

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,319
that there is an upfront cost that is

143
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,759
going to pay for itself over 5 to 10

144
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,880
years. So how would we create an

145
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,199
energyefficient money-saving building

146
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,360
with the fancy plaque? Well, to answer

147
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,840
that question, we have to start before

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,800
we even dig the foundation. We have to

149
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,680
start with the blueprints themselves.

150
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,759
If we're starting to design a new

151
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,160
building, we have to get the geometry

152
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,199
right first. The relationship to the

153
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,600
sun, the prevailing winds, the

154
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,800
landscaping, the correct orientation to

155
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,600
maximize solar energy and access to

156
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,319
light. Then we have to be focusing on

157
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,240
passive systems. Passive systems are

158
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,400
systems that do not use energy that

159
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
comes from fuel. So, for example,

160
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,880
glazing that allows for the sun to warm

161
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
up the space and the shading system that

162
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,680
blocks it in the summer. Like the

163
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,080
ancient Pueblo's adobe structures, our

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,120
new lowcarbon building is laid out to

165
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,400
take maximum advantage of nature itself.

166
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,720
If you're in a climate where you really

167
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,800
need to heat and retain the heat in,

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,599
there's no way around building highly

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,240
insulated buildings. And so the choice

170
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,639
of the exterior materials whether it's

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,840
going to be uh brick, concrete, fully

172
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,759
glazed facade etc. really matters not

173
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
just for the energy efficiency but also

174
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,240
for how comfortable the environment

175
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,479
would be within the interior spaces. Our

176
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,520
choice of materials matters for another

177
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,759
reason too. If you can see a steel beam

178
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,360
where you're sitting or a brick wall, if

179
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,080
you're in a building with a concrete

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,840
foundation or aluminum siding, these are

181
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,680
energyhungry materials and the building

182
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,400
industry uses a lot of them. In fact,

183
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,039
there are estimates that about 25% of

184
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,280
the carbon pollution from buildings

185
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,360
comes just from manufacturing and

186
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,120
construction.

187
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
Today, thanks to top-of-the-line

188
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
buildings like the ones that we're

189
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,240
imagining, there is a growing market for

190
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,440
cleaner materials. Whether that's local

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,560
earth and stone or engineered wood or

192
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,960
ingenious new ways of making lowcarbon

193
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,879
concrete and

194
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,280
steel, we also have excellent tools to

195
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,680
deal with the other 75% of our

196
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,320
building's carbon. This is the energy

197
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
that we use on a day-to-day basis. All

198
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,240
of the energy that is used in heating,

199
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,360
uh, cooling, lighting, equipment,

200
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,000
appliances, etc., all of these use up

201
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,240
energy. Yeah. Like remember that gas

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,640
burning furnace that we talked about?

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,800
The same work can be done by an electric

204
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,120
heat pump and which is kind of like a

205
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
reverse air conditioner. They are so

206
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
much more efficient than furnaces that

207
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
they typically cut our carbon pollution

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,000
by more than half while still keeping

209
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,240
our buildings nice and toasty. And if we

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,200
get that electricity from low polluting

211
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,680
sources like solar, wind, nuclear, and

212
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,800
others, we could heat our building with

213
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,360
almost no impact on the climate at all.

214
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,160
Our buildings might even make that clean

215
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,080
energy themselves, like through rooftop

216
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
solar

217
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,399
panels. Because if we get it right, we

218
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,320
can build buildings that rely on their

219
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,680
own energy and don't need anything from

220
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,959
the grid. There are such things as zero

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,320
energy buildings that are so energy

222
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,279
efficient that with just solar you can

223
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,120
get the energy to

224
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:46,000
zero. The highest performing buildings

225
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,519
today have designations like lead

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,320
platinum or a living building or passive

227
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,000
house and they are already delivering

228
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,600
modern comfort without the pollution.

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,399
The challenge of course is getting every

230
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,120
building to that level and it's a

231
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,600
substantial challenge. If we are to

232
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,160
build all of our new construction

233
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,000
to exceptional standards that would have

234
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,399
a clear impact.

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,959
However, more than 50% of the built

236
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,600
environment in the United States was

237
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,120
built before the year 1980. And

238
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
therefore we really have to be

239
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
considering how to retrofit existing

240
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,519
buildings because the opportunity to

241
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
build new buildings in urban settings is

242
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,880
actually very limited.

243
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,800
Okay. So I live in a home built around

244
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,880
1905 and gradually over the years my

245
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,560
family has worked to make this house

246
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,640
operate like the buildings that we've

247
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,240
been talking about. And so we followed

248
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
the textbook of what to do when

249
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,120
retrofitting an old building. So, we

250
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,240
added insulation to the outside walls

251
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,600
and flooring and replaced some leaky

252
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,279
windows. We also did some pretty cheap

253
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,640
but effective fixes called

254
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,200
weatherization. Weatherization in the

255
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,880
context of limited resources become

256
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,399
really impactful. So, weatherization

257
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360
would be, for example, using weather

258
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,200
stripping around the window frame. This

259
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
is important because you're no longer

260
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
losing energy to the environment. And

261
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,519
with that all done, an old building like

262
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,040
ours can be ready for the newest, most

263
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,880
energyefficient electrical appliances

264
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,760
like heat pumps and electric water

265
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,680
heaters, which is what we have. And over

266
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,480
time, we have found that our energy

267
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,200
bills are much lower and our house is

268
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,680
much more comfortable. Like I don't wake

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,600
up on winter mornings clinging to my

270
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,000
blankets anymore.

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,480
And yes, because we are nerds and we

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,680
track this kind of stuff, we've also

273
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,160
calculated that our home emits much less

274
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,920
pollution than it did before. Now, I

275
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,720
want to be clear, this took us a few

276
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,880
years and we invested money into it and

277
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
we were

278
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,279
motivated. But how do you motivate the

279
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
owners of the millions upon millions of

280
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,320
buildings that exist out there today or

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,000
that are about to be built? Because even

282
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,320
though high performing buildings are

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,680
possible and cost-effective and are

284
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,880
being built today, most buildings are

285
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,920
not being built to that standard. It has

286
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,880
become more mainstream. Yes. But

287
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,040
unfortunately mainly for those who are

288
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,760
building in an urban environment as well

289
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,160
as larger scale buildings. those who are

290
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,800
building for example single family homes

291
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,040
in rural settings or uh suburban

292
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
settings it's not there yet even though

293
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,279
it constitutes a significant portion of

294
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,160
the built environment. Yeah. Most

295
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,320
buildings are built to code meaning that

296
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,720
they meet the minimum energy standards

297
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,839
that the local law requires. They're not

298
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,040
aiming to be high-erforming buildings.

299
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,959
And it's worth asking, how can more

300
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,720
buildings be built

301
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:01,200
better? The most climate smart buildings

302
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,200
are also the most comfortable and the

303
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,920
cheapest to heat and cool in the long

304
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,880
run. The materials and the knowhow

305
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,480
exist. And with each new developer who

306
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,720
makes the choice to build a

307
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,600
high-erforming building, the markets

308
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,160
shift a little, opening up the labor and

309
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,480
the materials and the knowledge and the

310
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,399
expectations that buildings are built

311
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,079
this way. We know now about the built

312
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,519
environment more than we've ever known

313
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,000
in any point of history. We have these

314
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,720
sensors that are allowing us to measure

315
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,279
at the circuit level of a refrigerator

316
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,959
at the time span of a second to allow us

317
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,360
to make realtime decisions for energy

318
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:48,399
efficiency. All we need to do is

319
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,720
activate it like tap into it, have it as

320
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,480
a mindset. And that is basically my

321
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,959
advice. If there's going to be decisions

322
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,279
on building new or upgrading buildings,

323
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,440
we can't really build the same way we've

324
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,920
built 20 years ago, we have to be

325
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,070
thinking about building more sustainably

326
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,199
and keeping carbon emissions as low as
