1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,240
um hello everyone um it's great to be

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:11,280
here so my name is Ashish Kapur I did

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,240
did my PhD at MIT in 2006 um since then

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,480
I have spent 17 years at Microsoft

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,800
research and then uh took my research

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,640
group out to found scaled

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,400
foundations um you know we are a group

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,080
of very passionate robotic roboticist

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,320
some of them you know very very um

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
accomplished machine learning and AI

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,840
engineers and u over the course of last

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:38,239
decade or so we have founded some

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,680
foundational Technologies um in robotics

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,200
at the intersection of deep machine

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,480
learning large language models and uh

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,960
and robots so the specifically our

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,160
insight has been is every single robot

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,399
AI startup right now is struggling

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,640
because of lack of expertise lack of

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,280
infrastructure and in general

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,680
fragmentation of the robotic tooling you

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,120
know everyone is waiting for this Chad

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,600
GPT moment of Robotics and what we have

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
realized and after working almost a

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,920
decade in this field is that first we

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,360
need pyo equalent of Robotics so

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,360
consequently what we bring to the market

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,040
is a system called grid which stands for

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,560
General robot intelligence development

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,640
platforms essentially it is every robots

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,880
AI team if you go and look at any

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,560
Enterprises academic groups startups you

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,439
know government Labs behind behind every

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,880
single robot that's operational there is

35
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,399
a team of AI scientists researchers and

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,200
developers that is trying to make it

37
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,799
work and in fact it should be the

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,399
opposite so what we figured out that you

39
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,759
actually need an infrastructure that can

40
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,840
um that can replace and account for all

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,079
of this manual work that's going after

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,240
uh you know manual work that's going in

43
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,039
to build these robotic infrastructures

44
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,159
so specifically what grid is grid is

45
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,680
your collection of AI models simulation

46
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,000
data generation pipelines Cloud

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,360
infrastructures as well as Edge

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,200
deployment infrastructure so that you

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,200
can run as fast as possible as an

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Enterprise to go and land robot AI I

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,239
will give you a very specific example um

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,440
you know recently there have been many

53
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,640
many startups that have raised hundreds

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,519
and hundreds of millions of dollars they

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,519
are spending essentially 18 months to 24

56
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,400
months 18 18 to 24 months just to go and

57
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,680
build this infrastructure that now we

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,239
are bring to the market for every

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,280
aspiring robot AI Enterprise I will you

60
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,239
know show a couple of customer studies

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,680
so specifically Royal Dutch Shell you

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,360
know they have more than 50 Robot use

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,400
cases that they need to deploy on their

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,120
infrastructure including oil and energy

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,000
gas pipelines um you know it's it's a

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,920
small team of 10 roboticist which is uh

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
scattered throughout the world and there

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,440
is no way they can go and accomplish the

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,000
these many robot robot tasks so when

70
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,959
they saw grid they were immediately sold

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,239
and basically they were able to land

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,840
many of these proof of Concepts the

73
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,280
initial prototypes of their robotic

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,959
tasks within a few months as opposed to

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,480
many many years that they have been you

76
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
know they have been trying to land those

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,480
things in similarly another another

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,840
example is rain. Arrow is a startup that

79
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,599
we work with in California and they are

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,640
trying to do autonomous

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,000
firefighting um you know when we spoke

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,159
to them they are a well capitalized

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,959
company but they AI team the AI robotics

84
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,360
team is only two people and between them

85
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,000
one of them was trying to scavenge AI

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,480
model from hug and face another was

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,360
trying to bootstrap off uh you know

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,560
gazebo simulator you know between those

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,280
two they were really really stretch thin

90
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,519
again enter grid as soon as grid was

91
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,400
there you know their acceleration in

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,200
terms of Landing autonomy in terms of

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,879
developing AI for robots just just was

94
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,439
um um you know immen

95
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,159
so in essence what grid is it's every

96
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,799
robots AI engineering team you know my

97
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,680
ask to all of you is that if you know of

98
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,360
groups Enterprises startups you know

99
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,519
research teams that are struggling with

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,519
Landing AI on robots please connect them

101
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,280
to me I do believe that we can help them

102
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,240
run faster in the end you know the

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,199
problem with robotics is is not that um

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,039
you know it's a hard problem the problem

105
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,080
with robotics really is that the tooling

106
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:35,199
is really fragmented and they are not

107
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,199
enough experts right now to land this uh

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,759
you know as fast as we want right with

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,680
that I'll conclude thank you very much

110
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,600
thank you Ashish so touching on that um

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,919
on how Enterprises can run faster can

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,880
you tell us a little more about that and

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:55,400
how your technology actually works

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,479
absolutely so um grid is a collection of

115
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,080
softwares that we distribute as

116
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,320
containers so as a robot Enterprise if

117
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,880
you have inuring team who have already

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,120
built some infrastructure we can

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,520
interface with them very straight very

120
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,440
straightforward manners in in using

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,440
cloud apis and with those apis you get

122
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,120
the power of you know pre-trained as

123
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,280
well as um you know uh fine-tunable AI

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,360
models for your use cases in robotics be

125
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,680
It Slam be it object detection be it

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,960
computer vision be it control we can

127
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,520
pretty much uh take take care of all of

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,400
those and what other areas in robotics

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,160
are you focusing on yeah so we have a c

130
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,840
you know our strength was aerial robots

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,199
that's where was uh you know where we

132
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,840
started but since then last week we we

133
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,479
announced integration with uh with uh

134
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,520
Nvidia Isaac so now we are also going

135
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,960
into humanoids manipulation arms as well

136
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,840
as uh quadrupeds so we do are covering a

137
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,560
wide spectrum of of of robots of course

138
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,120
our biggest strength and Leadership is

139
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,680
in aial

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,680
robots thank you very much aish thanks
