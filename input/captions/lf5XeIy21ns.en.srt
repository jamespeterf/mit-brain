1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,440
okay good afternoon

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,439
so what have we done so

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:30,160
far what is thermodynamics about

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,880
remember you told us that uh it's about

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:38,920
heat and

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:41,760
work but uh to date we haven't def find

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,160
heat yet nor we spoke about work

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,160
although indirectly with the wave

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,440
processes but

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,879
uh we we have done four hours and we'll

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,160
do another two

12
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,600
today without talking about heat

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,360
not saying that thermodynamics is not

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:11,159
about heat it is also about

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,320
heat but you can go a long way without

16
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,720
and before

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,720
defining uh the heat interaction which

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,040
will be um the topic of next uh lecture

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,040
on

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,840
Friday so how could we go that long all

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:37,280
right we just review briefly what we've

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:42,520
done we Define few words like system

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:47,079
property State uh what we mean by law uh

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:51,399
or principle uh which is in fact a

25
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,840
theorem of uh the equation of motion on

26
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,640
your

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,759
model

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:04,479
um then we introduced the first law

29
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,079
which is a statement of

30
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,000
existence or actually the first

31
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:14,720
assertion is a statement of existence of

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,720
certain class of processes namely those

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,080
that allow you to interconnect any two

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:25,319
states of any system and remember we

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,280
mean the well- defined system separable

36
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,720
in the sense that we have made very

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,400
explicit

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,480
the second

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,280
assertion allows you allows us to

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:43,280
introduce a a property a general

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:48,400
property for any of these systems um and

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:52,000
for any of its state by uh supporting

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
the measurement

44
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,239
procedure that implies uh finding a

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,400
weight

46
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,239
process that goes

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,920
uh that

48
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,120
interconnects two states that way you uh

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,280
can

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,200
measure the energy difference between

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,599
those two states and uh that is um what

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,440
uh defines the property

53
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,120
energy and then this property can be

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,280
proved to be uh

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,159
additive to

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
be transferable between systems as a

57
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,760
result of

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,760
interactions and

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,720
uh also to be

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,280
conserned which takes us to the idea of

61
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,080
making a balance of this property

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,439
checking in a given

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,599
process uh that the change in the value

64
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,480
of the of the energy uh so the

65
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,840
difference between the final and the

66
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,000
initial energy that's to change in

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,000
energy

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,079
be equal to the uh energy that has been

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,040
exchanged during this uh

70
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,200
process with uh between the system and

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,159
the

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,159
environment positive if

73
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,320
receive okay and this is of course the

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,400
hinge of uh the solution of many

75
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,160
problems uh that you have certainly seen

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,120
in the undergraduate or previous

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:36,680
graduate courses on thermodynamics so I

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,720
rely upon your experience here uh

79
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,880
because this is as you know it's not of

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,520
course about application or problem

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
solving I assume that that you have some

82
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,720
experience on that because the more

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:56,160
experience you have uh the more you will

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:05:00,320
your intuition and your um uh sense of

85
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,320
um of of things will allow you to

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,400
uh pick up the meaning of the underlying

87
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,160
uh uh Theory and assumptions that you

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,199
were actually making when you perform

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,199
for example an energy

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,919
balance then we move on to the second

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,880
law also the second law is done uh

92
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:29,080
is is made up of two assertions one is a

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
statement of existence again but now

94
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,360
this time it's the existence of the

95
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,080
stable equilibrium states of a

96
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,080
system and

97
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,680
um

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,639
that um by itself together with

99
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,000
the definition of stable equilibrium

100
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,080
State remember it's a state that cannot

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,280
be changed without leaving

102
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,319
some external effect to your uh so in in

103
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,440
the environment of your system so if you

104
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,160
if your system is in a stable

105
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,599
equilibrium state in order to change it

106
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,199
to another state you have to spend

107
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,360
something you have to uh leave some net

108
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,960
uh effect in the

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,680
environment otherwise it is impossible

110
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,240
and this

111
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
impossibility U is what uh

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,520
we allows us to prove the um

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,319
impossibility of Perpetual MO machine of

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,800
the second kind which is the Kelvin

115
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:40,080
plank statement of the second

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,319
law the second

117
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,039
assertion supports the

118
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,479
definition of a property that now we

119
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,800
know because we defined it the last time

120
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:56,919
is H

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:00,479
entropy so it uh shes uh that uh it it

122
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,479
says well you you can all

123
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,479
always

124
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,879
um make a weight a reversable weight

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,599
process which takes your system from any

126
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,400
state it is to a stable equilibrium

127
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,319
state but not only stable equilibrium

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,520
State a stable equilibrium

129
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:24,400
State um that for example could be in

130
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,560
mutual equilibrium with your Reservoir

131
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,280
so in this picture I jumped to this uh

132
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,440
conclusion

133
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:38,440
uh that we have used and proved

134
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:43,400
um as a consequence ofer two of the

135
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:47,319
second law and that we used as a means

136
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,919
to define the measurement

137
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,680
procedures

138
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,000
for a property that we call temperature

139
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,000
of a

140
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,400
reservoir I'm not going to repeat that

141
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,960
but as you have seen in the first

142
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,800
homework set I am asking you to repeat

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:15,680
it uh in a short uh

144
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:19,000
video and uh we used that same um

145
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,400
process reversible weight

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,879
process uh between the system and the

147
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,440
reservoir in order to

148
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:30,560
measure the property

149
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:35,719
entropy which is

150
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:39,200
defined by this ratio it's the the ratio

151
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:43,080
between the change in energy of the

152
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:47,120
reservoir that occurs when you manage to

153
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,519
make this reversible weight

154
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,040
process that

155
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,160
interconnects in which your system goes

156
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,040
between the two states for which you

157
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,600
want to measure the enthropy

158
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,800
difference divided by

159
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,560
the temperature of the reservoir which

160
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,480
was defined by the previous uh

161
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,880
measurement procedure this

162
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,480
ratio turns out to

163
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,760
me

164
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,959
independent on the reservoir that you

165
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,519
have Cho that you have chosen and used

166
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:25,600
as therefore just an auxiliary system

167
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,959
uh auxiliary to this measurement

168
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,320
procedure but the result is independent

169
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,360
of that system

170
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,560
therefore it is a property of just

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,959
system a something that depends on your

172
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,640
system

173
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,640
a that we call the

174
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,560
an we

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,320
also in Define uh a property called

176
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,440
available

177
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,360
energy with

178
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,320
respect to a reservoir it is an addicted

179
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,040
property it can be expressed in terms of

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,519
energy and

181
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,800
entropy and it allows us to give an

182
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:14,920
engineering interpretation of entropy as

183
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:19,360
being um apart from a constant value

184
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,519
which is this group here is

185
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,200
proportional through the inverse of

186
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,519
temperature of the reservoir to the

187
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,040
energy that is not

188
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:33,120
available uh so it's not transer able to

189
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,480
a weight in a weight process for the

190
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,320
system when in combination with the

191
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,160
Reser that

192
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,920
temperature so

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,920
entropy has the non available uh

194
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,279
energy and it is additive the additivity

195
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,720
remember we also had another property

196
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,160
which is adiabatic

197
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,079
availability which contain much of the

198
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,160
information much of the value in terms

199
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:12,880
of um what's the best I can do with a

200
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,880
given system in a given State um in a if

201
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,000
if I constrain myself on just wave

202
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,360
processes but

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,399
uh the disadvantage of that tic

204
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,800
availability is the fact that it is not

205
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,800
uh

206
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,160
additive whereas entropy

207
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,560
allows to compute the same things and it

208
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,880
is add it which is much more convenient

209
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,079
and

210
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:46,320
uh um and then we moved we also proved

211
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,200
or said that we can prove um this uh

212
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,800
theorems

213
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,360
about

214
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,279
criteria to determine whether a process

215
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,639
a weight process is

216
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,720
reversible and remember the definition

217
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:03,680
of reversibility

218
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,880
uh process is reversible if we can

219
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,480
undo not

220
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,079
only what happens to the system but also

221
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,600
what happens to the environment so we

222
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,240
have to be able to find some other

223
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,160
process not necessarily tracing back

224
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,160
backwards the original process but one

225
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,600
in which you can

226
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,639
um

227
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:32,000
um bring your system back to your to its

228
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:35,199
initial state while also you bring the

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,240
Environ environment back to its initial

230
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,440
state that definition is very is very

231
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,120
solid and uh conceptually valid but it

232
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,639
is also very abstract it doesn't

233
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,240
correspond to a a practicable um

234
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,639
measurement I mean procedure to

235
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,000
determine whether a process is

236
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,000
reversible or not because if you go by

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,519
that definition you're supposed to try

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,320
all possible processes until you are

239
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:06,480
really sure that uh uh you stke them all

240
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,839
and uh is impossible to or possible to

241
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,360
um bring back those states to their

242
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,560
Originals uh and so that's clearly

243
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,240
impracticable instead uh

244
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:25,560
property diabetic Avail availability or

245
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:29,720
uh entropy or also available energy

246
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,320
um are allow you to one is if you know

247
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,040
how to know how to measure it them and

248
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,399
we know because now we have the

249
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,760
measurement

250
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:43,000
procedures it uh they allow you to have

251
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
a quantitative Criterion to decide on

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,760
the

253
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:51,199
reversibility uh on the reversibility

254
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:55,720
and actually you can also quantify the

255
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:59,600
irreversibility um in terms of how much

256
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,639
these properties uh that um appear the

257
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,079
criteria

258
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:09,040
uh change so in a reversible process and

259
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,560
remember here we're talking about weight

260
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,600
process just weight process in a

261
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,120
reversible weight process the entropy

262
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,120
remains

263
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:27,839
constant in a in an irreversible weight

264
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,839
process the entropy increases

265
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,240
that the together with the fact that

266
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,120
entropy is ative that entropy can be

267
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,199
exchanged via

268
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,320
interactions see you can transfer

269
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,320
entropy from one system to the other is

270
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,720
something that you do remember the

271
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,880
example of the can of Coke in the

272
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,920
refrigerator well uh when it cools down

273
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,120
uh there is not only energy that goes

274
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:00,399
out of the can into the air refrigerator

275
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,240
but also uh an tropy flows and we will

276
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:07,160
get to that

277
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,360
uh um and together with that and with

278
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,920
the with the principle of entropy non

279
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,519
decrease which is in weight processes

280
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,079
which is just what we um said about

281
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,880
criteria for reversibility or

282
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,600
irreversibility you can write the

283
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:27,399
entropy balance

284
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,680
equation which contains three concepts

285
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,199
on the left hand side

286
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,360
the change in entropy during the given

287
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,040
process for your system a so the

288
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,680
difference between the final and the

289
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,160
initial entropy on the right hand side

290
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,600
you have two contributions that must

291
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,000
balance the left hand

292
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,600
side the first

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,759
contribution is how much entropy you

294
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,360
have

295
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,440
exchanged between your system and the

296
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,440
envir its environment during the process

297
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05,240
and that is positive if

298
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,160
receive so you have to put it positive

299
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,759
if receive that's the meaning of the SLE

300
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,759
the arrow on the symbol on the energy

301
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:18,800
transer and the second term is the

302
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:24,000
entropy that has been

303
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:27,720
generated by um reversibility so it's

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,120
the contribution to of of

305
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,880
uh of the irreversibility so if the

306
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,279
process is reversible that turn is equal

307
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,040
to

308
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,600
zero

309
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,600
but of course we will return to energen

310
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,240
entropy

311
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,880
balances and as you know if you have

312
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,720
done in previous courses or maybe in

313
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,720
energy conservation or Energy

314
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,759
Technologies uh

315
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,759
courses uh if you done exit G you know

316
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,680
that the combination of the energy and

317
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,559
entropy

318
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,520
balance exergy exergy mean mean

319
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:15,039
meaning the

320
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:19,839
maximum uh useful effect that you can um

321
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:23,319
obtain uh in a for under given

322
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,240
conditions from a system in a given

323
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,439
state or vice versa it's

324
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,880
also so by the combined energy and

325
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:36,679
entropy you can compute what is the

326
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,240
minimum amount of energy so valuable

327
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:43,160
resources that you have to spend in

328
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:46,120
order to obtain a given effect so a

329
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:53,240
given change for example to produce or

330
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:53,240
to heat up uh something uh water

331
00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:00,000
steel all right and again we'll we'll

332
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,480
come back when we talk about um

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,400
in a couple of lectures we will have one

334
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,400
uh review of this exergic

335
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,559
Concepts then we moved

336
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,559
on

337
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,360
to um focus on the equilibrium stat but

338
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,280
not only the equilibrium States because

339
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,880
uh here we have uh in the maximum

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,880
entropy

341
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,039
principle that says that if you have um

342
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,480
your

343
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,720
system and you fix the values of the

344
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,799
amounts of

345
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,760
constituents of the parameters of the

346
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,039
external

347
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,760
forces such as the volume but not only

348
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:50,280
not necessarily only the volume and uh

349
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:54,720
you also fix the value of the energy

350
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:59,400
that fixes only a short part of the long

351
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:03,080
list of values of properties that uh all

352
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,039
together form what we call the state of

353
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,600
the

354
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,120
system so by

355
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,240
fixing this short short partial part of

356
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,080
the list you're leaving free uh the rest

357
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:22,600
of the properties so there are many

358
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:25,440
states that belong to that uh

359
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,919
subset so that share the same values of

360
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,919
the amounts the parameters and the

361
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:29,919
energy

362
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,000
and

363
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,799
among all this uh in in this

364
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,200
subset there is one and only one stable

365
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,919
equilibrium state that is a consequence

366
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,559
of of of the second

367
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,559
law but

368
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,320
uh another theorem is also that that's

369
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,799
stable equilibrium

370
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:01,159
State as the highest value of the energy

371
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:05,640
no other state has the same value it has

372
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,840
the strictly uh uh highest value within

373
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,840
that

374
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:19,799
subset and

375
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,799
finally we introduced the uh the state

376
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:28,480
principle saying that well

377
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,600
if it is true like the second law says

378
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,480
that if I fix the values of amounts

379
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,120
parameters and

380
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,919
energy and these

381
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:43,039
values point to a

382
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,039
unique stable equilibrium

383
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:52,159
state it means that these values fix all

384
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,159
the properties of that

385
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,840
state because fixing the state means

386
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,760
fixing the values of all the properties

387
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,799
so it means that

388
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,720
for the category for this for the very

389
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,240
particular class of states which are the

390
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,200
stable equilibrium

391
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:15,760
States the properties are all

392
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,480
functions of these three groups amounts

393
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,080
parameters and

394
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:25,880
energy of these three properties or or

395
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:30,279
um it's actually uh R if you have R

396
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,880
constituent is R values um you it's like

397
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:36,080
as many parameters as you need plus the

398
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,640
energy so R plus s+

399
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,440
one values fix the value of any other

400
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,960
property of the stable equilibrium

401
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,000
State H including the

402
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,480
entropy so that gives them a proof of

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,640
the existence for stable equilibrium

404
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,000
states of this

405
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,000
function which we call the fundamental

406
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
relation

407
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:09,200
and which if it is uh sufficiently

408
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,360
regular or well behaved so that you can

409
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,640
take um

410
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,559
derivatives and these derivatives are

411
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:24,400
not zero infinite you can

412
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,679
um invert this function so instead of

413
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,559
writing S as a function of e and and

414
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:33,200
beta you can write it as e is a function

415
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,200
of s and

416
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,080
beta whereas the fundamental relation in

417
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,360
entropy form this

418
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,880
one is always there for all

419
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,919
systems

420
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:55,000
uh

421
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:59,559
the E versus S so the energy form is

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:05,320
there only for systems for which the

423
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:10,240
these derivatives don't go to uh to zero

424
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:12,679
and therefore um we will see in a moment

425
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,279
that there are some exceptions

426
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:21,640
particular systems that are important in

427
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:22,840
the uh Quantum world for which there is

428
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,200
an upper

429
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,200
Bound in the edge

430
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,600
okay now about taking

431
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,760
derivatives when I have a

432
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,400
function I can write a differential of

433
00:23:49,760 --> 00:24:00,440
the function we just do it uh just for a

434
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,440
uh one variable or say two variables

435
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:08,960
so Z is a function of X and

436
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:13,240
Y and therefore the

437
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:18,320
differential is the partial of f with

438
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:25,360
respect to X time DX plus the partial of

439
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,360
f with respect to Y in d y

440
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,360
okay now we apply

441
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,480
here the that

442
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:41,279
idea to the function to the entropy form

443
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:45,480
of the fundamental relation and

444
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,640
um so written in this way uh really here

445
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,799
what I have is the partial derivative of

446
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,480
s with respect to e that multiplies the

447
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:58,159
E plus the partial derivative of s with

448
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:01,640
respect to uh V the second variable time

449
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:06,919
d V plus the partial derivative of s

450
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:09,799
with respect to n or n i

451
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:14,159
uh times DN

452
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,159
I and so on for all the other

453
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,640
vales we have defined those partial

454
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,039
derivatives look at this one the partial

455
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,960
of s with respect to B we called it one

456
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,159
/ t

457
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,000
because we will

458
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,399
identify so the inverse of that uh

459
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,600
partial derivative as the

460
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,600
temperature of the stable equilibrium

461
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,559
stage this

462
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,399
property notice that is defined based on

463
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,640
the fundamental relation and the

464
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:54,159
fundamental relation is defined only for

465
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,919
the stable equilibrium state

466
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,480
so

467
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,440
temperature is defined only for the

468
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,440
stable equilibrium

469
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,840
States even for the

470
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,720
reservoir we Define

471
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,360
temperature in that particular

472
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,760
way

473
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,960
and it's the temperature of the stable

474
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,960
equilibrium states of the

475
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:28,360
res then we give also names for example

476
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,600
the uh partial derivative of s for

477
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,159
respect to the

478
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,159
volume we call it p/

479
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:44,279
t where P will be

480
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,080
identified as the

481
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:50,240
pressure and the

482
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:53,080
pressure uh I think I will not go into

483
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,679
this uh proof but you can uh prove it

484
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,320
and again find the proof all details in

485
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,559
in the book it's maybe if you haven't

486
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,799
seen it it's useful to go and look it

487
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,279
up the

488
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,640
pressure when a system is uh is first of

489
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,120
all is defined only for stable

490
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,640
equilibrium

491
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,039
States and you say

492
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:22,399
well look if I have a wall and I put a a

493
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:25,039
pressure sensor on the wall uh I can

494
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:29,279
always measure the pressure even if my

495
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:32,360
system is not in a stable State well no

496
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,360
what you're measuring then it's the

497
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:38,360
force per unit area on that

498
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,360
location okay so the force per unit area

499
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,120
you can always measure with with this

500
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,440
with the sensor that we shouldn't call

501
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,799
it pressure sensor it's called Force per

502
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,960
unit area

503
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:53,919
sensor it turns

504
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,000
out that when the system is in stable

505
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,399
equilibrium

506
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,919
state that Force per unit area

507
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:02,640
corresponds

508
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:06,240
to the pressure we find this

509
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,480
way but for example in a known

510
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,000
equilibrium

511
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,679
State when you measure force per unit

512
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,679
area in different locations of your uh

513
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,240
system you may find different

514
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,279
values whereas if your system is in a

515
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,360
stable equum States

516
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,159
state wherever on the surface of the

517
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,880
confining surface of your system you

518
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,240
measure force per unit area you find

519
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,000
always the same

520
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,880
value and that's which corresponds to

521
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,640
the pressure so to give a to fix ideas

522
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,640
suppose I have a

523
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:52,120
box and in my box I got

524
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:55,440
uh some particles and suppose that the

525
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,440
particles are

526
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,039
all uh initially

527
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:08,919
all very regularly distributed

528
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:11,720
only in this central part of the box and

529
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:13,320
they all move in One Direction uh

530
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,760
initially so they they're going to

531
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:21,159
bounce on this wall and then go back and

532
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:26,080
so on U but of

533
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:28,760
course due to some Randomness that uh uh

534
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,640
results from the Collision

535
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,919
their collisions with the wall

536
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,600
eventually they will um scatter around

537
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:41,799
and fill the entire box

538
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,799
right but initially if you measure force

539
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:47,640
per unit area

540
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,559
here when the particles are hitting this

541
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,880
wall all all all here you're going to

542
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:57,880
find a very different uh value from what

543
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,120
you do if you measure um if you measure

544
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,559
uh uh your pressure there and by the way

545
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,559
by what do you mean by uh measuring

546
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:08,399
pressure the pressure measurement is

547
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,799
simply that you

548
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:15,240
conceptually um breaking the wall

549
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:20,840
substituting it with a movable piston

550
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:25,159
and then uh find what force you need on

551
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,080
that little piston of area a small a a

552
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,760
small

553
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,440
area in order to keep fit in the same

554
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,240
place where the wall

555
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:38,240
is once you find this value of of force

556
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,840
that uh then the force per unit area is

557
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:45,039
a s over

558
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:49,399
a and that's the result of

559
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,880
your uh Force per unit area uh gauge or

560
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:55,240
measurement

561
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,240
device but if you do that

562
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,880
here well there are no particles think

563
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,720
there you find zero uh zero Force per

564
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,279
unit area and as the the particles

565
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:14,000
scatter around and distribute and become

566
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:16,639
all randomly um directed then

567
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,519
eventually you will reach an equilibrium

568
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:21,679
the stable equilibrium State and in a

569
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,440
stable equilibrium State you will find

570
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,960
the same values no matter where on the

571
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,120
wall of your system you're going to

572
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,679
measure the force per un unit area and

573
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,320
in that limit so for the stable

574
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,720
equilibrium State you will find that f/

575
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,919
a at stable

576
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,120
equilibrium is equal

577
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,399
to this

578
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,279
P the thing that we call pressure of the

579
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,279
stable equum

580
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,919
State and this other derivatives partial

581
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:57,519
derivatives of a fundamental relation

582
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,559
partial of s with respect to the amounts

583
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,120
of

584
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,120
constituents

585
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:09,679
are if you change sign sign and divide

586
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,679
by T that's the chemical uh

587
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,360
potential of uh that particular con

588
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,600
constituent we'll return to that and

589
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,240
also to a a measurement

590
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,720
device uh that is based again on

591
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,840
measuring Force per unit area

592
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,840
but uh

593
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,360
not directly like this but

594
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:41,360
indirectly by putting

595
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,840
a a semi permeable substituting the wall

596
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,840
with a semi-permeable membrane and

597
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,840
then

598
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,600
measuring the

599
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,600
force per unit

600
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,919
area uh here

601
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,360
where just particles of one type can

602
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,240
cross the semi-perm membrane that will

603
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,519
be a measurement of what we will call

604
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,480
but defines the partial pressure of

605
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:15,639
constituent

606
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:19,360
I and U you measure it again by using

607
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:22,720
this uh pressure uh or Force per unit

608
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,720
area uh

609
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:31,519
gauge all right so back to the

610
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,200
differential of the fundamental relation

611
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,240
so essentially it's this formula except

612
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,679
that for the partial derivatives we've

613
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,399
given names and we'll see um at the end

614
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:47,159
of today why we give names to this

615
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:52,519
partial derivatives because they enter

616
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:55,519
into the uh necessary

617
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,000
conditions that must be satisfied in

618
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,399
order for two when two systems are in

619
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,399
Mutual

620
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:09,879
equilibrium and these conditions will

621
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:12,079
involve this partial uh derivatives and

622
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:14,480
these conditions will

623
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,639
be um

624
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,639
consequences of the principle of Maximum

625
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,639
enthropy that we just uh

626
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,639
reviewed

627
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:30,480
okay now if you

628
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,760
do the same

629
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,119
um development so you write the

630
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,960
differential of the fundamental relation

631
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,119
not in entropy form but in energy form

632
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:45,119
so the the

633
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:48,200
same expression that used sort of um

634
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,079
invert then you write the differential

635
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,760
in this way and you can

636
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:58,000
uh

637
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,200
see and you can see it directly by uh

638
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,880
solving the above

639
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:07,560
equation uh for

640
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:13,480
de so you take de on the left hand

641
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:17,960
side and U and put the rest

642
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:22,320
on on the on the right hand side and uh

643
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:24,280
you uh you can um you can obtain this

644
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,160
equation so it's just

645
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,200
algebra um in this particular form which

646
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,440
is called the gives a relation H you see

647
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,040
that

648
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,839
temperature

649
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,560
pressure the negative of the pressure

650
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,200
and

651
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:44,400
the chemical

652
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,400
potentials are the partial

653
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:53,960
derivatives why why do I say

654
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:58,760
that okay that's because you know

655
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:04,319
the the expression for the differential

656
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,319
geometrically related to if I have a

657
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,440
surface and I focus on one point so

658
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,119
suppose this is a an equilibrium State

659
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,520
and I'm I'm talking about the surface so

660
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,880
this is X

661
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:28,480
Y and Z and this

662
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:32,240
surface has a function f of x y = z

663
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,720
okay so now I'm at a particular Point

664
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,720
let's

665
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:42,920
say with position I mean with

666
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,800
X TI for variable X and Y TI for

667
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,280
variable Y and therefore that would

668
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:53,440
be

669
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:58,040
Z so that particular stable equilibrium

670
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,040
State now I

671
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:08,160
uh writing the differential means

672
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:13,000
writing the equation of the plane which

673
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,000
is tangent to the surface at that

674
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:22,359
point these um partial

675
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,480
derivatives are the slopes of that plane

676
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:28,480
in the directions of X and

677
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Y right

678
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:36,200
now if I rewrite this function uh as a

679
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,920
function so if I solve it so I rewrite

680
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,960
in terms of uh change the independent

681
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,560
variables so I solve it make X explicit

682
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:51,640
so it becomes X going to be a function

683
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:56,040
say of G and Z I'm sorry of of a

684
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,960
function G of z and y so y remains an

685
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,599
independent uh property

686
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,400
and now Z

687
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,079
becomes so it's a different function of

688
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,319
course that's why I write f and

689
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,560
g but it's the same surface so we can

690
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,480
represent the same surface either in

691
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,160
this way or in that way and the tangent

692
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,560
playe therefore it's hasn't changed

693
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,599
doesn't depend on how I decide uh to

694
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:28,560
consider X Y or z uh a pair of them

695
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,560
independent and the other dependent

696
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,359
okay so the

697
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,520
uh so the expression for the

698
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,000
differentials should

699
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,599
be uh the

700
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,200
same in the sense geometrically in the

701
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,839
sense that they should

702
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,839
represent the same the same

703
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,440
uh therefore if I

704
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,920
write um

705
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:06,680
the differential of this function here

706
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:10,000
DX is the partial of G will respect to

707
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:15,839
Z in d z plus the partial of G with

708
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,599
respect to Y in d y okay

709
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,520
but I can solve this

710
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:28,440
equation and write it as

711
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:32,119
DZ equals 1 / by the part of G with

712
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,680
respect to Z time

713
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,920
DX

714
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,960
plus actually

715
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:44,319
minus um the partial of G with respect

716
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,440
to Y divided by the partial of G with

717
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:51,640
respect to Z times

718
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,760
V1 okay so I

719
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:59,319
found either this or that

720
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,319
represent this tangent

721
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,920
play but

722
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:07,200
also this other form represents the same

723
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,560
tangent

724
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,640
plane therefore I can

725
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,119
conclude

726
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,000
that this coefficient of the X in this

727
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,040
in the expression of this you compare

728
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,480
this and that these coefficients are

729
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,000
equal so this is equal to the partial of

730
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,920
f

731
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,480
oops uh the partial of f with respect to

732
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,480
uh

733
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,480
X and

734
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,760
this is equal to

735
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,119
this same plane means same slopes same

736
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,040
coefficients therefore this is the

737
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:52,040
partial of f with respect to Y of

738
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:59,200
course this is true only when f and g as

739
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,880
are related by the fact that one is the

740
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,880
inverse of the other

741
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:13,800
okay and

742
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,800
that's why that's what I have applied

743
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:26,079
here to show that uh

744
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:26,079
if if that relation is 1 / t

745
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,720
it's

746
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:39,280
inverse is the derivative it's

747
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:42,359
yeah it it is equal to the inverse of of

748
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,880
the derivative of G which is the energy

749
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:49,920
form with respect to uh

750
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,520
enter so you go from here to there using

751
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,440
that uh

752
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,000
for

753
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,599
okay now it

754
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,599
immediately St stands out the fact

755
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:07,800
that if you deal with AUM States stable

756
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,960
equilibrium States and there is an

757
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,440
entire uh long chapter about relations

758
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,119
that you can prove between properties of

759
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:22,440
stable St we we just touch on this and

760
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:25,920
it's not our main uh concern but you you

761
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,680
may find lots of papers lots of formulas

762
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,640
and we will use them only when we need

763
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:35,440
them but one thing I need to to use

764
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,599
because that would introduce and to uh

765
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,200
therefore

766
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:45,839
Define uh it's the symbol that we use we

767
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:48,400
use here a symbol we just don't write

768
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,119
only the partial derivative but we write

769
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,760
also parentheses and some substates why

770
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,760
do we do that

771
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,839
uh we do that

772
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,400
because it could happen that

773
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,599
uh for

774
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:16,760
example uh all right we

775
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:18,400
have the fundamental relation

776
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,559
in

777
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,559
uh in energy form written this

778
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,400
way but

779
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,400
for

780
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:41,319
example later we will um give a brief uh

781
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,319
we touch on the subject of changing

782
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,559
variables for example because maybe

783
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:55,000
entropy is not that uh easily measurable

784
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:58,760
in the lab in the sense that uh uh we

785
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,319
don't have an entropy meter

786
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,280
but we have a

787
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:06,920
thermometer

788
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,520
so we measure

789
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,240
entropy

790
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,800
indirectly using the instruments that

791
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,480
are simpler like the thermometer and the

792
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,920
thermometer we will see

793
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,000
measures the

794
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,440
property uh

795
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,559
uh

796
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,040
temperature which is the partial

797
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,599
of this

798
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,559
function with respect to the first

799
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:39,319
variable as written here so why do I put

800
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:42,359
the n and V there okay because you see

801
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:46,480
the next thing I do I can

802
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:51,319
do is for example to uh write an

803
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:54,000
expression of uh how the energy changes

804
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:57,680
let me call it e till

805
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,960
then as a function of t v

806
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,960
and

807
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,160
then

808
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:16,200
see okay so now I look at these two

809
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,680
expressions there are different

810
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,319
functions but for example suppose I'm

811
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:26,440
interested in the pressure I take the

812
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:29,400
pressure it's minus the E the partial of

813
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,359
e will resp ECT to V of the fundamental

814
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,119
relation of this formula but now that I

815
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:35,760
have another function that expresses the

816
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,400
energy in terms of other variables in

817
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,720
which I also have volume I may be

818
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:46,760
curious to see well how about doing

819
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,319
minus the partial of e TI with respect

820
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,559
to

821
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:54,760
V is that the

822
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:57,760
pressure well not necessar actually

823
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,760
enough

824
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,480
and sometimes if I'm

825
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:09,520
sloppy and maybe I say all right this is

826
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,160
the function I'm interested in I don't

827
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,599
want to carry around till there so I

828
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,359
just write it as e

829
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,880
well then I may get

830
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:25,119
confused because when I look at this one

831
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,920
or look at that one which which is which

832
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,000
okay so the idea

833
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,359
is if you want to be

834
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:37,920
careful is to carry with uh your partial

835
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:40,319
derivatives also a precise memory or

836
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,119
indication of what the other independent

837
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:47,960
variables of your function are so if I

838
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,920
write here the other variables so I

839
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,640
write s and

840
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:58,839
n and here I write the other

841
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,839
variables which are t and n

842
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,559
there is no way I can get confused

843
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:07,000
because by just looking at the formula

844
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:09,480
for the partial derivative I know also

845
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,040
what what were the original functions I

846
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:16,359
mean variables of the function of which

847
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:20,040
I'm taking the deriv so this is a

848
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:26,079
notation to to

849
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,079
avoid to get lost uh and Confused

850
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,640
and this kind of confusion is very uh

851
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:38,359
common if

852
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:41,240
you if you don't uh because in many many

853
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:45,160
times maybe you don't need uh this kind

854
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:49,520
of pedantic way of proceeding

855
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:53,200
because the context may be enough if

856
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,720
below if just below that partial writing

857
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,200
that partial derivative you have a

858
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,200
paragraph that says well this is the

859
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,359
equation of which I'm taking the

860
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:04,000
derivative then you're okay the context

861
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:06,440
tells you what is the derivative of

862
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,800
what

863
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,319
uh but if in in more complex situations

864
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,079
where you keep changing variables then

865
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,119
uh this is really uh essential and

866
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:19,800
that's why in the business of the

867
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,359
Dynamics it has been introduced and it

868
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,359
is

869
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,760
standard so

870
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:39,079
also to be sympathetic with ma

871
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,920
mathematicians this I am you should not

872
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,280
read this symbol AS

873
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:47,319
saying the derivative of energy with

874
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,079
respect to volume at constant entropy

875
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:50,079
and amounts of

876
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,040
constituents

877
00:48:52,480 --> 00:49:00,000
but yeah you can say it many people say

878
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:02,760
it sometimes I even say

879
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,240
uh but I don't mean

880
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:10,040
it yeah uh the real meaning of this is

881
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,160
that uh these are the independent

882
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,920
variables so I'm taking the partial

883
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,480
derivative of a function uh the partial

884
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:22,480
derivative of with respect to volume of

885
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:27,599
a function of energy volume uh entropy

886
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:30,400
and amounts of constituents that the um

887
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,400
that's the proper

888
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,480
language

889
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
okay

890
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,880
so why do we give names to temperature

891
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,280
pressure and then chemical potentials

892
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,839
because they enter and we will see it um

893
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,839
hopefully later

894
00:49:54,839 --> 00:50:00,720
today not sure uh any in any way uh

895
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:04,160
because they enter in the conditions for

896
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,160
Mutual equilibrium between

897
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,480
systems so we'll return to this to make

898
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,480
some proofs but just to

899
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,920
anticipate

900
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,680
um when two systems A and

901
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,200
B are in mutual equilibrium it means

902
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,559
that the uh overall system is in a

903
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,880
stable equilibrium State that's the

904
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,880
definition of mutual equilibrium

905
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,880
remember

906
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:35,359
so we will prove and we will actually uh

907
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,119
I want to go over this proofs because

908
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:43,680
they're uh

909
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:43,680
useful uh also for other uh

910
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,880
reasons it turns out that if the two

911
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,160
systems A and

912
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,160
B can

913
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,160
exchange

914
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,640
energy then

915
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,920
they must if if they are a mutual

916
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,040
equilibrium they must have the same

917
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,359
temperature so the temperature of system

918
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,440
a of theable equilibrium state in which

919
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:13,400
system a

920
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,520
is must be equal to the

921
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:19,240
temperature of the stable equilibrium

922
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,119
state in which system B is when they are

923
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,400
in neutral

924
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,760
equilibrium they can also exchange

925
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:31,400
volume for example

926
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:35,280
by means of a move movable piston or

927
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,200
partition uh there's a system as the

928
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,200
Piston moves you see that for example it

929
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,520
moves to the right uh the volume of a

930
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,119
increases that of B decreases by the

931
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,640
same amount so you can say you can say

932
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,559
that the Piston you can interpret it as

933
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,200
the Piston has allowed the systems to

934
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:59,119
exchange volume one gains volume uh by

935
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:03,680
subtracting it from the so it's like a

936
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,880
transfer of volume all right in that

937
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,359
situation in order for the two systems

938
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,960
to be in mutual equilibrium you need

939
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:13,079
also pressure

940
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:19,200
equality If

941
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:22,880
instead you have a porous wall or a semi

942
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:26,599
THM membrane that allows the

943
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:30,359
exchange of one of the constituents from

944
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,359
system between system a system

945
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,720
b h

946
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:40,280
well the necessary condition for Mutual

947
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:42,880
equilibrium is equality of the chemical

948
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:46,040
potentials of that constituent so the

949
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,040
chemical potential of constituent

950
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,280
I measured in system a must be equal to

951
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,040
the chemical potential of system B

952
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,920
measured in system

953
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,880
B so we will prove this because are very

954
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:02,440
important and actually regarding quality

955
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,960
of chemical potentials we will uh go a

956
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,680
long way in finding a very uh

957
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,160
interesting results and important

958
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,440
results for

959
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:17,160
applications but before we go and prove

960
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:21,440
uh these uh conditions for Mutual

961
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:24,319
equilibrium I promise that I would uh

962
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,760
review what we have done so

963
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:32,960
far you may call it thody without

964
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:36,839
heat so far and by means by using by

965
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,760
introducing this um energy versus uh

966
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:43,720
entropy uh

967
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,720
diagram representation of

968
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:52,240
states which is uh so important that we

969
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,240
put it in the cover of uh uh our

970
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,960
book okay this is a

971
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,319
the surface this is a fundamental

972
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,319
relation for

973
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:15,440
water all right so how do we get to

974
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:18,000
construct these energy uh energy versus

975
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,000
entropy

976
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,640
diagrams again we start from the idea of

977
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:27,000
State a state is a long list of numbers

978
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,920
usually very long

979
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,119
we Define a few of uh now these numbers

980
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,319
are the properties are the amounts of

981
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,200
constituents the values of the

982
00:54:33,319 --> 00:54:41,680
parameters but also all the

983
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:45,359
properties of our uh

984
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,359
system at the given instance of time

985
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,559
among these properties we have energy

986
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:54,160
and entropy but we have also many

987
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,799
others so in order to have a complete

988
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,040
representation geometrical

989
00:54:55,799 --> 00:55:00,839
representation

990
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,599
for a for a state of a system you would

991
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,720
need

992
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:08,799
um um

993
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,640
an A multi-dimensional Space in each

994
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:17,319
where you have one

995
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:20,680
axis for each of the independent

996
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:23,240
properties of your

997
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,839
system and since independent properties

998
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:29,079
of a system are generally very large or

999
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:31,960
even uh most of the times

1000
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:36,559
infinite and you

1001
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:38,760
need to simplify so what we do

1002
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,039
is

1003
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,839
to

1004
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:48,200
uh

1005
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:52,400
project onto a plane but first what we

1006
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:55,559
do is to uh make a cut of this

1007
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,960
multi-dimensional space a cut at fixed

1008
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,559
values of the the amount of constituents

1009
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,799
and the

1010
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:07,440
parameters when I say parameters think

1011
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:09,640
of the volume and that's the most

1012
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,400
common uh at least when you study

1013
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,680
properties of

1014
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,760
substances

1015
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,280
and okay so if I fix the values of the

1016
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,799
the amounts and

1017
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,440
parameters I still have a large

1018
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:28,240
subset I I still uh need um a

1019
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,760
multi-dimensional

1020
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:35,440
space only it's the dimensions

1021
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,720
is uh the full thing minus the the

1022
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,799
amount the number of constituents and

1023
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,559
the number of

1024
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:46,799
parameters still very large then you

1025
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:48,920
project onto all the states onto the

1026
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:54,480
plane made of the two variables that we

1027
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:57,680
must uh uh light energy and it

1028
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,920
okay and then you get a two

1029
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,160
representation and it it's going to look

1030
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,160
like

1031
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,280
this energy

1032
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:09,960
the you

1033
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,319
project so let's look at the generic

1034
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,240
Point

1035
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:16,680
here the generic Point here remember is

1036
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,480
the

1037
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:23,920
projection onto that

1038
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:26,920
plan many states will project onto that

1039
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,920
plane

1040
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,480
because many states will share those

1041
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:34,119
same values of energy and entropy but

1042
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,400
differ in the

1043
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:41,000
values of other properties so they are

1044
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:44,119
different states which nevertheless are

1045
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,039
represented by his saying Point as a

1046
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:47,039
result of the

1047
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,920
projection

1048
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,119
okay now that we have understood the

1049
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,839
geometry let's see what the theorems

1050
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,720
that we have seen so

1051
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:10,640
far uh tell

1052
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:14,839
us about where these States can be in

1053
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,839
this diagram so for

1054
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:21,640
example let's start with the statement

1055
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,599
of the first assertion of the statement

1056
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:27,760
of the second

1057
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:32,160
law it says well consider all the states

1058
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,160
of a system with a given value of the

1059
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:39,240
energ all right so fix the value of the

1060
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:46,960
energy all the states will collapse or

1061
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:46,960
will project onto this um uh dashed line

1062
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:54,359
horizontal

1063
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:57,640
and you see we

1064
00:58:54,359 --> 00:59:00,920
have the max entropy principle that we

1065
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,079
just mentioned that says that among all

1066
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,280
these

1067
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,359
states there is a stable equum

1068
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:11,079
state which

1069
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:14,960
is the one that has the highest value

1070
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:14,960
of there are no other

1071
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:23,680
states with that value or even higher

1072
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,520
values of ENT so that means that there

1073
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,400
is a maximum for the entropy for that

1074
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,680
given value for the energy and uh

1075
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,960
corresponding to that maximum there is

1076
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:36,599
one

1077
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:39,799
state notice it's only one state so this

1078
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,799
particular Point

1079
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:47,520
here is the projection of only one state

1080
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:50,240
whereas here it's a projection of many

1081
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,880
states when you go to equilibrium there

1082
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:58,039
is only one

1083
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,039
state well that's to say that

1084
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:03,520
geometrically this curve which is the

1085
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,640
locus of all the stable equum

1086
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,799
States is a

1087
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:11,799
sort of a wire curve in that

1088
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,799
multi-dimensional

1089
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:18,240
space all

1090
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:22,119
right so there are no states with higher

1091
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:25,520
entropy so all the possible states are

1092
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:29,880
to the left or with the with a lesser

1093
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:33,160
entropy then stable uh the stable equum

1094
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,640
State I do the same uh for another value

1095
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:39,520
of

1096
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,520
energy and I get another stum

1097
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:51,079
State I do it

1098
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:53,520
for the minimum value of

1099
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:56,359
energy

1100
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,720
compatible with

1101
01:00:56,359 --> 01:01:01,760
the fixed values of amouse of

1102
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,599
constituents and parameters that we have

1103
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,520
chosen in order to make our cut of the

1104
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:07,520
multi-dimensional

1105
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:15,280
space and we still have a stable

1106
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:18,079
equilibrium

1107
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,039
State and that's the minimum energy

1108
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:21,039
stable equilibrium

1109
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,920
State we'll come back to this in a

1110
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,920
moment

1111
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,960
uh

1112
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,799
okay the

1113
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:42,960
slope of this

1114
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:42,960
terve you

1115
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:50,039
see this curve

1116
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:53,359
represents this table equilibrium State

1117
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:58,240
the fundamental relation in um energy

1118
01:01:53,359 --> 01:02:00,039
form because it's e is the in the Orin

1119
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:04,359
and the s in

1120
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:06,599
the uh the Oba and so

1121
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:10,160
um this is the this curve is the

1122
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:13,960
representation of E versus

1123
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:17,440
S at fixed the values of n

1124
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,240
andv okay so the partial derivative of

1125
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,200
this

1126
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,400
function

1127
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,799
corresponds

1128
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,799
to that's this thing it's the

1129
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,799
temperature

1130
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,960
or actually partial

1131
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,839
derivative

1132
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:40,520
is slope of the tangent to the curve at

1133
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:43,359
a given State equilibrium

1134
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,720
state so the

1135
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,920
temperature is the angular coefficient

1136
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,960
of the tangent

1137
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,960
line the

1138
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,960
slope the

1139
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,279
so I can read the

1140
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,680
temperature and

1141
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:08,319
uh I have buil in this

1142
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:09,720
um uh diagram also result that we

1143
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,400
haven't proved

1144
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:17,039
yet

1145
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:20,640
namely uh the concavity of this

1146
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:25,799
fundamental relation implying that as

1147
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:28,880
you go um high in energy so you go

1148
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:33,480
stable equilibrium states with higher

1149
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:36,880
energy the slope goes up they also have

1150
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,760
higher temperature so temperature is an

1151
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,240
increasing function of

1152
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:46,119
energy but

1153
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:50,440
remember temperature is defined

1154
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:52,319
only as being the slope of this curve

1155
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:56,480
only for the stable equilibrium stage

1156
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:59,480
for which there is a curve

1157
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,599
you are inside here there is no

1158
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:06,000
fundamental relation there is no uh

1159
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,000
function to take derivatives there is no

1160
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:09,359
temperature

1161
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:18,359
okay yeah maybe you can compute things

1162
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,359
like the average kinetic energy of the

1163
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:24,559
particles

1164
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,720
but uh

1165
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:29,799
whereas the this is related to

1166
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,799
temperature at stable

1167
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,240
equilibrium it is

1168
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:37,240
not temperature if you're off

1169
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:47,760
equilibrium of course for stable

1170
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:52,680
States

1171
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:56,440
um all right said yes as I as I go um

1172
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:58,279
down in energy I reach the

1173
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,920
uh minimum energy stable equilibrium

1174
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:06,240
State and this here another buil in

1175
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:09,119
another feature that goes by the name of

1176
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,880
the third law of thermodynamics it says

1177
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:17,440
that the lowest energy stable

1178
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:20,279
equilibrium state has zero

1179
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:23,960
temperature we will not prove that as

1180
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:27,359
this comes more from the model from the

1181
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:30,359
models uh um of the statistical

1182
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:32,160
mechanics or quantum

1183
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:36,200
mechanics

1184
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:41,720
so we don't we have nothing to add to uh

1185
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:43,240
to the uh important but uh uh very very

1186
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:47,119
well known

1187
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,119
result it comes from

1188
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:56,240
physics uh in a moment we will we will

1189
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,039
also see but I can anticipate that uh um

1190
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,960
the

1191
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:08,020
entropy takes a minimum

1192
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:09,440
value and the minimum value is for those

1193
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:11,680
[Music]

1194
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,359
particular

1195
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,240
uh non equilibrium

1196
01:06:14,359 --> 01:06:20,400
States for

1197
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,400
which the adiabatic

1198
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:29,400
availability is equal to the energy or

1199
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:33,359
better to the difference between energy

1200
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:36,039
and the minimum energy uh for allows for

1201
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:38,039
that given combination of amounts of

1202
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:43,760
constituents and

1203
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:46,640
volume so if I have a a state uh

1204
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:50,480
here this state from this

1205
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:53,240
state you can transfer in a weight

1206
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,839
process to the weight you can extract

1207
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,119
out of your system in a weight process

1208
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:02,960
all the energy of the

1209
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:06,160
system meaning that you can take that uh

1210
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,240
State uh and bring the system down to

1211
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,240
this state the minimum

1212
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:16,279
energy you can do this this here and you

1213
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:16,279
extract this much

1214
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,640
energy uh whereas in in a moment you see

1215
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:27,640
that if you do that uh in

1216
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:30,760
a uh no equum State the Artic

1217
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:34,440
availability corresponds to this much

1218
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:37,079
you can go at most down to this stable

1219
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,039
equilibrium State and if you start from

1220
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:42,839
a stable equilibrium State remember what

1221
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:44,640
the impossibility the theorem about the

1222
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:47,000
impossibility of perpetual motion

1223
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:51,079
machine of the second

1224
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,680
kind says there's no way you can start

1225
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:56,200
from an equilibrium from a stable

1226
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:58,200
equilibrium State and extract energy in

1227
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,880
a weight

1228
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:05,279
process and here it

1229
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:08,279
is you cannot go

1230
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:11,400
down in a weight

1231
01:08:08,279 --> 01:08:14,160
process you see in a weight process the

1232
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:17,679
the feature is that if you want to go

1233
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,960
down to being energy here you need to

1234
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:23,480
also reduce the entropy but you cannot

1235
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,480
ruce the entropy in a weight

1236
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:30,759
process let's will return of course in

1237
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:30,759
to these

1238
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:39,560
ideas here I just wanted to say that

1239
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:44,279
there are some special systems for

1240
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:44,279
which there is an upper bound to the

1241
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:53,159
energy these systems are those that do

1242
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:57,960
not have translational or rotational uh

1243
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:57,960
uh or vibrational uh inrease of

1244
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,040
freedom and because if you have a

1245
01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:06,839
translational degree of Freedom a

1246
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,080
particle uh can

1247
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:12,400
move if it can

1248
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,719
move uh you can accelerate it to do as

1249
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,799
much velocity As You

1250
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:21,839
Wish yeah there is the limit of the

1251
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:24,880
speed of light so on uh maybe that is an

1252
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:26,120
upper bound I've never really thought

1253
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,239
about that

1254
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:33,440
uh but here we're talking about systems

1255
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:36,040
like um the spin of an

1256
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,440
electron okay so if you want to

1257
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:42,480
concentrate on just the

1258
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:42,480
spin feature of an

1259
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,279
electron without all the other details

1260
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:51,679
so that the electron must not be bound

1261
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:54,880
in a in an atom and so on but if you can

1262
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:57,920
define a system in which the only aspect

1263
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,480
that you are interested in is the spin

1264
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,880
or if you like the spin it could be like

1265
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:08,719
the polarization of

1266
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:10,520
photons these are very um typical of

1267
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:13,199
phantom

1268
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:17,239
Optics because you can with lasers and

1269
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:20,320
so on you can produce beans or very

1270
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:23,040
diluted beans with the with photons like

1271
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:26,679
you can treat one Photon one at a time

1272
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:29,960
and uh you can uh using using particular

1273
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:34,440
filters when you produce these poons you

1274
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:37,760
can have them polarized in various ways

1275
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:41,760
okay but these various

1276
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:46,080
ways um are

1277
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:49,480
Finance so if you like the spin or maybe

1278
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:54,239
even an atom can be modeled with a

1279
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:59,320
finite um number of energy

1280
01:10:54,239 --> 01:11:02,120
levels and if it's finite it

1281
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:04,480
means that the energy cannot go above a

1282
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:09,159
certain the the upper energy

1283
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,159
level okay well in that in this

1284
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:17,159
situation the sa equilibrium State

1285
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:22,679
fundamental relation looks like this

1286
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:25,960
when you project on eus S diagram

1287
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:27,760
um this is what this is the ersus say

1288
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,920
this is the fundamental relation that

1289
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,920
you

1290
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,640
obtain

1291
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:39,120
okay that function that you're

1292
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,400
representing it

1293
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,120
there let me write it uh as s is a

1294
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:47,360
function of

1295
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:51,120
e so this is e

1296
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,120
minimum this is e

1297
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,360
maximum and the fundamental relation

1298
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:06,960
s is a function of

1299
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,880
e plus whatever other uh parameters and

1300
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,520
amounts

1301
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,520
are looks like

1302
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:23,159
that all right so yeah no nothing more

1303
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:26,719
uh for systems with translational

1304
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:30,159
degrees of freedom as versus e

1305
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,159
instead there is a

1306
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:38,159
minimum particles are not moving so

1307
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:42,080
there's no kinetic energy and therefore

1308
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:44,960
you have you they are

1309
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:47,639
minimum and this corresponds to the zero

1310
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,639
temperature uh stable equilibrium State

1311
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:55,600
and then uh this is

1312
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:55,600
uh well the fundamental relation

1313
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:03,400
the one that we have seen

1314
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:06,000
uh just in the previous dier but if

1315
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:10,400
there is an upper

1316
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,040
bound you reach this value here and you

1317
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:16,880
go

1318
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,880
down so look at what happens to the

1319
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:25,920
slopes here the slope is infinite

1320
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:34,159
and remember that the uh partial of s

1321
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:36,560
with respect to e is the inverse of the

1322
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:40,520
temperature 1 /

1323
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:43,360
T so if the SL if 1 / T is infinite the

1324
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,360
temperature here is

1325
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:51,320
zero then it reaches a maximum the

1326
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,480
entropy reaches a maximum for a value of

1327
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,480
the

1328
01:13:54,040 --> 01:14:02,800
energy so we are we are moving this is

1329
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,800
zero temperature it reaches a maximum

1330
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:09,320
here here the inverse of the temperature

1331
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,080
is equal to zero because the slope is

1332
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:13,920
equal to zero so that means the

1333
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,920
temperature here is

1334
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:26,040
infinite and then you go on the other

1335
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:31,920
side here and the entropy goes down

1336
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:34,320
so you get another state with zero

1337
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,360
entropy another stable equilibrium state

1338
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:40,040
with zero entropy corresponding to the

1339
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:43,159
maximum energy the second law is still

1340
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:46,440
satisfied for every value of the

1341
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:48,960
energy there is one and only one stable

1342
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,960
equum

1343
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:57,320
State you cannot do it the other way

1344
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:59,560
around in other words if I fix the value

1345
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,560
of the

1346
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:05,239
entropy so the

1347
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:07,880
minimum energy principle instead doesn't

1348
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:10,000
apply in this case in this case it does

1349
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:13,040
I fix the value of the

1350
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,440
entropy and the stable equilibrium State

1351
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,600
corresponds to the minimum

1352
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:21,320
energy because the state the possible

1353
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,639
states are only in this area here and

1354
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:27,320
that's the minimum energy but for a

1355
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:29,920
special system like the one that we

1356
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,000
talking about I fix the value of the

1357
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,719
entropy and there are two stable

1358
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,480
equilibrium States one with minimum

1359
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:40,239
energy and one with maximum

1360
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:43,920
energy except

1361
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:47,600
here I fix the value of the entropy

1362
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,600
there is only one stable equilibrium

1363
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:56,000
State and

1364
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:59,320
uh if I fix it a higher value of entropy

1365
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,320
than this one there are no

1366
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:08,480
States so also this last state so like

1367
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,840
the third law says that there is um zero

1368
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:15,760
uh temperature for the minimum entropy

1369
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:21,920
energy stable equilibrium State It also

1370
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:25,520
says that implies I mean I mean that uh

1371
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:29,480
the temperature of the highest

1372
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,480
energy stable equilibrium state is

1373
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:40,199
zero however here you have a little

1374
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:42,400
problem somehow of discontinuity because

1375
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:42,400
you

1376
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:49,000
go yeah I forgot to say one important

1377
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,960
thing the slope on this side of the of

1378
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,040
the

1379
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,400
curve is

1380
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:58,159
positive okay whereas on this other side

1381
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:00,679
of the curve the slope is

1382
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:02,800
negative so

1383
01:17:00,679 --> 01:17:06,239
all

1384
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,960
these uh part of the uh all these stable

1385
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:12,600
equilibrium states have negative

1386
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:15,080
temperatures negative

1387
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:18,679
temperatures are not so exoteric they

1388
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:23,239
were discovered in uh I think it was

1389
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:26,719
1956 that's when I was born by uh Ramsey

1390
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:29,320
at Harvard

1391
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:29,320
just next

1392
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,280
door and actually his daughter was the

1393
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,280
wife of Professor

1394
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,120
kek who was

1395
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:48,120
downstairs and uh with whom I have done

1396
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,120
my Master's

1397
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:56,840
physic okay all right so negative

1398
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,840
temperatures

1399
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:03,320
we will see that the idea of negative

1400
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:07,880
temperature is I mean the

1401
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:10,800
the uh the name is not really uh very

1402
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:13,560
good because you say negative it's below

1403
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,960
zero well really actually if temperature

1404
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:19,600
measures uh the tendency of a system as

1405
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:22,800
we will see to uh yield energy to give

1406
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:26,760
out energy

1407
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:32,239
um these negative St temperature

1408
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:36,920
states have a have more uh

1409
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:40,639
tendency uh to give out energy than uh

1410
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,639
the positive temperature equilibrium

1411
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,360
States uh they're hard to

1412
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:53,239
keep also because uh we

1413
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:56,199
we I don't know if we can make in a lab

1414
01:18:53,239 --> 01:18:58,440
a something that has a properties of

1415
01:18:56,199 --> 01:19:02,320
that we could call Reservoir although

1416
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:05,679
I'm not sure but uh uh that we could

1417
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:08,000
call uh Reservoir with a negative

1418
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:10,239
temperature I'm not sure it can be done

1419
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:14,639
in the lab

1420
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:18,120
uh simply because most of the times

1421
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:20,560
reservoirs have been constructed uh uh

1422
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,600
by using systems that have translational

1423
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:26,560
degrees of freedom and therefore they

1424
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:29,600
have no negative temperatures but

1425
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,760
maybe uh it is

1426
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:35,520
possible also to do a a reservoir with

1427
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,520
negative temp

1428
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,360
anyway so we have a problem here that uh

1429
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:45,280
the temperature goes from

1430
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:48,199
zero positive values to plus infinity

1431
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:51,159
here then immediately after it switches

1432
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:53,800
to minus infinity and it goes down to

1433
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:58,520
zero again so it's some there is some

1434
01:19:53,800 --> 01:20:01,880
sort of dis continuity if we uh insist

1435
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:05,679
in talking of temperature but if instead

1436
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:09,880
we look at a scale in which we uh

1437
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:12,239
instead of temperature we do minus one

1438
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,239
over

1439
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,280
temperature uh

1440
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:25,199
this which can be interpreted uh again

1441
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:28,679
as the tenden and escaping tendenc for

1442
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:31,840
energy so the still measures the energy

1443
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:36,560
the the the tendency of a system to in a

1444
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:39,199
stable equum state to give up uh um

1445
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:44,199
energy and

1446
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:47,760
um you see then this property here for

1447
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:49,080
this curve would go from minus infinity

1448
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,320
in

1449
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:56,320
the minimum

1450
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:58,880
energy minus infinity it goes to zero

1451
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,040
and from zero without this continuities

1452
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:05,639
it goes to plus

1453
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:09,840
infinity so that is also a better scale

1454
01:21:05,639 --> 01:21:12,800
so this is the uh it also shows you that

1455
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,480
U um this property is continuously

1456
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:19,480
increasing from minus infinity through

1457
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:22,080
zero to plus infinity and these ones

1458
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,400
that have a high value for this property

1459
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,080
are the

1460
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:28,199
hotter uh

1461
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:33,480
if we understand as hot something that

1462
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:33,480
has a strong tendency to give out

1463
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:43,080
energy okay so this much for

1464
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:46,800
um special

1465
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:50,000
systems now let's go back to our sucess

1466
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,600
diagram and try to visualize the idea of

1467
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,520
adiabatic availability remember

1468
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:57,239
adiabatic availability is

1469
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,000
a property that measures the maximum

1470
01:21:57,239 --> 01:22:01,760
amount of energy that you can extract

1471
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,280
out of a system in a given state in a

1472
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,360
wave

1473
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:11,639
process and you manage to extract it

1474
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:14,440
when you manage to take your

1475
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:18,560
system yeah there is a y there that's a

1476
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,560
wrong spelling that's uh

1477
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:24,000
Italian it's also wrong in Italian

1478
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:26,800
anyway I'll correct it uh it has to

1479
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,840
finish to end up in

1480
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,840
a stable equilibrium

1481
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:36,719
State and that uh process must be

1482
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,840
reversed okay so what do we know of the

1483
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:49,600
reversible process or reversible weight

1484
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:51,760
process in terms of enthropy what did we

1485
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,040
learn we call in the principle of

1486
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,760
entropy non

1487
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:00,239
decrease but we called it also Criterion

1488
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:03,159
for reversibility of processes if a

1489
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:07,000
process a weight process is reversible

1490
01:23:03,159 --> 01:23:12,120
the entropy stays constant okay so let's

1491
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,120
do this in a plot I start from my

1492
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:19,239
system in some State

1493
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,239
here generic State

1494
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:26,600
E I make a process in which I want to

1495
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:30,080
take an energy out of the system so the

1496
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,880
energy goes down because I'm taking out

1497
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:35,440
of the system it goes down because I

1498
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:38,800
want to give it to the

1499
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:42,159
weight I want the process to

1500
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:45,000
be not only weight process but

1501
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:47,840
reversible so in a reversible weight

1502
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,600
process the entropy doesn't change so I

1503
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,800
go

1504
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,800
down this

1505
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:57,080
way I go down and until there are

1506
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:03,040
states uh eventually I reach the

1507
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:04,520
minimum uh energy stable equilibrium

1508
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,679
state with that

1509
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:09,960
entropy and there are no more States

1510
01:24:06,679 --> 01:24:13,000
below that so that's all I can do in a

1511
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:16,800
reversible weight process this is is as

1512
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:19,639
much as I can go

1513
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:22,719
down so the difference between the

1514
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:26,320
original energy and the energy of the

1515
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,320
lowest uh

1516
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,880
energy stable equilibrium state with the

1517
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:35,400
initial

1518
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:37,639
entropy is thetic availability so this

1519
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:40,400
is the visualization of thetic

1520
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:43,679
availability it's the distance in that

1521
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:46,480
diagram uh between your state and the

1522
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:49,480
stable equilibrium uh

1523
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,480
curve

1524
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:56,679
vertically so for example if I consider

1525
01:24:53,679 --> 01:25:00,280
if my initial state were

1526
01:24:56,679 --> 01:25:00,280
here at zero

1527
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:07,600
entropy you see I can go

1528
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,159
down and

1529
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:13,320
meet the zero

1530
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:16,840
entropy uh stable equili

1531
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:24,520
state which is the minimum

1532
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:24,520
energy state stal state of uh of mcats

1533
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,040
or

1534
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:33,239
actually regarding this area it's uh us

1535
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:36,239
this it's discussed in the book I don't

1536
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:37,239
want to go to the details but uh somehow

1537
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:41,600
there is

1538
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:43,360
a this is not necess this stum St is not

1539
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,119
necessarily zero

1540
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:49,280
entropy it's zero temperature by the

1541
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:50,880
third law but it could have a

1542
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,520
finite

1543
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:58,520
entropy equal to the logarithm of the

1544
01:25:53,520 --> 01:26:00,920
degeneracy of the uh of of of that

1545
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,920
lowest energy your ground

1546
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,920
step

1547
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,480
uh okay nevertheless the amount of the

1548
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:14,920
diotic availability for a for the S

1549
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:17,600
Forest state with zero um entropy is

1550
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:21,719
equal to the difference between its

1551
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,719
energy and the lowest

1552
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:29,880
energy for those value of amounts and

1553
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:34,199
Par so this is the visualization of

1554
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:37,560
thetic availability if I go the more for

1555
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:39,600
a given energy the more I go to states

1556
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:42,960
that have higher

1557
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,800
entropy the less adiabatic

1558
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:48,560
availability they have until I reach the

1559
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,600
stable equilibrium state that has zero

1560
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,360
diabetic

1561
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,239
availability I'm already there I cannot

1562
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:58,360
go down vertically because there are no

1563
01:26:55,239 --> 01:27:02,400
States available

1564
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:06,520
there okay we talked about

1565
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:09,000
resir remember Reservoir have a

1566
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:11,560
constant temperature they're stable

1567
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,560
equilibrium

1568
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:17,119
State and all the same temperature

1569
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:25,679
TR for as long as the system behaves as

1570
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,880
a as a res because as we said if I make

1571
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:33,239
Reservoir with uh make um yeah if it's

1572
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:35,159
done like water at a triple point H as

1573
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:37,119
long as I have all the three phases

1574
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:40,760
coexisting that is behaves as a

1575
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:40,760
Reservoir in St equum

1576
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:48,040
States but if I put too much energy for

1577
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:50,960
example and one of the phases

1578
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:55,159
disappears uh then that does that system

1579
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:57,719
doesn't behave as a res anymore so it's

1580
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:59,960
it's in a limited range of states the

1581
01:27:57,719 --> 01:28:03,080
system can be headed as a thermal

1582
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:07,760
resware or can approximate because that

1583
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,760
is an an approximation

1584
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:13,679
practice because rigorously rigorously

1585
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:15,239
uh speaking

1586
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:21,480
uh

1587
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:24,520
uh true resare doesn't really uh exist I

1588
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:29,159
know confusing new but some sometimes

1589
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:34,360
it's good to be confused uh because the

1590
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:36,480
reservoir is a very limiting uh

1591
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:42,280
uh

1592
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:44,400
system and uh in fact if you think

1593
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:48,679
deeply enough you find also this

1594
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,040
discussed in the book uh you you see

1595
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:53,840
that strictly

1596
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:56,880
speaking uh if a wrestle were satisfied

1597
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:59,280
it's defining features it would be

1598
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:03,239
violating the second

1599
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:07,639
law all right so we are using that as a

1600
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:11,880
limiting system and this in

1601
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:15,520
fact allowed me to say that uh

1602
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:18,639
in in the years after publishing that

1603
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:21,800
book we've been uh

1604
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:25,119
uh together with Professor Z of

1605
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:27,040
University of bologa in Italy

1606
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:30,719
uh who contributed also in some of the

1607
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,719
proofs of the book uh

1608
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:38,600
uh we went on and tried to find an

1609
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:42,199
alternative way of defining entropy

1610
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:45,000
without not without the

1611
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:50,320
reservoir without uh because the

1612
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,320
reservoir is some some sort of a

1613
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,960
macroscopic

1614
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:57,800
object and we want to to do it more

1615
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:02,719
generally so that it our definition of

1616
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:08,639
we could extend also uh to microscopic

1617
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:08,639
situations but also in an operational uh

1618
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:12,560
therefore

1619
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:17,920
laboratory

1620
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:20,560
uh applicable measurement uh

1621
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:25,639
procedure we so we did we have some

1622
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:28,880
papers around uh around that concept

1623
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:32,880
and uh also some also a famous

1624
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:38,760
mathematicians s l uh

1625
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:42,560
in later on I mean after our book has uh

1626
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:46,800
published U alternative definitions of

1627
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:49,600
any for non States and

1628
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:52,719
initially uh they didn't do it for non

1629
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:56,920
equum States but then they realized that

1630
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:58,760
um they could do it that uh we were sort

1631
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:02,400
of doing the same

1632
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:05,639
thing so what I'm saying is

1633
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:10,800
that I'm telling you this definition of

1634
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:16,199
entropy uh as it were an easy uh stuff

1635
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:16,199
but it's not really very easy because

1636
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:26,440
conceptually uh entropy has

1637
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:30,840
always uh been a a a difficult uh

1638
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:34,800
um topic uh to understand there's so

1639
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:37,520
many facets one is the laboratory the

1640
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,639
other is the statistical and now we have

1641
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:43,679
also the

1642
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:46,040
quantum uh so it has so many facets that

1643
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:49,840
uh you shouldn't

1644
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:51,080
say yes I understand what entropy is on

1645
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,960
the other

1646
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:56,320
hand you should say that you understand

1647
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:59,440
what entropy is you know like

1648
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:03,800
contradicting a bit because if you want

1649
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:06,040
to go home now and say well what's what

1650
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,520
what did you learn in thermodynamics

1651
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:12,679
course so

1652
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:14,239
far well I learned you could say that uh

1653
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:17,000
yeah there is energy everybody knows

1654
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:17,000
about

1655
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:26,040
energy with energy you can do useful

1656
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:27,920
things but not all the

1657
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:32,159
energy

1658
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:35,719
is convertible into useful

1659
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:38,400
effects uh in

1660
01:32:35,719 --> 01:32:41,239
fact

1661
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:44,239
entropy is a measurement of that part of

1662
01:32:41,239 --> 01:32:47,040
the energy that cannot be converted into

1663
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:48,360
useful effects so from an engineer point

1664
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:52,080
of

1665
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:57,400
view that's a very clear statement and

1666
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:57,400
it's true that's not controversy about

1667
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:04,760
this

1668
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:08,520
okay all right so let's move on um

1669
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:11,080
because we're running out of time and

1670
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:14,560
um so the

1671
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:17,119
reservoir has stable equilibrium

1672
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:20,040
states that all have the same

1673
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:23,840
temperature so since temperature is the

1674
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,440
slope of the fundamental relation of the

1675
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,000
curve that represents the fundamental

1676
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,920
relation the fundamental relation for a

1677
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
resing work is a straight

1678
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,600
line so the equation for a straight line

1679
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
is this

1680
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,880
one changes in

1681
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,679
energy are related to changes in entropy

1682
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,400
between two if the system goes from one

1683
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,400
stable equilibrium state to another

1684
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:51,159
stable equilibrium State and therefore

1685
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:53,840
it moves along this

1686
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:56,000
curve then

1687
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,880
the ratio of the energy change to the

1688
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,679
enthropy change is equal to the

1689
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,679
temperature of the

1690
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:10,199
res

1691
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:13,440
why uh we use the the reservoir remember

1692
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:18,000
we used it so that we could

1693
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:21,600
uh make that property additive uh so we

1694
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,400
build we built additivity

1695
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:27,040
into uh the concept of diabatic

1696
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:29,800
availability and in fact if we consider

1697
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:33,600
the adamatic availability of a composite

1698
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:35,159
system composite of a system like a

1699
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:38,560
normal

1700
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:41,480
system and the

1701
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,320
reservoir then thetic availability of

1702
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:47,880
this

1703
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:47,880
situation is what we call available

1704
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:55,360
energy it is a it turns out to be a

1705
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:57,920
property of system a for given uh with

1706
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:00,040
respect to a given vers it's called

1707
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:04,400
available energy of a system with

1708
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:05,400
respect to a given energ and resir and

1709
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,760
we have

1710
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:12,360
given the formal expression in terms of

1711
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:14,520
energy and entropy so you can

1712
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:17,440
compute

1713
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:20,480
uh the available energy the maximum work

1714
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:23,199
that you can extract from your system A1

1715
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,360
it has available the possibility to

1716
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:29,280
inter

1717
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:33,280
with a res and exchange with

1718
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,600
it so let's see how we can could

1719
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:38,080
construct see this is the formula for

1720
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,080
available

1721
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:45,159
energy and how can we construct uh uh

1722
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,159
that

1723
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:51,320
formula so here

1724
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,320
is

1725
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:58,960
the eus diag for our system

1726
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:01,760
a fixed values of n

1727
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:04,239
andv stable equilibrium State

1728
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:07,639
curve let me consider

1729
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,639
Again State

1730
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:14,440
A1 if for State A1 I make

1731
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:22,119
a um reversible weight

1732
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:25,719
process I can go uh the entropy remains

1733
01:36:22,119 --> 01:36:30,880
constant and I can go down this much and

1734
01:36:25,719 --> 01:36:30,880
that's how I extract thetic I mean

1735
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:40,159
thetic when I want to extract the

1736
01:36:36,199 --> 01:36:42,679
available energy here remember in the in

1737
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:45,880
the end in the final

1738
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:49,080
State the composite system must be in a

1739
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,840
stable equilibrium State it's only then

1740
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:54,040
and only when I reach the stable

1741
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:56,560
equilibrium state that I cannot extract

1742
01:36:54,040 --> 01:37:00,239
anymore in a weight

1743
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:02,199
process so stable equum state for a

1744
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:05,320
combination means Mutual equilibrium so

1745
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:08,040
the final state of system a is in mutual

1746
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:10,280
equilibrium with the

1747
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,920
reservoir all right if the reservoir is

1748
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,920
a temperature

1749
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:20,679
TR when the system a is in usual

1750
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:24,239
equilibrium with the reservoir we said

1751
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:25,920
that we will prove that uh

1752
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:28,280
the two systems in mutual equilibrium

1753
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:33,000
must have the same temperature so system

1754
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:36,560
a must end up in the stable equilibrium

1755
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,440
state that has a slope that has

1756
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,560
temperature equal to the temperature of

1757
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:44,080
the

1758
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:48,840
Vel so if this is temperature resare I

1759
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:51,239
go and look for the point here on on

1760
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:53,920
this curve where the slope is equal to

1761
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:55,520
tr that is the state in which system a

1762
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,280
will be in mutual equilibrium with the

1763
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:00,679
res and that is going to be the final

1764
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:03,840
state of system

1765
01:38:00,679 --> 01:38:03,840
a you

1766
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:12,840
see uh in order to go from the initial

1767
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:12,840
state of system a to this final

1768
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:19,639
State I need to change the

1769
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,639
entropy

1770
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:29,639
system in this case since State a r is

1771
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:34,679
to the right in the diagram of State

1772
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:36,719
A1 the entropy Sr is greater than S1 and

1773
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:39,119
one

1774
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:43,119
possibility is

1775
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:45,679
to let entropy

1776
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:50,119
increase by means of some spontaneous

1777
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:52,080
process let make a weight process an

1778
01:38:50,119 --> 01:38:53,679
irreversible weight process in an

1779
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:56,679
irreversible weight process I can

1780
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:59,040
increase the an and so I can go from

1781
01:38:56,679 --> 01:39:04,360
here to to there in the weight

1782
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:07,239
process and the amount of energy I would

1783
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:09,360
extract in that wave process would be

1784
01:39:07,239 --> 01:39:13,400
only the difference between the

1785
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:17,719
initial final energy that's the energy

1786
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:17,719
balance so it would distract only this

1787
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:25,360
much

1788
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,360
but in another way

1789
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,719
is

1790
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:34,119
to since I need this entropy in order

1791
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:37,239
for to go from here to there I can ask

1792
01:39:34,119 --> 01:39:39,480
it to the reservoir the reservoir is

1793
01:39:37,239 --> 01:39:44,360
there and

1794
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:44,360
uh interacts with my

1795
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:54,440
system in whatever way is uh uh allowed

1796
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:57,280
so they can also Exchange

1797
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:57,280
uh

1798
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:04,800
entropy so if I if I ask the resw to

1799
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:10,639
give me this much entropy so that I can

1800
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:14,560
go from here to here in the entropy uh

1801
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:17,639
axis the reservoir let's go back to the

1802
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:21,599
so if if the reservoir has to give me

1803
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:25,320
some entropy it means that it must go

1804
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:25,320
from here to the left

1805
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:32,719
in order to give me some

1806
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:37,599
entropy

1807
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:37,599
it it can give me also some

1808
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:45,599
energy So I says all right

1809
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:48,960
R while you're giving me this much

1810
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:51,840
entropy and going from here to here you

1811
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,840
can give me also that energy go from

1812
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,960
this stable to the new stage to this

1813
01:40:53,840 --> 01:41:00,080
lower energy stable equum State and that

1814
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,080
energy becomes

1815
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:06,080
available to

1816
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:10,920
go to the

1817
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:14,560
weight so the P the reservoir you take

1818
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:18,199
energy out of the

1819
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:21,080
resir and give the energy to the weight

1820
01:41:18,199 --> 01:41:25,080
and give the entropy to the

1821
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:25,080
system yes

1822
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,360
and

1823
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:38,880
therefore uh you can see this uh um

1824
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:38,880
inclined line you can view it also as

1825
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:46,599
the stable State C for the residir so

1826
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:50,440
this much

1827
01:41:46,599 --> 01:41:53,800
energy reduction of

1828
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:58,119
uh uh

1829
01:41:53,800 --> 01:42:01,239
of the for the reservoir implies this

1830
01:41:58,119 --> 01:42:03,599
much energy so this are much entropy

1831
01:42:01,239 --> 01:42:04,760
reduction inlies as much energy

1832
01:42:03,599 --> 01:42:09,599
reduction

1833
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:13,239
so in addition to the energy that you

1834
01:42:09,599 --> 01:42:15,920
can extract directly from system a going

1835
01:42:13,239 --> 01:42:18,840
from here to

1836
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:22,159
here so difference between final initial

1837
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:24,280
and final energy of system a you can add

1838
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:27,599
also this

1839
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:32,440
much as energy

1840
01:42:27,599 --> 01:42:35,280
that is extracted from the Reser and

1841
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:35,280
therefore

1842
01:42:36,119 --> 01:42:41,599
geometrically geometrically the

1843
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:43,760
available energy is the sum of these two

1844
01:42:41,599 --> 01:42:48,239
contributions which is also the

1845
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:50,880
geometric representation of this

1846
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:55,119
formula

1847
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:55,119
okay all right well

1848
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:02,760
I think we will take it from here but I

1849
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:05,000
want to skip this for the moment and uh

1850
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:08,280
uh so the next time I still have to do

1851
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,480
what I I didn't manage to do today it's

1852
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:12,199
the the necessary conditions for Mutual

1853
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:14,920
uh uh

1854
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:19,639
Equity so I

1855
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:20,920
think yes time is up for today so I'll

1856
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:25,119
see

1857
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:25,119
you on Friday
