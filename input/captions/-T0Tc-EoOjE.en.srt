00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,160
hi everyone I'm Gaya Saras I'm a postto

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,520
here at the broad and I have the

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,240
pleasure of just introducing our speaker

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,440
for today's seminar

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,280
series um today the person that's going

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,520
to be presenting is Dr Gomez inclan she

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,760
is an early career researcher with a lot

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,119
of experience in culture editing and

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,720
differentiation of human stem cells her

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,000
career has focused on a lot of things

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,640
including modeling interactions to

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,560
dissect their pathology aiming to Aid in

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,960
their prevention or treatment and during

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,200
her doctorate over at the University of

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,280
Queensland she generated um brain and

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,879
liver cultures both Judd and 3D to study

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,000
for rare autosomal disease in Axia and

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,120
excuse me telling glacia uh currently in

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,320
her post-doctoral position at SM smbs

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,879
she's using ipscs to generate

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,280
hypothalamic brain organoid

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,640
models over the last few years um Dr

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,879
Gomez inlan has done a lot of work in

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,840
her doctoral research identified the

25
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,840
post- transational modification for the

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,600
Catalyst proteins that could alleviate

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,600
the inflammatory response in patients

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,439
with a taxia glacia um in addition to

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,000
all of this she uncovered differences in

30
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,960
the tox toxicity of beta amalo peptide

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,799
variants in the cortical brain organoids

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,759
and focused on unraveling the diversity

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,439
of physical and protein

34
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,960
biomarkers of Cellular cence in stem

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,520
cell derived mesenchimal stem cells um a

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,240
critical fate currently being

37
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,159
investigated by a lot of different

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,720
trials and for treating multiple

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,520
conditions um I know this is a rather

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,759
long introduction but I cannot speak

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,000
highly enough of um her work and at the

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,880
current time Dr Gomez inclan is

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,200
developing a Robos protocol for

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,600
hypothalamic organoid differentiation at

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,200
SM

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,360
sbms and her research is advaned

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,280
advancing frontiers of brain disease

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,719
modeling um overall in the last five

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,280
years Drome inclan has developed a

50
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,360
robust and diverse skill set in the area

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,160
of stem cells biology and

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,760
differentiation and she has pinpointed

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,440
and addressed a lot of critical

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,840
knowledge gaps across diverse research

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,160
settings um I think that is quite a bit

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,720
of an introduction and I have a pleasure

57
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,319
of presenting today's speaker so Dr

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,000
Gomez and Clen once you're ready we can

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,800
begin yeah thank you very much yeah so

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,360
thank you so much for having me here I I

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
am very grateful with everyone involved

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,599
in the organization and also with

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,080
Cynthia that I think she was a

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,319
contacting point for this talk to happen

65
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,120
so I work at in in Australia at the

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,120
University of Queensland right now here

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,319
it's like 5:00 a.m. in the morning so

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,519
bear with me if my language like goes to

69
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,400
mysterious places um I work at school of

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:03,360
H biomedical Sciences at the um um with

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,040
Stefan S he's the the leader of the

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,840
group and yeah I'm going to be

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,560
presenting you what I have been doing

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,840
this past year in my first postdoctoral

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,280
position with calian rhythms and

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,120
hypothalamic organ so I just want to

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,239
give you a little bit of a background of

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,080
who I am so and what I have done so

79
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,560
pretty much I was bornn and raised in

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,239
Mexico City so for if there is any other

81
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,799
people from Mexico I am ch completely

82
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,159
and I thought to share this beautiful

83
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,799
map of what Mexico City used to look

84
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,599
like when the aexs were around so it's a

85
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,120
map of the N plan um I did my bachelor

86
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,439
studies at theam University of national

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,159
autonom Mexico uh and I was very lucky

88
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,680
to do the basic fire medical research

89
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,040
program and I say I was very lucky

90
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,959
because this program allows us from the

91
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,000
very start of our Bachelors to be a

92
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,159
little bit handsome on in different

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,879
research um groups so I was involved in

94
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,519
some re Research In The Institute of

95
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,840
biomedical Sciences in The Institute of

96
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,959
cellular physiology the faculty of

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,079
medicine and I also did an internship in

98
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,519
the Stars Institute for medical research

99
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,840
in Kansas

100
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,520
City H after that that's when I came to

101
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,600
Australia ER there is this little

102
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,000
product called Vite if you haven't tried

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,039
it I would suggest you to have a look at

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,240
it it's Str very

105
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,639
interesting and here I started my PhD at

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,680
the Australian Institute for

107
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,759
bioengineering and

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
nanotechnology uh that's where I was

109
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,360
doing a cortical organoids but we also

110
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,240
did liver organoids and also to the

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,639
liever and cortical models and then I

112
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,199
just joined like a little bit over a

113
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,360
year ago in the school of biomedical

114
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:04,639
Sciences so with no further Ado I will

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:07,680
continue we talk of the actual science

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,880
so in the lab we focus on the

117
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,759
hypothalamus which is a very small area

118
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,880
of the brain it actually accounts for

119
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,479
around

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,880
0.5 four of the total volume of the

121
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:23,400
whole human brain however although it is

122
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,240
very small it is also very very diverse

123
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,919
so the hypothalamus can be divided into

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,440
three four different regions and then

125
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,639
they are further subdivided into nuclei

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,560
that are pretty much functional units

127
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,440
within the hypothalamus that are

128
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,360
involved in very important ER

129
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,840
physiological processes such as feing

130
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,880
Behavior thermal regulation body fluid

131
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
so this is would be more like blood

132
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,440
pressure and things like that and sleep

133
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,880
wake cycle ER puberty and fertility so

134
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,479
things related to reproduction also the

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,759
aggressive behavior and stress response

136
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,520
and the way that usually the

137
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,800
hypothalamus does all this work is

138
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,880
through the re release of neuropeptides

139
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,400
from the hypothalamus to the anterior L

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,479
of the pituitary gland and then other

141
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:24,319
hormones are released from this um gland

142
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:28,520
to other um organs where it exerts their

143
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,759
um their effects so just to give you an

144
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,919
example here

145
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:38,479
of one of the pathways for instance with

146
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:41,000
a cortisol release the um corticotropin

147
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,680
releasing hormones from the hypothalamus

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,560
would be released to the anterior L of

149
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,960
the P gland and then it will induce the

150
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:56,240
cleavage of the pro opium opio

151
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,160
melanocortin hormone that will result in

152
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,280
the generation of this peptide that is

153
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,919
called adrenal

154
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,160
adrenocorticotropic hormone those are a

155
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,520
mouthful and then they go to the adrenal

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,599
gland and then that's that's where the

157
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,039
cortisol gets released so I am telling

158
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,160
you uh about this very complex little

159
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,479
area of the brain that mediates many

160
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,080
physiological processes and anyways the

161
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,840
the the difficulties or the complexity

162
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,199
doesn't stop there because these

163
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,639
processes don't happen constantly even

164
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,800
during in a day but instead they are

165
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,680
regulated within a day so just to give

166
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
you staying with the example of the

167
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,120
cortisol what we know that is that in

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,639
plasma the cortisol will vary right and

169
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,639
we usually have a peak right before in

170
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,440
humans when right before we wake up then

171
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,240
if we go and check for act in plasma as

172
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,240
well you would notice that there is like

173
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:02,280
a mild increase as well usually a little

174
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,680
bit before the cortisol release and then

175
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,240
what we know about the CR in cereal

176
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,000
spinal fluid in humans is that there is

177
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,199
also small Pig a little bit before the

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,120
other two happen however as in my

179
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,400
cartoon I think you cannot see here the

180
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,759
hypothalamus right so this is not a

181
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,440
mistake um um we can actually not access

182
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,240
this area of the brain that easily and

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,560
especially in humans like it's not like

184
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,000
we can just like um assess

185
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,760
systematically this stuff so we have

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,560
used different models like for instance

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,519
here in in rat that we know that the CR

188
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,479
transcript in the paraventricular

189
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,120
nucleus where it is what where it is

190
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,880
actually produced and then it later on

191
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:53,080
released from um in rats it actually

192
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,519
also varies within the day so these

193
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,079
modulations are very important for our

194
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:03,279
physiology and um this kind of

195
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:05,399
of rhythms are called circadian rhythms

196
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,519
and they just called that because in

197
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,360
Latin circadium means about a day so

198
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:15,920
that means that these are processes that

199
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:19,360
happen every 24 hours sort of De and the

200
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,680
basic molecular mechanism that regulates

201
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,560
the Cadian rhythms and won a Nobel priz

202
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,399
in 2017 but it is pretty much in a very

203
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,320
few words is a feedback loop negative

204
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,399
feedback loop of transcription

205
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,160
factors so in 2004 there was this

206
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:42,200
beautiful experiment very elegant where

207
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,920
they fused one of these transcript the

208
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,959
genes of the transcription factor to

209
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,200
Lucifer

210
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:53,880
is in order to assess in EX in explans

211
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,640
of M how does a Cadian Rhythm looks

212
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,000
like so turns out that whenever these

213
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,399
tissues are outside of the body of the

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,480
system of the

215
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,519
physiological environment in these

216
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,040
animals you can see that different

217
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:13,519
tissues will react differently um so

218
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,480
some of them will keep the Cadian Rhythm

219
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,040
but maybe the amplitude will change

220
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,720
maybe something will happen some other

221
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:26,240
tissues will almost lose the these waves

222
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,839
um and so maybe some others will still

223
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,640
have waves but they are not exactly at

224
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,519
the same time time as others so this is

225
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,279
just telling us like the the Machinery

226
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,360
of The sadian rhythms and the actual

227
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,880
waves of of the circadian rhythms pretty

228
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,279
much happen everywhere in our body um

229
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,959
however they need to be synchronized all

230
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,160
of them so that all the physiological

231
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:55,480
processes happen as they are meant

232
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,079
to so how this happens is via the side

233
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,279
fers and I think that's pretty much

234
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,079
German and I have no clue German so

235
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,560
apologies if I am not saying this in the

236
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,519
correct way but they are pretty much

237
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,279
exogenous signals that will indicate

238
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,920
what time of the day it is so there are

239
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,720
cues like light eating and exercise and

240
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,160
this um cues the signals will reach the

241
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,279
PAC makers in the body that is pretty

242
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,399
much the cutting Machinery that will

243
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,639
then inform the rest of the body um to

244
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,760
be synchronized at the same pace

245
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,839
so I just want to stress out this is a

246
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,639
very complex system and we are very

247
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,240
interested in observing a little bit

248
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,160
closer to the hypothalamus and how these

249
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,160
Dynamics with the

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,160
neuropeptides

251
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,800
happen both in the hypothalamus and you

252
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,839
already know we are working with organal

253
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,399
how do you pipe it in the

254
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,279
time so if we think about the sight

255
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,680
givers that I was telling you about

256
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,720
light food and exercise well light is

257
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,639
definitely not a goal because we don't

258
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,720
have the Machinery that it requires to

259
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:13,880
detect light and food could be however

260
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,399
um just like getting rid of the food of

261
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,279
the media or not feeding the organ could

262
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,720
be a little bit problematic in the sense

263
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,839
like it is also supporting all these um

264
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,199
neuronal Network so we are

265
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,399
not keen to do that and exercise is

266
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,199
definitely an

267
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,920
however like second order side givers or

268
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:39,240
a little bit of the response of of the

269
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,320
first order side givers are hormones or

270
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,959
metabolites and changes in body core

271
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,760
temperature and hormones are already

272
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,880
something that we can actually pipe it

273
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:53,279
in things like melatonin cortisol and

274
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,920
Insulin um particularly cortisol is

275
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,959
interesting um probably you know this

276
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,079
back in the ' 90s and early 2000s there

277
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:06,639
are heaps of experiments and heaps of

278
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:09,399
reports using theosone that is a es that

279
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,079
is very fairly similar to cortisol

280
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,279
people have been using it in many

281
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,839
different initro settings for

282
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,000
synchronizing Cadian rhythms and in

283
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,079
terms of metabolites like glucose and

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,360
lipids this this reminded me to the

285
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:29,120
usage of maybe FBS um that is like also

286
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,800
very commonly used for cardan synchron

287
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,800
ization in initro

288
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,000
settings and so those two could be core

289
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,199
core temperature is not not a good one

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,160
just because the fact of the our

291
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:46,399
incubators in the lab they are usually

292
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,760
not exactly that good at maintaining the

293
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,880
temperature when it comes to very little

294
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,759
changes and that's what we would be

295
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:59,480
facing so probably nothing more than

296
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:01,360
0.5 changes of in Celsius so that that

297
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,320
is also something that we wouldn't be

298
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,600
that Keen to to

299
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,279
try so having kind of an idea of how we

300
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,160
would like to do that we just want to

301
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,600
keep in mind that

302
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,399
27% of the coding cycle in at least one

303
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,519
in humans that's kind of the last

304
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,680
report and in the hypothalamic

305
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,639
neuropeptides will probably be cycling

306
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,240
and that's exactly what we want to focus

307
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,040
on so having that in mind I just just

308
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,279
want you to to come back to think with

309
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,000
me about the model that we need to use

310
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:40,680
for trying to make these studies and so

311
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,759
you already know we are focused on human

312
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,639
that's what we want to study and that's

313
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,120
where the power of the stem cells come

314
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,600
where you actually have these Pur potent

315
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,240
stem cells that you can differentiate

316
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,560
into different into different models

317
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,759
sorry something that is very important

318
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,639
is that theels should must have the

319
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,480
calian machinery uh I have told you that

320
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,360
most of the cells have it but not

321
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,880
exactly all of them so for instance a p

322
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,800
poent CS don't have all of these

323
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,399
expressed so when you do the

324
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,000
differentiation you just need to make

325
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,680
sure that you have them in your um in

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,720
your differentiated

327
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,839
cultures now we want to have a system

328
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,319
that is isolated right and so you have

329
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,319
seen like it's so robust system systems

330
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,319
and very complicated systems and the

331
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,920
hypothalamus at the end of the day works

332
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:38,199
like an integration Hub of a lot of

333
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,319
different signals and then the output is

334
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,000
also so diverse in terms of all the

335
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:46,279
physiological aspects that it can

336
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,399
regulate so you would have a lot of

337
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,720
confounding confounding variables when

338
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,920
you are dealing in animal models which

339
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,560
of course you can desect and take

340
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,639
advantage even to to some degree o of

341
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,519
them however H we think that having a

342
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,480
very isolated system will be very

343
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:09,360
beneficial and that is why also we think

344
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,199
um organiz are a very good idea and of

345
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,079
course cellular diversity is a most

346
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:19,959
foros having in mind the diversity that

347
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:22,959
the hypothalamus has so there was in

348
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:25,759
2024 or 2023 there was this report that

349
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,959
there are around 108 different clusters

350
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,199
of neurons in the hypothalamus so it's a

351
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,839
extremely

352
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,880
diverse area of the brain and we would

353
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,040
like to capture at least a little bit of

354
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,040
that

355
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,880
complexity so that brings me to what

356
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,160
people have been publishing before in

357
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,000
terms of hypothalamic models human

358
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,399
hypothalamic models um and there have

359
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,160
been to the best of my knowledge and

360
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,480
probably there are maybe a couple of

361
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,680
more now but 18 research articles coming

362
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,279
from eight different research groups um

363
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,399
and what they have been doing is exactly

364
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:04,360
taking potent themselves and

365
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,880
differentiating them towards

366
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,760
hypothalamic

367
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,240
regions so as you can see there are 2D

368
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,199
and 3D and something to bear in mind

369
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,400
here is that when you're are doing 2D

370
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,079
cultures and you are differentiating

371
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,439
them ER most of your cell will be seeing

372
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,799
roughly the same things so you will end

373
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:28,600
up with a very homogeneous nice layer of

374
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,760
cells however when you go to 3D you have

375
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,960
a um yes your cultures are facing still

376
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,320
all the small molecules and everything

377
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,120
that you are giving to them to Quee

378
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,440
towards the differentiation process

379
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,080
however because they are so close

380
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,360
together they will start secreting even

381
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,559
um factors themselves that that will

382
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,760
help the self-patterning and will help

383
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,159
this generate this

384
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:59,600
diversity of cell types um so for

385
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:03,440
instance in the organoids um you often

386
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:07,360
expect to have like some astrocytes some

387
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,520
oligodendrocytes as well along with your

388
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,000
neurons uh but something that I should

389
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,760
also mention is that as any other model

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,320
organ are not the perfect model and

391
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,200
there are couple of reasons why so one

392
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,440
of them is that they certainly don't

393
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:30,760
have a microa the resent microphases of

394
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:33,720
the brain and that is because of of um

395
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,520
the protocol that that we do because we

396
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,360
cue the differenciation towards

397
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,360
ectotherm so microa is not coming from

398
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:46,520
that germ layer so we cannot get

399
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:50,120
microa another thing I will be talking

400
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,000
about along this talk but however we

401
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,280
know that there is people that are doing

402
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,120
hypothalamic human organoids and we

403
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,159
decided to give it a go in our hands so

404
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:05,559
we just took a one of the protocols SK

405
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:09,000
2018 and we enriched it with some of the

406
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:14,159
um other protocol from Merle

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,400
2015 and what we have is this um

408
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:20,400
protocol that as I was telling you first

409
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,000
you cue the differentiation towards

410
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,760
neuro ectotherm this is a very basic

411
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,200
step with a dual smart inhib that people

412
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,919
do for cortical but also for other ER

413
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,360
brain organoids and then you have to um

414
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,720
signal for in what region of the brain

415
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,480
the hypothalamus is right so the

416
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,240
hypothalamus is in the ventral most part

417
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,840
of the brain so it often receives a lot

418
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,480
of signal of Sonic Hedgehog so that's

419
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,840
exactly what you have to add in the

420
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,520
media and then for the anterior

421
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,919
posterior a you need to add a proper

422
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,559
level of wind signaling we do that with

423
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:05,320
wind 3A so that's pretty much just

424
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:08,000
positioning or just ske where in the

425
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,840
brain you you want

426
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,320
this um then in the next steps pretty

427
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,640
much a early hypothalamus and maturation

428
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,440
you are just promoting this exit of the

429
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,919
cell cycle for having your neurons and

430
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,240
you're promoting the maturation of the

431
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:29,640
neurons um and in this protocol we ended

432
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,120
up we ended it at day 1550 and we did

433
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,039
that because that's essentially where

434
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,120
the this other project that protocol

435
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,520
that we based based on

436
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,320
finished something to have in mind is

437
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,960
when we were comparing all the other

438
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,960
protocols that I was showing you before

439
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,840
um the more small molecules the more

440
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,840
cues you add to your differentiation

441
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,320
protocol the shorter it seems to be um

442
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,400
the the time that you have to wait to

443
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,039
have an an end result right because you

444
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,039
are kind of accelerating the

445
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,559
developmental process and there are

446
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,880
protocols for even hypothalamic models

447
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:13,039
that they add much less small molecules

448
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,159
however they need to wait like around

449
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,480
200 days to to have an organoid which

450
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,400
might be fantastic however we wanted to

451
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,720
have a little bit of a shorter protocol

452
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,679
that we could play a little bit

453
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,200
quicker um so this is how our our organ

454
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,480
look

455
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,200
like and we decided to do single solar

456
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,880
just to analyze what we are actually

457
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,679
getting from there and using some data

458
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:48,480
from already published articles we could

459
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,320
see that our organoids were um at least

460
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,760
fairly similar to both adult

461
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,880
hypothalamus

462
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,120
andic

463
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,039
hypothalamus and when we have a closer

464
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,320
look to our single cell that

465
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,000
so we are happy to see that we don't

466
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,279
have neurons we have like neuroblast

467
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
tdes so that's all good but we also have

468
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,320
a lot of Ria that means that we still

469
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,440
have a lot of progenitors going on in

470
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,240
there so this seems that our day 50

471
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,600
organ which are a little bit early in

472
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,120
development and that brings me to the

473
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,760
second main um concern when you are

474
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,080
using

475
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,720
organoids in research and it's because

476
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,640
they often resemble iic stages just

477
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,080
because the stem cells are pretty much

478
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,799
resemble um very early stages so

479
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,880
something that I can tell you already is

480
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,480
that if we leave this organoids

481
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,120
today 80 something like that then we

482
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,840
start seeing markers for astrocytes and

483
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,200
oenocytes and these are that is very

484
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,640
good and that's is exactly what we want

485
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,200
to have and um they often appear later

486
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:02,640
in the development very close to the um

487
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,880
POS natal or their pation time so at

488
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,480
least we have those markers now so we

489
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,799
are confident that we have organ that

490
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,320
are good enough to keep going with this

491
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:17,480
especially because we can also see the

492
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,279
the representation of eight different

493
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,080
nuclei of the

494
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,840
um

495
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,840
hypothalamus which is very reassuring

496
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,720
and we are especially interested for

497
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,440
instance in the lateral a nuclei nucleus

498
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,960
just because this one is very

499
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,240
very associated with

500
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,559
sleep um arate that it has to do a lot

501
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,120
with metabolism

502
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:46,799
paraventricular that is the one that is

503
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,600
involved with a cortisol and all the

504
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,159
pathway with cortisol so those three we

505
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,039
are particularly interested but to be

506
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,799
honest the more the merrier right in the

507
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,960
ideal world we would like to have an

508
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,679
organoid that recapitulates the whole a

509
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,880
repertoire of cells that we see in in

510
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,840
the human brain and so as we speak and

511
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,200
as we are doing these experiments we are

512
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,840
also trying to improve and our

513
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,600
protocol however this is a protocol that

514
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,679
we have currently and we are fairly

515
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,240
happy with

516
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,960
it especially because we also have the

517
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,080
expression of the sadian jeans that we

518
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,080
were talking

519
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,279
about um and can as you can see it's

520
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,480
pretty much a salt and pepper

521
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,880
expression so that probably means that

522
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,919
our organ although they are expressing

523
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,399
the Machinery they are not synchronized

524
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,919
so the question would be can can we

525
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:42,600
actually synchronize them and that

526
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,880
brings us to all those things that we

527
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,760
were thinking before of what to use can

528
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,279
we do actually deame methasone or

529
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:55,480
FBS so that's exactly what we tried um

530
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:59,440
we took the um protocols from many

531
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,720
papers like there are tens of of papers

532
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,399
doing this kind of synchronizations in

533
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,039
other

534
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,159
cultures and what we could see is that

535
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,919
upon

536
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,520
the treatment or exposure to the

537
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,880
dexamethasone or FBS we could see this

538
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,440
Gene cycling and for the rest of the

539
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,720
talk I'm going to be focusing on the

540
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,440
dexametasone treatment not in the FBS

541
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,640
but um where we're very happy to see

542
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,640
that we can actually synchronize

543
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,799
them then we decid decied to go ahead

544
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:37,120
and start exploring what is happening

545
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,919
with this organ over time via a

546
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,960
volaric and what we can see here I'm

547
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:47,279
just showing you six different

548
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,520
neuropeptides so for instance here the

549
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,520
first one this one is hypocretin this

550
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,399
one is very Associated to

551
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,520
sleep um and what we can see is like

552
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:01,679
this this cycle

553
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,240
and we actually didn't know how it would

554
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,679
happen because like this one is known to

555
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,720
be uppr regulated when we are

556
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,399
awake so that is interesting to see that

557
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,360
just modulating the

558
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,840
Circadian Machinery with xamas we can

559
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,360
see this

560
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,279
increase AP is a favorite of mine just

561
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,480
because this one is V oppressing this

562
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,559
one is the one that is regulating blood

563
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,399
pressure and as probably you are aware

564
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,600
ER problems with blood pressure are very

565
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:37,200
common ER worldwide but particularly in

566
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,919
our Latin communities that's a big big

567
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,200
public health

568
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,720
issue then we have a CR the one that we

569
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,080
were talking about so the corticotropin

570
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:52,320
releasing hormone that is um Upstream

571
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,679
from the release of cortisol and H so we

572
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,760
were not expecting a dynamic like up

573
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,000
down up down so we were expecting more

574
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,039
like a dynamic of this sort so we are

575
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,240
very happy to see that it is works

576
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:07,360
almost like a little bit of a control

577
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:12,240
that our system is probably actually

578
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:15,559
working then um G&R is going to dropping

579
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,799
releasing hormone uh this one is

580
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:22,559
associated of course with reproduction

581
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:25,640
and fertility and K one is associated

582
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,840
with the onset of puberty so these two

583
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,399
guys are pretty much in associated in

584
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,720
reproduction but we are still not

585
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,360
taching that yet H but that's something

586
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,159
very interesting

587
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,760
that actually one of our PhD students is

588
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:44,360
kind of going deep into this and the

589
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,399
last one that I want to show you is pmch

590
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,960
because this one is also associated with

591
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,440
sleep and it's also meant to be

592
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,080
increased when one is awake and

593
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,200
interestingly like we can see at Le at

594
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,039
36 hours it seems that it is up both in

595
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,960
hypocretin and

596
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,159
bmch so for this talk like I want to

597
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,880
share with you like our surprise like do

598
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,760
we have in our hands something that

599
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,799
would mimic a sleep model in

600
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,760
hypothalamus that would be we would be

601
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:16,760
very happy with it to be

602
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,840
honest but it this is a very complex

603
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,559
physiological process so we want to try

604
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,039
to figure out whether this could work as

605
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:25,559
a model or not so just to give you a

606
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:27,799
little bit of more insight about

607
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,480
hypocretin so this is exactly how this

608
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:33,799
looks like and this is in

609
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,919
m so it increases the number of neurons

610
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,360
that Express hypocretin we don't know

611
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,559
which are the cells that usually don't

612
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,840
express it and then express it we have

613
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,480
no clue but we know that there are more

614
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,480
cells that express it and that per cell

615
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,720
there are there is more intensity of

616
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,159
hypocretin also or more content and more

617
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,640
transcription in each of those

618
00:28:52,159 --> 00:29:00,440
cells hypocretin is a a gene that open

619
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,159
translation um it it can get tiffed into

620
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,360
two neuropeptides one is called orexin a

621
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:10,720
the other one is called orexin B so for

622
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:13,360
the next slide we tested orexin a bya

623
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,440
immunofluoresence and what we can see is

624
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,559
that over the time in our organ it's

625
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,279
exposed to

626
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:24,559
theone we can see an increase of orexin

627
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:28,720
a at T12 and at

628
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,559
t36 and this increas is very evident

629
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,440
and here is just the quantification of

630
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,120
of this signal and we can see that it

631
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,840
follows the same

632
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,320
ER trajectory that the transcript does

633
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,679
this is the same graph that you saw in

634
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,480
the slide

635
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,600
before um we are also doing and this is

636
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,360
preliminary thata we are doing some

637
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,840
Eliza tests where we can see that by

638
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,880
Eliza at least we can detect that 36

639
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,440
hour Peak so again suggesting like maybe

640
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,519
that 36 hour Peck would be very

641
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,279
interesting if if we want to try to

642
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,760
focus a little bit on on

643
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,720
sleep so again because this is a very

644
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,720
complex

645
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,360
um process physiological process we want

646
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,880
to try to figure out other ways where we

647
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,960
can explain it so this could be a

648
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,519
cellular inessence maybe you are

649
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,640
familiar with this like you have to

650
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,840
gather evidence of like many different

651
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,080
uh experiments to say like okay this is

652
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,640
cellular SES I think this that this is

653
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,559
what Wiles need to say like you know we

654
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,360
have a model of sleep we would need a

655
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:43,080
lot of different experiments and a lot

656
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,480
of different hints that would suggest

657
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,120
that and because of that I found this

658
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,399
paper from

659
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,799
2012 ER where they were pretty much

660
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,480
trying to figure out the transcriptomic

661
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,320
signature of what H being awake would

662
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,799
look like and in

663
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,559
V so how they do how the way that they

664
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:09,200
did this was pretty much they used

665
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:11,720
cortex of mouse with sleep deprived

666
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,639
control and recovery and then for the

667
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,399
inra setting they culture the cortical

668
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:21,440
neurons and they added a cocktail um

669
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:25,519
that pretty much um activate

670
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,320
synapses um or just synaptic activity

671
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,960
and they call that this is kind of

672
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,200
active awake neurons and this is the

673
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,120
list of genes that in theory they should

674
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:42,559
be up in vitro as well as they see this

675
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,639
in in the cortex and then there is like

676
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,760
the list of gen that should be down

677
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:51,440
regulated H please bear in mind this is

678
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,639
mouse not human and this is cortical not

679
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,200
hypothalamus so this is just some of the

680
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:59,200
thems that I'm trying to come up to

681
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,399
figure out whether this is or

682
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,080
not however interestingly for the set of

683
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:09,799
genes that are actually or should be op

684
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:12,480
regulated in when the cells are awake

685
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,960
that means at 36 hours for us

686
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,000
potentially I found this gen being a

687
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,559
little bit higher in expression ER

688
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,679
exactly what this means I'm still not

689
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:28,679
sure but we are we're going further into

690
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:30,720
this and interesting it's interestingly

691
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:34,279
I found like this set of genes that are

692
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,519
actually upregulated at 48 hours and

693
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:40,159
there are a few of them so I'm not

694
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,760
exactly sure what this means yet but it

695
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,840
might be that this is just like a little

696
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,000
bit of a late

697
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,360
um signal that they this were awake or

698
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,960
that this is a they are awake we because

699
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,240
we don't really understand the Dynamics

700
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,159
of this anyways yet uh for the ones that

701
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,480
are down regulated or that should be

702
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,240
down regulated I found only these three

703
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,000
and it is not that evident but we are

704
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,799
going to continue to check this

705
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
further so what other things can I do to

706
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,720
try to figure out this so of course we

707
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,720
need to do imun also for pmch for

708
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,880
instance Al npvf is a good candidate

709
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:27,320
npvf is it should be potentially down

710
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,799
regulated um during a weake um during a

711
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,399
week

712
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,760
stage um we want to keep doing

713
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,000
transcriptomics and just the analysis of

714
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,919
it um I am a web lab and I am

715
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,639
transitioning a little bit to analyze

716
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,000
this in a little bit of more

717
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:47,960
um you know computational area so using

718
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,960
a little bit of fire and Python and for

719
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,440
sure I don't know if you guys but I find

720
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,919
that challenging coming from only a web

721
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,399
lab

722
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,639
experience we also want to analyze the

723
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:02,399
secret via M spectometry just to have

724
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,760
like the full bread of neuropeptides

725
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,119
that we can detect coming out from

726
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:12,320
those organoids so so far we can detect

727
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:16,000
by Eliza the ones that we have tried

728
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,359
that are CR and or X in a those are the

729
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,720
ones that we have right but we would

730
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,560
like to have like the full bread so we

731
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:24,839
have some samples down in Melbourne so

732
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,159
this is happening as we speak so fingers

733
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,399
crossed we will have a lot of data

734
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,440
coming from

735
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,240
this

736
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,720
experiment um we also would like to

737
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,720
check neuronal activity via

738
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,960
multi-electrode array arrays the only

739
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,280
thing is that um often when we think

740
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,480
about sleep we we think about these

741
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,399
waves of sleep problem is those waves

742
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,200
are coming from the cortex not from the

743
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,240
hypothalamus and apparently the

744
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,720
hypothalamus is a rather quiet space um

745
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,760
so I am not sure what we would be

746
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,920
looking at

747
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,680
but any information would be good

748
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,680
information so this is probably anyways

749
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,000
very valuable

750
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,400
information and also another thing that

751
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,400
we should do is check for cellular

752
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,960
metabolism

753
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,520
so we have seor so we are going to check

754
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,680
for oxygen consumption but also we would

755
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,000
like to check for maybe a mitochondrial

756
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,599
activity because it has been seen that

757
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,800
it is usually of regulated when one is

758
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,800
away comp to when we are

759
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,280
sleeping we have some other future

760
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,560
directions

761
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,200
um so for

762
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,960
instance how much of this is meditated

763
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,240
by synaptic activity so we are already

764
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,240
doing some experiments with some

765
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,400
Inhibitors in there just to try to

766
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,680
figure that

767
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,440
out um what is the effect of different

768
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,200
sight givers in on different cell types

769
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,560
so we are currently doing those

770
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,359
experiments with melatonin and we are

771
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,760
going to be starting with a

772
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:08,800
insulin um is

773
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,680
there a hierarchy in the response of the

774
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,960
hypothalamus because like the the main

775
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,480
contribution or or the major um sight

776
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,760
Giver would be light right and light

777
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,000
will it directly go to the hypothalamus

778
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,760
and regulate there but it also is

779
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,720
receiving these cortisol signals and we

780
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,560
can very well see that it is responsive

781
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,599
to cortis very evidently so what kind of

782
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,960
of hierarchies are there or maybe there

783
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,160
are not hierarchies and they are just

784
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,480
integration of signals for but how they

785
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,240
happen we don't really

786
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,760
know are there differences in males and

787
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,920
females in the hypothalamus there there

788
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:55,040
are um differences for instance we have

789
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:58,079
women have more one neurons remember

790
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,680
 one is the is a peptide I told you

791
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,280
that is involved with puberty so we have

792
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,800
more of those neurons compared to males

793
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,520
and what happens with different genetic

794
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,560
backgrounds or even in disease like what

795
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,359
happens with narcolepsy like for

796
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,160
instance in narcolepsy often or a lot of

797
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:19,839
the patients have a mutations in the

798
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,839
hypocretin

799
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,880
gene um because of my background and

800
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,960
because of how the the climate the

801
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,079
biological CL climate that we have is

802
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,599
what happens with in other cultures like

803
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:40,200
what did we do organoid of different um

804
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:44,040
parts of the body like how comparable

805
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,040
would be the responses to these site

806
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:50,319
givers and this is even longer term but

807
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,119
we would be very interested to see how

808
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:52,960
this plays out because for sure there's

809
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,480
going

810
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,640
to happen like how would it look in an

811
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,160
body on a chip so that means like what

812
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,200
if you put organ of different areas of

813
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,800
the body and you connect them all of

814
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,680
them and then what if you set time in

815
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,640
the different ones and see how this

816
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:19,960
whole system um react so pretty much

817
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,560
just dissecting every single way of this

818
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,440
machinery

819
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,480
and that that is what I think would be

820
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,359
happening in in the future like I don't

821
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,680
know like five to Years hopefully and

822
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,280
hopefully we're there to see that

823
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,880
happening or make it

824
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,680
happening so without further Ado I want

825
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,800
to thank you all for your attention of

826
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,400
course I want to thank my B Stefan and

827
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,880
asati that she's my partner in crime in

828
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,280
a lot of these things that I have been

829
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:54,280
showing you today and I'm ready to take

830
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,280
questions

831
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,119
thank you very much for the presentation

832
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,920
um I just want to mention that there's

833
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,920
going to be a short survey and if you

834
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,920
can please fill it out it'd be greatly

835
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,520
appreciated uh first question is from

836
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,920
Daniel Gonzalez a very interesting model

837
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,160
maybe I missed it but how do you

838
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,880
reconcile the lack of sensory Machinery

839
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,440
with the Circadian changes observed in

840
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,960
the organoids do you think the organoids

841
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,520
behave like this regardless of their

842
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
environmental

843
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,240
cues um okay and so we are actually

844
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,000
running the controls where we are having

845
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,520
our organ without any cortisol during

846
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,599
the whole span of the experiment so we

847
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,599
are taking organ every 12 hours as well

848
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,319
just to make sure that the Baseline

849
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:47,319
doesn't um

850
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:50,760
cycle however the data of the Single

851
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:52,920
Cell an6 suggests that they are all that

852
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,680
they are not synchronized so that

853
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,280
shouldn't be an issue but let me know if

854
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,640
that is

855
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,960
what you meant and if I actually

856
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,720
answered your question and maybe the

857
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,359
other aspect of your question that um

858
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,040
because I did say that there are some

859
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,680
cells that do not have the Machinery but

860
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,400
we can certainly tell that our organists

861
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:20,720
do have the Machinery so that should be

862
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,720
up and running I hope that that answered

863
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,880
okay any other questions um is a very

864
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,240
interesting talk sure I'll I'll throw a

865
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,440
question in um for the secretome it's

866
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,200
it's amazing that you're considering

867
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,400
that as a future direction are there

868
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
other things you want to look into in

869
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,839
the secret tone Beyond proteins like are

870
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,079
you thinking perhaps that there are

871
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,880
different things being um secreted out

872
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,720
from the cells yeah so with the secreton

873
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,040
what we are doing is that we are

874
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,040
depolarizing the organoids just to make

875
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,359
sure that they release all the goodies

876
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,920
that they have in there about to be

877
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,240
released and what we would like to see

878
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,440
is pretty much the whole landscape of

879
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,240
the neuropeptides that that could be

880
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,960
released at a given time and that is

881
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,720
because we are very interested in the

882
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,400
metabolic aspect of of it and like just

883
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,040
a very physiological output of it so

884
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:26,160
it's so such a diverse group of cells in

885
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,280
there that impact many things that are

886
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,240
actually associated to many problems

887
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,440
that we have right now as major public

888
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,720
health concerns worldwide that we want

889
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,480
just to try to make sure that we pay

890
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,960
attention or that we can see as much as

891
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,760
we can in terms of all these

892
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,280
neuropeptides that can be released in

893
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,079
our

894
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,079
model fantastic thank

895
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,520
you how uh how many different

896
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,800
environmental stimuli have you applied

897
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,720
to the models to see if it disrupts Circ

898
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,760
at the three so

899
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,440
dexasone FBS and

900
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,400
melatonin and we are using melatonin as

901
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,520
well because it's also pretty much

902
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,960
physiological right I mean it is

903
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,920
produced by in the penal gland so it's

904
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,559
not exactly coming from the hypothalamus

905
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,720
so we can deliver it

906
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,200
extrinsically to some extent so that is

907
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:30,880
why we wait we went with that so when

908
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:36,280
artificial setting we're trying to mimic

909
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,280
as good as we can the the

910
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,800
physiology we do have another question

911
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,880
in the chat um for the type of model

912
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,240
that is used how consistent would it be

913
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:53,760
to measure the markers from rat and

914
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:57,800
organoids I guess rat and human

915
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,960
organoids the type of model it can you

916
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,119
repeat the

917
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,440
question I think there's something

918
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,160
missing but um the question is for the

919
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,040
type of model that is used how

920
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,920
consistent would it be to measure the

921
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,319
markers from rat and

922
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,599
organoids okay so maybe the com the

923
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:19,200
comparison between models um you know

924
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:22,200
what uh probably fairly similar but we

925
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,200
have to pay attention to something very

926
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,319
basic rats for instance are nocturnal

927
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,079
and we are dial and that different that

928
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,040
difference happens in the

929
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,119
hypothalamus so just for the sake of

930
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,720
starting

931
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,200
sleep the things will be like the other

932
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,079
way around and where where the

933
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,559
connection becomes different between

934
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,880
nocturnal and dial it seems to be coming

935
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,720
from the interation of the

936
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,880
suprachiasmatic nucleus that is one of

937
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,839
the nucleus of the hypothalamus to the

938
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,680
paraventricular nucleus where the actual

939
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:59,839
Z is actually released from um

940
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,359
but we're not entirely sure how that

941
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,839
Machinery works so that that's why we

942
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:07,119
have such a big issue at the minute in

943
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,640
that level of complexity when you want

944
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,480
to go more granular that's where using

945
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,720
other animal models it might be a little

946
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,240
bit tricky to make the full

947
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,960
comparison however for sure like all the

948
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,880
animal models are very valuable and will

949
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,480
continue to be super valuable but you

950
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,680
just need to think about what exactly

951
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,440
you're asking and whether

952
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,200
it actually makes sense to compare it in

953
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,960
that particular to to answer that

954
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,760
particular question that's

955
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,359
it that's very true and it's I mean

956
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,720
keeping those details in mind is really

957
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:43,040
important before we come to a

958
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,000
conclusion yes

959
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,079
yes okay I'm going to give people maybe

960
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,440
a few more minutes to drop questions

961
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,960
um speaking of models you said you

962
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,119
wanted to compare male versus female um

963
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,280
biology when it comes to hypothalamus I

964
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,440
I think there was a paper circulating a

965
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,800
little while ago saying that there is a

966
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,559
distinct difference in terms of the

967
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,359
hours of sleep or how much rest is

968
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,559
needed how do you think that's going to

969
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,559
impact potentially the findings that you

970
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:16,880
get you know that's a very interesting

971
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,839
question I am not too sure and the thing

972
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,680
is that b males versus females is more

973
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:25,599
complex than it looks like because it

974
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,400
not it doesn't only come with just the

975
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,599
chromosomes that you have during

976
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:34,160
development for instance we have waves

977
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:37,280
of um estrogen and testosterone flowing

978
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,000
that apparently regulate to some extent

979
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:45,880
the identity and the function of the of

980
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,720
the hypothalamus for later on so at this

981
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:50,440
stage what we are doing is first like

982
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,079
trying to figure

983
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:57,880
out do we have the proper model for

984
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,880
analyzing males versus females

985
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,920
that is more physiologically relevant

986
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,720
that it is

987
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,319
not only having the correct chromosomes

988
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,920
so that is something very important

989
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,640
particularly for the hypothalamus

990
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:15,280
because it is invol with all these

991
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:19,440
reproduction systems right ER how would

992
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,240
it play out later on say we have a a

993
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,000
good enough model that we consider that

994
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:27,240
we want to move forward with it and just

995
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,200
check up the sleep

996
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,520
I'm not too sure I'm I'm thinking it's

997
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,720
going to be very different like I hate

998
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,640
to say this but my partner like he it'ss

999
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,880
like crazy and he doesn't gain weight uh

1000
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,760
but anyways I'm always very hungry and

1001
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,440
and he's not that like that kind of

1002
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,880
things like we often see in the in in

1003
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,680
just like the people that we have around

1004
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,440
um they a lot of that is happening from

1005
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,599
the hypothalamus like all this hunger

1006
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:59,400
this like how much intake but how much

1007
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,720
weight you gain and so it's all wired in

1008
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,520
there I'm not saying that it's the only

1009
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,079
contribution but it's definitely in

1010
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,720
there so for sure we're going to see

1011
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,720
differences in there also another thing

1012
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:14,160
is that after menopause there are heaps

1013
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:17,440
of metabolic changes happening for for o

1014
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,040
um so how to model that that's another

1015
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,400
question and once you can model

1016
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,760
it I'm not too sure what we're going to

1017
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,079
see but for instance like when women hit

1018
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:32,640
menopause the incidents for instance for

1019
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:34,960
Strokes go so high just suddenly

1020
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,720
so I'm not sure and that might be

1021
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,720
related to blood pressure and that might

1022
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,960
be related to vasopressin that by the

1023
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,760
way is actually released from the

1024
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,240
hypothalamus so there are many different

1025
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,000
aspects But first you need to kind of

1026
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,079
tune down what is the model that you are

1027
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,960
going to use and that's what we are

1028
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,160
trying to set up first like just a

1029
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,000
reliable model that is as

1030
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:00,280
physiologically relevant as we can make

1031
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,640
and and then make this very what seems

1032
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:06,480
very basic simple questions that

1033
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,200
actually they are not that

1034
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,920
simple it's true I I had a question as

1035
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,800
well um do you plan on inducing some of

1036
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,800
the genes associated with psychiatric

1037
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,720
disorders because there's a

1038
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,240
disregulation in circadian rhythm

1039
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,119
sometimes with um psychiatric disorders

1040
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,920
like schizophrenia

1041
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:32,119
bipolar no not at the meane what I am

1042
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:36,599
trying to do via

1043
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:40,240
um Viper so and with clap is try to

1044
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:44,200
modulate a gen associated with actually

1045
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,960
obesity so box P2 S one those are things

1046
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,079
that are happening in the hypothalamus

1047
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,520
that we would potentially be interested

1048
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:56,079
to to do um things that are

1049
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,200
psychiatric not at the minute I'm aware

1050
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,839
that there are a bit of things happening

1051
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,760
in terms of

1052
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:06,200
autism and like some papers that have

1053
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,799
come like out with things like that

1054
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,480
especially with epigenetic

1055
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:14,520
modulators but we are not addressing

1056
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,680
that at the minute but why like do you

1057
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,839
have do you work with that is that

1058
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,160
something that we should actually be

1059
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:23,559
looking at uh yeah so um it's

1060
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,960
a with psychiatric disorders it's it's

1061
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,559
anecdotal but like psychiatric patients

1062
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,720
particular bip po different they do have

1063
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:33,000
like a circadian disruption and their

1064
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:38,040
tiny boxs are off right so we don't know

1065
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:42,920
like from a genetic standpoint like yeah

1066
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:45,559
so my colleague asati she's working with

1067
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,960
Parkinson disease and pretty much a lot

1068
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:52,319
of the neuro degeneration diseases that

1069
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,240
we have that are major concerns are also

1070
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:58,640
having a Saran

1071
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:03,040
disregulation so it seems like it is a

1072
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:05,040
very sensitive to some degree system

1073
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,040
although it is very robust because

1074
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,760
people are still alive and what not but

1075
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,839
it seems like it is fairly easy to

1076
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,960
deregulate it seem like even like with

1077
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:15,880
addiction like what happens in in in

1078
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,839
terms of The calian rhythms in there it

1079
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,440
seems like it is not it it is modulated

1080
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,280
somewhere in there so that is something

1081
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,760
else to have in mind

1082
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,079
that pretty much is regulated yeah so

1083
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,280
thing with psychiatric disorders it's

1084
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,240
always like a chicken or egg scenario

1085
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,599
like are they having psychiatric

1086
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,359
disorders and their behavior is also

1087
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,559
disregulated their ccan Rhythm or is it

1088
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,640
dis Arcadian rhythm is disregulated and

1089
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,960
IND these things right and having an

1090
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,520
isolated system then helps you out to

1091
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,119
figure out which is the chicken or the

1092
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,400
egg right exactly so that is why these

1093
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:52,720
kind of systems are relevant for doing

1094
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,839
this very basic ESS here and there so

1095
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,960
yeah I I didn't know but that is

1096
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:58,640
something to keep in mind thank you and

1097
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,760
are you planning on a longitudinal

1098
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,960
long-term study and keeping your Organo

1099
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,920
as long as you can to see how

1100
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:10,200
disregulated time and age causes changes

1101
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:13,160
1,00% 1,000% so for instance in my

1102
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,359
previous lab it we were leaving cortical

1103
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:20,119
organs over a year to have a good model

1104
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:23,400
for what we would like call

1105
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:26,160
aging um so that is something that

1106
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,079

we just set up is that there are too

1116
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:53,440
many interesting questions that we can't

1118
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:00,240
much as we can

1119
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:02,200
