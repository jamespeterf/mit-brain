lecturesship. Uh, Professor Lewis

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,479
exemplifies in so many ways the spirit

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,960
of Millie Drestle House, our beloved

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,079
Millie uh, who was the pioneer in the

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,600
approach to materials research and who

35
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,360
bridged fundamental science and

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
transformative technology in her own

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
work.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,079
Milliey's groundbreaking work indeed is

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,560
well known and a groundbreaking work of

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,720
Professor Lewis in 3D printing and

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,119
bioinspired materials continues that

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,680
legacy.

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,000
I am honored to indeed invite her to

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,360
join me up here and indeed deliver the

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,360
dress house lecture. Welcome.

46
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,560
>> Thank you so much.

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,560
>> Thank you so much.

48
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,560
>> Well, I'd like to begin by by thanking

49
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,840
Vladimir. When he called me um to extend

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,520
the invitation, I said yes immediately.

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
And for many people who know me,

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,440
speaking in public is actually not my

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
favorite thing to do, but I I couldn't

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,440
pass up a chance to really honor uh

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,400
Millie Drestle House. Um we all know her

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,560
as an exceptional scholar, teacher, and

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,440
mentor, but I have to say for me at MIT,

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,040
she was a role model.

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,360
I came to MIT roughly 40 years ago as a

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,720
graduate student in uh material science

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,640
in course three and pretty early on

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,640
walking the infinite corridor back and

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,000
forth on a daily basis I came across

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,400
Professor Drestle House and she always

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,879
had a cardigan on and typically it was

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,599
red. There was that exact cardigan and

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,480
she was weighted down with two heavy

68
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,560
tote bags full of work and hustling,

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
always hustling. And I didn't know who

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360
she was at first, but she absolutely

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
captivated my attention. And of course

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
after those first few weeks of seeing

73
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,879
her in the hallway, I became aware of

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,440
who she was, who Professor Professor

75
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,400
Millie Drestle House was, that she was a

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,959
force, that she was really a leader in

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,159
in material science in in condensed

78
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,200
matter physics. And you know, I have to

79
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,799
say beyond beyond that, she's had a a

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,159
large impact on my career. So, first I I

81
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,159
have to say as a as a PhD student back

82
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,840
at that time when there were very few

83
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,400
female PhD students, uh let alone female

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,280
faculty, just seeing someone of her

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,159
stature and being able to have these

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,319
sightings in the hallway was really an

87
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,080
inspiration to me. And then subsequently

88
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,439
when I became a faculty member at the

89
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,280
University of Illinois um I ultimately

90
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,320
led the materials research lab there

91
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,560
which was heavily funded by DOEBS and

92
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
Millie Drestle House was really a legend

93
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
at DOE. She actually served as the

94
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,440
director of the office of science for

95
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,320
some time and having her support and

96
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,280
mentorship in my role as MRL director

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,600
also made a huge impact uh on my

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,560
professional development. So that's

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,160
really my tie to Millie and uh I thank

100
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,720
her very much for all that she's done

101
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,199
for her amazing inspiration both as a

102
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,639
student as a faculty member and even now

103
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,160
today now many of you might look at this

104
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,440
building and wonder what the heck is

105
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,840
that? That's the old building 12. So I

106
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,919
do have a tie to MIT Nano in a very

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,759
loose way. Um you see this uh lab right

108
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,520
there was where I did my own PhD

109
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
research. many years ago. We called that

110
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,440
the fishbowl because people would walk

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
down the sidewalk and looking at us. We

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
kind of felt like we were fish in a

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,600
tank, if you will. Um, but it was an

114
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,600
amazing time. Um, in this period of of

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
four years, um, high temperature

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,360
superconductivity was discovered. Um,

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
and 3D printing was really born and that

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,440
was born out of a collaboration between

119
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,160
Ellie Sachs in mechanical engineering

120
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,600
and my PhD adviser, Michael Sema. And

121
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,600
they really coined the term

122
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,120
three-dimensional printing. And of

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
course there are myriad methods and

124
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,520
we'll talk a little bit about that in a

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,600
moment. Um but from that lab of course

126
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,160
um we we have uh MIT Nano now and what a

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,479
fantastic building. I was in there today

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,320
and I was reminded as I saw the people

129
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,639
working in the clean room in their bunny

130
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,960
suits that actually my last year as a

131
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,520
PhD student I dawned the bunny suit many

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,400
times working uh to create very

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,199
primitive micrfluidic devices um in

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,280
Raphael Reich's lab. So I have a tie to

135
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:10,319
MIT Nano, not only in location, but also

136
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,160
uh in in in in reality. Um, but of

137
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
course uh back in the day I was working

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
on devices that were far less

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,280
sophisticated than the amazing things

140
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,680
that you guys are building now using

141
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,319
that facility. And I want to give a big

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,479
shout out to Vladimir and all those that

143
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
really contributed to realizing this

144
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,120
vision because it's had a huge impact on

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,280
the MIT community at large.

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,319
So the last thing I want to say before I

147
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,319
dive in is to just recognize that a

148
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,479
statement by Millie that says if you

149
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,960
don't have material you don't have an

150
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,720
experiment. So as a material scientist

151
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
of course that's the kind of exactly the

152
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,400
kind of thing we want to hear right

153
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,880
without materials there are there is no

154
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,280
engineering right so um with that in

155
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,600
mind let's think about um how as a

156
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
material scientists I was drawn into 3D

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,360
printing of course I said it was

158
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,759
happening in in the lab in the ecosystem

159
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,599
I was a graduate student in but I really

160
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,160
didn't start working in in this field

161
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,479
until I left and started my own lab and

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,520
then I took a different approach to the

163
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,759
binder printing on on a powder said, but

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,120
as a material scientist around the same

165
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,919
time in 1990, there was an NAS study

166
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
focusing on the materials paradigm and

167
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,319
MERT funings led this study and there

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,800
was a big decal report and it really

169
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,720
made this connection that how you make a

170
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
material affects its structure and it

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,280
affects its properties. And from that

172
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,919
perspective, it was a light bulb moment

173
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,800
for me to think about 3D printing beyond

174
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,800
just prototyping and making shapes, but

175
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
really being able to control local

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
composition structure and properties

177
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,000
across multiple scales. But that also

178
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
necessitated some advances in 3D

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,319
printing. If we think about the kinds of

180
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,039
methods that are exist, you know, it's

181
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,720
ubiquitous now, but 30 plus years ago,

182
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,800
it was still pretty primitive. The

183
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,039
earliest embodiment of these printing

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,960
modalities were really good at just

185
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,800
shaping material. There wasn't really

186
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,879
functional materials coming out of these

187
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,479
printers. Um, and in the meantime, of

188
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,280
course, the field has advanced across

189
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,759
many axes. Lightbased patterning is now

190
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,479
making things like our midsoles for for

191
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,240
running shoes. Um, we've got binder, you

192
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,400
know, printing and laser fusion making

193
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,560
metal parts for high-end fuel jet

194
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,120
injectors for things that are being used

195
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,599
commercially. um extrusion based methods

196
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,680
like uh FDM and and a technique that

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,080
we've helped advance direct ink writing

198
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,479
and then inkjet printing uh directly

199
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,360
where you're directly printing jettable

200
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,159
materials that could be UV cur cured and

201
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,479
so all of these methods I think are are

202
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,880
important but what we tried to do uh

203
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,160
early on in this process was really

204
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,640
bring in more function so integrate not

205
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,200
just form but function in 3D printed

206
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,160
components and that really required ired

207
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,640
a lot of uh effort across many years to

208
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,200
develop principal materials to develop

209
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,760
um many components and I'll highlight a

210
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,560
few things today in in the time that I

211
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,080
have basically advances that we've made

212
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,800
across printing platforms across print

213
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,040
path planning algorithms to basically

214
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,040
you know design uh through inverse

215
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,200
design and graph-based tool planning how

216
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,760
we can optimize the print path

217
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,519
themselves multimaterial print heads so

218
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,920
we can integrate functional materials

219
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,480
with structural materials and so forth.

220
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,320
And then really I think at the core of

221
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,880
this coming back to this you need

222
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
materials part is we developed this a

223
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,160
really a broad array of visco elastic

224
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,399
inks and matrices that can be printable

225
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,120
and that opened up a lot of the examples

226
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,320
that you saw on that last slide. So

227
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,080
let's start with just some of the

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
printing platforms that we've developed.

229
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
These are extrusionbased methods. The

230
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
nice thing about these methods, I think,

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,560
from the perspective of being able to

232
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,279
use these in in research capacity to

233
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,600
advance research is that they're very

234
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,360
amendable to a broad range of

235
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
functional, structural, and biological

236
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,760
materials. They're really modular ink

237
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,519
designs. You can plug and play multiple

238
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,839
types of building blocks into these

239
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,000
inks. And you can see, for example, here

240
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,080
in direct writing, this is a filamentary

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
process. So these materials are being

242
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,399
extruded. They're visco elastic in

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,160
nature. We also developed a process

244
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,399
called embedded 3D printing where

245
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,320
instead of printing everything, we can

246
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,320
mold some of the components and only

247
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,959
print the functional features. This is

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,760
actually a vascular tree. This was very

249
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,399
early on uh back in 2011 where we did

250
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,640
this work, but it really led to us also

251
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,279
then moving away from hydrogel

252
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,839
ascellular matrices to densely cellular

253
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,000
matrices where you can embed vascule

254
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,959
into human tissue. And we call that

255
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,320
approach swift uh sacrificial writing in

256
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,240
functional tissue. So with that in mind

257
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,640
then we also developed different

258
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,399
algorithms for controlling print path.

259
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,720
And one of the ones that recently came

260
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,360
out of our lab is called arrow. And the

261
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,600
idea here is when you are printing these

262
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
kinds of embedded printing modalities

263
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,959
there's a lot of starts and stops where

264
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
you're moving the nozzle in and out of

265
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,720
the matrix. And you really want to

266
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
minimize those starts and stops and you

267
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,880
also want to minimize the disruption to

268
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,000
the other printed features. So this is a

269
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,000
very simple graph uh graph theory based

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,640
approach where you can see that it

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
speeds up the time for printing.

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,399
Now complimentary to that we've also

273
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,720
developed a number of nozzles and

274
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,079
printing modalities that all rely on

275
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,760
these same types of materials but either

276
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,360
you know using switching and

277
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,079
multi-noszle uh arrays to do voxillated

278
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,360
printing on demand or these adaptive

279
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,000
nozzles that can go over um nonlinear uh

280
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
kurolinear substrates or a rotational

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
print head that can bring multiple

282
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
materials into a single filament to be

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,160
able to even give you something like

284
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,920
subboxating control.

285
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,079
So at the heart of all of this of course

286
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,760
is the materials and how do we develop

287
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,399
these materials? They have to have this

288
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,360
appropriate visco elastic response in

289
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,160
order to have this ability to flow when

290
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,320
their sheer yield stress is exceeded

291
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
during the printing process. But then as

292
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
they exit the nozzle in a quesuscent

293
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,320
state they become rapidly solidike. We

294
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,399
do most of our printing at room

295
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,839
temperature. We're not relying on any

296
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,839
kind of um external fields to to uh

297
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
solidify these materials. We're really

298
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,760
just relying on the inherent visco

299
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,600
elasticity of the of the inks in the

300
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,600
matrices.

301
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,920
Now, we also worked very closely with

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,240
Howard Stone's lab to look at the design

303
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,480
of the visco elastic matrices for

304
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,320
embedded printing. What are the key

305
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,200
components and considerations as you're

306
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,720
moving a nozzle through a matrix? How do

307
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,120
you avoid um uh locally yielding printed

308
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,959
features that are uh surrounding the

309
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,360
filaments that you've already printed?

310
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,279
And so here we under we unraveled the

311
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,440
role of the sheer yield stress and the

312
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,600
printing speed and how one can tailor

313
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,000
that to enhance the fidelity of the

314
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,920
printing process itself. And that leads

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,480
to the kinds of lises that you can see

316
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,680
here where um we can print in three

317
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,240
dimensions very complex architectures.

318
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,120
So, from the perspective of of materials

319
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
and inks and matrices, um, as I said,

320
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,880
these are really plug-and-play kinds of

321
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,839
modular designs. And I'm going to

322
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,560
highlight just three examples in the

323
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,639
context of of various applications. Work

324
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,200
that we've done really early on in

325
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,519
developing particle-based inks based on

326
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,480
the gellation of colloidal particles,

327
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,560
hydrogel based inks, and um these

328
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,880
granular building blocks that that serve

329
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,880
as matrices for engineering of

330
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,560
vascularized human tissues. In this

331
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
case, you're looking at cardiac

332
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,200
spheroids that have been derived from

333
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,839
human IPS cells. Um and these are

334
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,760
multisellular aggregates.

335
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,399
Now putting this into context, I'm a

336
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,000
material scientist. Roughly 12 years ago

337
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,959
when I moved to Harvard, we opened up

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,959
our lab in bioprinting and in biology.

339
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,839
And I had to kind of learn the language

340
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:05,199
of the biologists. So I'm coming at it

341
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,800
from knowing this very well particles,

342
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,480
aggregates, gilation, polymers, etc. But

343
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,519
how do I make the connection in my own

344
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,040
mind and then more broadly here to the

345
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,360
kinds of building blocks that we think

346
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,040
about on the living side? Well, we can

347
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
kind of think in our own minds about

348
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,920
particles being like cells and

349
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,560
aggregates being like multisellular

350
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,720
aggregates and then polymers that we

351
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,399
might use for scaffolds and other things

352
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
are kind of like the extracellular

353
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
matrices that support the cells

354
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,120
themselves. And ultimately when we want

355
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,720
to write pneumatic networks for say soft

356
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,480
robots or blood vessels for for tissues,

357
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
we need some sort of sacrificial

358
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,720
material that we can erase that will

359
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,880
leave behind these channels. And so

360
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,199
that's important for both uh types of

361
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,760
modalities.

362
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,199
I won't go into all the details here,

363
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,279
but this really kind of captures um many

364
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,399
many experiments that we've done over

365
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,720
over a decade plus of time where we're

366
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,040
tuning realology and we're also trying

367
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,600
to tune the resolidification part. How

368
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,639
do we keep those inks that come out of

369
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
the nozzle in a filamentary form in in

370
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,240
that form so that they don't wet and

371
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,639
spread? How can we ensure that they

372
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,480
resolidify, that they stay in place,

373
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,120
that we can build layers on top of them

374
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,360
and they don't sag or deform? And there

375
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,240
are many types of of modalities that

376
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,560
we've of of that we've uh really

377
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
employed, including just reversible

378
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,199
yielding, thermre reversible phase

379
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,279
transitions. In some cases, we've had to

380
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,199
rely on photopolymerization or thermal

381
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,519
curing. But in general, this

382
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,600
reversibility to the yielding process is

383
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,120
inherent in these visco elastic

384
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,680
materials. And that's what we've really

385
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,759
tried to exploit predominantly.

386
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,240
So I want to take a step back to sort of

387
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,800
the beginning because I think it's nice

388
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,959
to see the cont as a context where we

389
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,560
started and this is work that we started

390
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,680
actually in collaboration with Joseph

391
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,320
Ceserano at Sandia and a talented PhD

392
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,800
student Jim Smay helped to lead. Um and

393
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,199
here we recognized that we could print

394
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,000
these particle gels. So just particles

395
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,079
suspended in water. And as long as we

396
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,920
were at high solids loading and we made

397
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,079
these particles attractive enough so

398
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,560
that they could basically exhibit this

399
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,199
visco elastic response, we could print

400
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,920
these uh with high fidelity. And the

401
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,000
only knob we had to turn was the pH. And

402
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,079
we used that as an adjustment to adjust

403
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the particle attraction strength between

404
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,360
the particles. And you can see that when

405
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,480
they become uh sticky enough, you have a

406
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,720
very high uh sheer yield uh modulus. So

407
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,720
that can be self-supporting and a high

408
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,480
sheer yield stress. And they form this

409
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,279
sort of spanning clusters in

410
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,279
three-dimensional space. Now, we can use

411
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,279
things like confocal microscopy to

412
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,120
really understand what's happening to

413
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,199
these building blocks as they're flowing

414
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,079
through a nozzle. In this case, it's a

415
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,079
simple micrfluidic nozzle that mimics a

416
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,720
print head. And what you're looking at

417
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,199
is this in this square here is this

418
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,079
feature in the turndown ratio between

419
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,760
the nozzle exit and the ink reservoir.

420
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,839
And you can see these clusters. The

421
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,079
highest shear is at the wall and they

422
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,679
start to break apart, right? But the

423
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,199
minute they exit the nozzle, they all

424
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,679
stick together again. And that's why

425
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,360
they're able to support themselves. And

426
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
you can see that they can support

427
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,199
themselves across large gaps in the

428
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,839
underlying layers. So we can create

429
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,160
these lattis-like structures without a

430
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,640
support material. And in fact, you can

431
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,760
span very large features with these uh

432
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,760
extruded inks. Um and here again, we're

433
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,480
tailoring this G prime, the sheer

434
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,720
elastic modulus. The higher that value,

435
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,320
the longer the span distance that these

436
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,840
materials can can go without sagging or

437
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,520
deforming.

438
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,919
And that's important for kinds of things

439
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
that we did in printed electronics. So

440
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
this is actually a filament being

441
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,760
printed out of plane through a 30 micron

442
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,400
nozzle. The step height here is 1

443
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,720
millimeter. So this is over a very long

444
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,200
long gap. And we've tailored these

445
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,280
materials to be able to do that without

446
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,679
without um def you know any kind of

447
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,640
deformation. And you can see that with

448
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,280
these nanoparticle constituents here

449
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,000
it's a silver nanoparticle system that

450
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,480
we can print through nozzles as fine as

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,880
one micron the pattern one micron

452
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,000
electrodes and that's in plane this is

453
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,760
30 microns out of plane and with that

454
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,039
then we can make some you know

455
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,600
functional devices like these inductors

456
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,600
planer solenoid and tooidal inductors

457
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,480
shown here and you can see this is an

458
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,039
inplane modality coming out to to a

459
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,799
contact pad. And these are the the coils

460
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,919
of this inductor. And again, this is

461
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,360
about a 10 micron resolution.

462
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,039
And we can do something a bit more

463
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,000
sophisticated. And this is work that we

464
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,080
did with Don Hei Ham several years ago.

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,640
And this gives you a sense of the scale.

466
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,960
These are the devices here shown. Uh

467
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,960
this is a coits oscillator, four

468
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,200
oscillators that are synchronized. And

469
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,120
this is a wireless transmitter. And this

470
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,760
one's actually on polyimid, but you can

471
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,600
get a size scale associated with this,

472
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,320
right? So, we can basically print the

473
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,400
electronics on demand.

474
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,120
And with this, because this is a modular

475
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,280
ink design, we can plug and play. We can

476
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,880
re replace any type of particle with a

477
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,640
different particle. So, one of the

478
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,880
things that kind of really caught

479
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,039
attention about a decade ago was the

480
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,200
fact that we were making these uh 3D

481
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,360
printed micro batteries that are lithium

482
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,919
ion based and rechargeable where we have

483
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,240
interdigitated cathodes and anodess. And

484
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,080
you can see the size scale here. Each

485
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,880
one of these batteries is about the size

486
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,360
of a single grain of sand. And we've

487
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,600
done other uh modalities here where we

488
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
can create foam based materials. So we

489
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,840
can take these gels and we can airate

490
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,080
them and have lightweight architectures

491
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,520
where now you have a large amount of

492
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,440
bubbles within the ink itself. And then

493
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,840
we can also create these um chain

494
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,280
mail-like structures uh using embedded

495
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
printing of these same kinds of

496
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,080
colloidal inks.

497
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,400
So that led us to sort of the next class

498
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,200
of materials that we developed which are

499
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,840
based on polymers. And here we've done a

500
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,320
broad array of polymer designs um both

501
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,960
for matrices and for inks starting with

502
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,240
some of the earliest work where we just

503
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
essentially said well we're using

504
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
polyelerolytes to stabilize particles

505
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,679
maybe we should just take the particles

506
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
out and start working with the

507
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,559
polyelerolytes themselves. It was sort

508
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,799
of like that simple of a concept. And

509
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,400
here we did some very nice work where we

510
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,720
were working with these oppositely

511
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
charged polyelerolytes that could print

512
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,120
through nozzles as small as like 500

513
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,360
nmters in diameter because these are

514
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,840
fine scale building blocks. And then we

515
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,640
build upon that to move to hydrogels,

516
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,840
elastimemers and thermosets. And then we

517
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,080
used um fillers both as functional moes

518
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,000
as well as realological aids to make

519
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,600
these kinds of polymer materials

520
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,919
printable.

521
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,880
And so one of the things that I think

522
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,919
we've pioneered is this concept of 4D

523
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,960
printing. Um and Skyler Tidbitz here at

524
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,679
MIT has also uh helped coin that that

525
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,919
phrase as well. Um but the idea is that

526
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,840
you 3D print in three dimensions but if

527
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,240
these structures shape morph then

528
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,039
there's an added dimension of time. So

529
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,360
hence the terminology 4D printing. Um

530
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,360
but we took inspiration from nature when

531
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,480
we started thinking about how to realize

532
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,880
this uh in practice. And so if we think

533
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,440
about the nastic motion of plants,

534
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,240
plants undergo dramatic shape changes in

535
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,039
response to touch changes in thermal uh

536
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,280
conditions or in just hydration. So

537
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,080
these are uh pine cones and wheatons

538
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,080
that are billayer architectures. So with

539
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:51,120
this kind of uh uh modality in mind we

540
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,520
focused on printing hydrogels but we

541
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,000
wanted to introduce cellulose fibrals

542
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,919
because if we look at plant cell walls

543
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,559
that's exactly what leads to these

544
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:04,000
anisotropic shape morphing responses.

545
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:07,679
You have stiff cellulose fibers wrapping

546
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,760
around a hydrogel um outer shell and

547
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,320
that essentially guides the shape

548
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,720
morphing. you have less shape morphing

549
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,039
uh in you have less shape change in the

550
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,760
direction uh parallel to the stiff

551
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,480
features and more accommodated in the

552
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,880
orthogonal direction. So we can use the

553
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,200
shear fields in the nozzle during

554
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,840
printing to essentially control the

555
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,440
alignment of these rigid or stiff

556
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,760
fillers. And so if we can guide that uh

557
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,720
alignment we can then lead to a

558
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,720
programmed shape change. And so we did

559
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,400
this and this was work actually with uh

560
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,840
Maha at Harvard and also with Ralph Niso

561
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,919
um at Illinois. Um, we, it was really as

562
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,600
we were, as I was leaving, uh, Illinois

563
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,000
that Ralph and I started brainstorming

564
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,039
about this whole concept of 3D of 4D

565
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,440
printing. And then Skyler came out with

566
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,000
a big talk that announced that term. And

567
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,000
I was like, but nevertheless, we still

568
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
got we still got pretty excited about

569
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,960
uh, realizing that goal. And so these

570
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,640
are just hydrogel materials that again

571
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,280
we have these stiff cellulose

572
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,799
microfibals in. And simply by changing

573
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,679
the bilayer uh geometry this angle here

574
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,320
we can uh programmably define both the

575
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,400
Gaussian and mean curvature and we can

576
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,640
take our measured parameters for the

577
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,880
swelling strain uh along the um parallel

578
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,360
and orthogonal print paths and the

579
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
elastic moduli that we observe. And we

580
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,600
can relate that stiffness anisotropy

581
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,640
that we encode into these printed

582
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,480
materials to their swelling anisotropy.

583
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,720
And with that then we can do very

584
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,880
complex architecture such as this

585
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,799
callilly for example which has

586
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,120
continuous changes in both mean and

587
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,159
gaussian curvature. And the predicted

588
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,640
path uh print path from this model um

589
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,440
which is based on inverse design leads

590
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,240
to a planer structure that when it shape

591
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,039
morphs goes into essentially that exact

592
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,760
mo motif of the callilly. And so with

593
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,000
that in mind then we asked ourselves you

594
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,320
know can we extend this to other types

595
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,600
of filler materials again modular ink

596
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,240
designs can we can we control the

597
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,120
alignment of anotropic stiff building

598
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,640
blocks can we do that even when they're

599
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,880
rigid misogens rather than say nano uh

600
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,960
rods or uh short you know fiberfilled uh

601
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,400
structures and the and the answer is yes

602
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,960
we can we can really tailor and and and

603
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,760
program in a stiffness gradient in these

604
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,120
structures. Even when the the features

605
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,440
that we're printing are along a main

606
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,159
chain of just having rigid spacing

607
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,799
elements like liquid crystal mis

608
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,440
misogens and so with that we did a

609
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:57,600
variety of motifs um shown here and um I

610
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,679
think you know we I think are continuing

611
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,480
to explore how we can leverage shape

612
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,919
morphing in both these kinds of contexts

613
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,480
but also in in tissue engineering.

614
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,400
And so that kind of brings me to I would

615
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:16,240
say the last example. And here the the

616
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:20,480
idea is that um we wanted to uh think

617
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,440
about vascule and what we you know rely

618
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,159
on and and use vascule in natural

619
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,880
systems to do. Um when we think about

620
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,400
leafination or the vascule that we have

621
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
in our bodies and our organs and

622
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,080
throughout they're bringing nutrients uh

623
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,640
to the cells. They are regulating

624
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,120
temperature and in some cases they're

625
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,200
participating of course in healing local

626
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,760
damage. And our first foray into uh

627
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,240
creating vascularized materials was

628
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,080
really in the context of soft materials.

629
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,720
We were working very closely with

630
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,520
colleagues at Illinois before moving to

631
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,919
Harvard in both printing 3D micrfluidic

632
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,640
devices and also a class of materials

633
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,559
known as self-healing materials. And in

634
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,240
the original embodiment for self-healing

635
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,919
materials, there were micro capsules

636
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,120
that were distributed in a polymer

637
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,039
matrix. But when you broke that um when

638
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,679
you broke that material, those capsules

639
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,480
would release healing agent in the ca in

640
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,919
this case in the form of monomer. But

641
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,840
once that region that had been broken um

642
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,679
was rehealed, it couldn't be broken

643
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,600
again because all those capsules would

644
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,559
have drained and they couldn't supply

645
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,039
new healing agent. And so Scott White, a

646
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,320
pioneer in self-healing materials along

647
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,240
with Nancy Sodto and Jeff Moore, um

648
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,120
started collaborating with our lab to

649
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,159
basically print these vascularized uh

650
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,919
embodiment uh so that just like our

651
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,159
blood continuously flows through our

652
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,640
body, we could have a continuous supply

653
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,159
of healing agents uh in these uh

654
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,960
materials. But as we kind of came to

655
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,440
fruition and realized that goal, it

656
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,200
opened up in my own mind applications

657
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,679
that were far beyond that uh example,

658
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,799
including areas of soft robotics where

659
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,679
now we could encode into the material

660
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,840
that we're building, pneumatic networks.

661
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,559
And of course, opening up a field of

662
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,640
tissue and whole organ engineering,

663
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,080
which is really at the leading edge and

664
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,760
something that our lab has helped

665
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,080
contribute to.

666
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,960
So the very first work in this space was

667
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,720
done by Willie Woo um in my lab at

668
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,760
Illinois and he developed this concept

669
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,159
of you know embedded printing and the

670
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
reason why he did that is because

671
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,520
because of course when you're using a

672
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,600
direct write approach you're just going

673
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,840
layer by layer and if we want to create

674
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,480
a true three-dimensional vascularized

675
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,679
network um we want to be able to print

676
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,600
in a free form way in three dimensions

677
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,320
and so this really led led to this

678
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,640
advance and he developed not only a

679
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,720
sacrificial ink but a soft matrix and

680
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,520
this was just a hydrogel matrix at the

681
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,000
time that would enable us to print these

682
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,840
complex levels of vascule and what

683
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,159
you're seeing here is a vascular tree

684
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,240
with an inlet and outlet that follows

685
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,240
Murray's law for those of you who do

686
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,120
work in the biology realm you know that

687
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,799
Murray's law controls basically the the

688
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,159
size scale of your uh vessels as they go

689
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,159
to ever uh uh smaller daughter branches

690
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,200
in such a way that it sets the

691
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,320
dimensions of the large parent vessel as

692
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,640
it goes down to the smaller uh vessels.

693
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,960
So with that in mind then um it was kind

694
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,960
of a light bulb moment for me. We hadn't

695
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,760
really been working on cells in our lab

696
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,399
before that time, but I realized that at

697
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,200
that time that was like a real roadblock

698
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,240
in the field of tissue engineering and

699
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,960
we might have now an a way to actually

700
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,000
address that roadblock if only our lab

701
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,480
could start working with cells and um so

702
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,720
it co happened to coincide with the

703
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,399
opportunity to move to Harvard to do

704
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,840
just that. Um but at Harvard we ended up

705
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,240
doing a little bit more than just

706
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,080
working on the biological side. We also

707
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,159
started teaming with colleagues in soft

708
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,279
robotics. So I'll first describe a

709
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,440
little bit of the work that we've done

710
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,679
to leverage this method for soft

711
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,399
robotics and then I'll talk about what

712
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,720
we're doing in the uh area of of tissue

713
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,000
and organ engineering.

714
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,880
So the the whole key behind this uh

715
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,799
process is engineering a sacrificial ink

716
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,960
that will undergo a thermal reversible

717
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,799
phase change going from something that's

718
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,120
a gel to a fluid uh at at a prescribed

719
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,880
temperature change. And we have two

720
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,679
basic inks that we've developed for

721
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,000
doing this. One is a synthetic hydrogel.

722
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,799
It's a triblock copolymer. It's actually

723
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,559
made by BASF. You can buy it. It's

724
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,039
typically used as a thickener, an

725
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,640
associative thickener. Um, but it melts

726
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,799
upon cooling. And that's kind of

727
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,640
unusual. Most times when you melt

728
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,559
something, you have to heat it up. But

729
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,799
the reason it melts upon cooling is that

730
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,720
it's it's controlled the gel the gel

731
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,200
itself is controlled by hydrophobic

732
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,000
interactions of these blocks that are

733
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,679
poor rich, polyropylene oxide rich, and

734
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,240
the cores are a polyethylene oxide. But

735
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,279
as we as we cool this down, the

736
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,320
hydrophobic interactions lessen and the

737
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,559
myels basically get disrupted and you

738
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,360
have a low viscosity fluid. And when

739
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,919
it's cool, this is when we can actually

740
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,159
evacuate the printed features in order

741
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,320
to open up the channels that we want

742
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,640
running through these structures. Now,

743
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,440
we can also do this in biological uh

744
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,320
gels such as gelatin. This one of course

745
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,640
uh is cool at room temperature and um uh

746
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,720
becomes I mean I'm sorry is cool at low

747
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,840
temperature and becomes a fluid as we

748
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,279
heat above uh roughly room temperature.

749
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,120
And so if we're thinking about printing

750
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,120
a tissue construct when we put that

751
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,200
tissue into an incubator at 37° C this

752
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,600
fluidizes and we can flush that out and

753
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,080
start perfusing the tissue construct. So

754
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,760
these two very simple concepts and

755
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,600
materials formulations are things that

756
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,039
we've used for both printing soft

757
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,559
robotics and human tissues. And so one

758
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,640
of the earliest things that we did in

759
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,120
the soft robotics area in collaboration

760
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,679
with Rob Wood and and benefiting from

761
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,320
some beautiful work also um from George

762
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,799
Whiteside's lab on these uh fluidic

763
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,080
logic circuits was to create a fully

764
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,440
soft robot that operated autonomously.

765
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,960
So the this robot embodies both this

766
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,159
micrfluidic logic but it also embodies

767
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,559
the energy source. So as we build this

768
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,960
you can see that it's in a mold and only

769
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,200
these features shown in red here and

770
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,840
also the reaction chambers which are a

771
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,960
platinum catalyzed uh components that

772
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,640
are sitting here in dark um are are

773
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,279
printed by the embedded printing

774
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,200
process. Everything else is molded. But

775
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,279
sitting in the middle here is a logic

776
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,159
circuit that's shown here. And that

777
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,240
operates as follows. So it has an

778
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,360
oscillating circuit that basically

779
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,519
guides um the fuel which is sitting in

780
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,000
the depot back in the in the back of the

781
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,080
the robot and it's delivering hydrogen

782
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,880
peroxide. And as it moves through the

783
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,360
oscillating circuit um in every

784
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,480
oscillation either the the top or bottom

785
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,960
part of this robot hits the platinum uh

786
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,120
the the platinum catalyst where it

787
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
becomes uh vapor where it becomes vapor.

788
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,039
So it becomes water vapor and oxygen and

789
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,440
that is what is inflating um these robot

790
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,480
arms. So this is basically inspired by

791
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,039
an octopus. We called it the octabot. Um

792
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,039
and you can see the fuel depot here. the

793
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,679
fluids moving through the circuit and

794
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,880
the opposing arms going up and down as

795
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,840
it they inflate and deflate. Now we we

796
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,360
built upon this in another way which was

797
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,360
to in include not only the fluidic

798
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,399
circuitry by by printing these

799
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,919
sacrificial inks but to also build in a

800
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:05,200
sensorized network a smatensory feedback

801
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,039
into these um robotic grippers. So each

802
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,760
one of these is like a finger in a

803
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,960
robotic gripper. But now this finger is

804
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,159
like our own human fingers. It can sense

805
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,640
uh kesthetically uh with proprioception

806
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,480
and also in a tactile way. And here

807
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,240
we're printing ion gels and we're

808
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,039
measuring basically changes in

809
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,760
resistance as we're operating the device

810
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,679
in order to give sensory feedback. And

811
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,120
you can see that it's a fairly complex

812
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,200
design. The bladders are are here. Those

813
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,919
are the ones that are being printed by

814
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,880
using the sacrificial ink for inflation.

815
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,039
And everything shown in red is a sensor

816
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,080
um that is either going to sense

817
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,440
curvature in this case, sense tactile

818
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,159
tacticity with a contact sensor or a

819
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,480
small amount of of a of an inflation

820
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,960
center sensor that basically says are

821
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,519
the bladders being filled or unfilled as

822
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,600
we're activating the the gripper. And

823
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,320
this is what it looks like in action.

824
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,080
So, this is just a three-finger gripper.

825
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,519
You can start to see the readouts from

826
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,839
each one of these sensors that are

827
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,800
embedded in these fingers. Um, they all

828
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,320
look like this in uh, you know, under UV

829
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,520
illumination, but this is what it looks

830
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,359
like in uh, natural light. Um, and so

831
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,480
you can see very nicely that we have the

832
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,879
ability then to basically introduce uh,

833
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,599
sensory feedback into these, you know,

834
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,919
simple elastor siliconebased elastimemer

835
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,240
architectures.

836
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,079
And so I guess the last thing I wanted

837
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,000
to just highlight um is our our work

838
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,639
that we're now doing to try to build

839
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,960
human tissues um starting with patient

840
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,440
specific cells. So starting with you

841
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,639
know human induced puropotent stem cells

842
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,720
which we can then um uh leverage and

843
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,879
differentiate into um any essentially uh

844
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,320
organ type of interest. We've been

845
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,520
primarily working on cardiac um kidney

846
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,640
and uh cerebral tissue and we've been

847
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,680
motivated by two major needs. Uh one is

848
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,320
in the organ on chips uh space to

849
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,320
understand uh and and and search for

850
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,599
drugs through drug testing and disease

851
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,480
modeling. Essentially a fail zero a fail

852
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,880
a phase zero fail fast trial carried out

853
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,400
on human tissues as opposed to animal

854
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,119
models. And the FDA just had a uh FDA

855
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,200
modernization act 2.0 which is really

856
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,359
driving the development of these types

857
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,400
of models. Um and we've been really

858
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,280
focusing on 3D uh versions of this. So

859
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,760
rather than cellular monollayers in a in

860
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,920
a chip, we want either three-dimensional

861
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,440
tubular architectures such as kidney

862
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,400
proximal tubules or blood vessels or

863
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,359
organoids themselves underflow. And then

864
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,640
from the perspective of ultimately a a

865
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,280
sort of grand challenge goal is to

866
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,240
create these tissues for therapeutic use

867
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,400
and ultimately at the whole organ scale.

868
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,960
And the motivation behind that of course

869
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,960
is not only the pervasive need for hum

870
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,760
for human organs, people who have

871
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,200
diseases um such as chronic kidney

872
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,599
disease. Um that also even if you're

873
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,440
fortunate enough to get a donor organ,

874
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
you're going to be on immunosuppressants

875
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,240
the rest of your life. And that is not a

876
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,680
fun thing because it knocks down your

877
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,000
immune system. It makes you more

878
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,760
susceptible to cancer. And so the idea

879
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,720
is can we make tissues that are made

880
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,440
from you for you taking your own cells

881
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,359
reprogramming them to a pur potent state

882
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,920
and then differentiating them to

883
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:44,000
specific lineages of interest whether it

884
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:48,160
be kidney cardiac brain and reconstitute

885
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,920
those into a vascularized profusible

886
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,760
functional uh tissue and so here I want

887
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,560
to give a shout out to Mark Skyler Scott

888
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,119
who I think was just recently at MIT

889
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,280
giving a a lecture on his work uh in uh

890
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,079
the mechanical engineering course too

891
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,040
and to another pioneering postoc

892
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,760
Sabuzelle who really helped advance this

893
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,240
concept of of swift we call it

894
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,880
sacrificial writing in functional tissue

895
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,320
and the idea is just like we did to

896
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,400
engineer visco elastic matrices for um

897
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,200
embedded printing of functional and

898
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,240
structural materials we can take stem

899
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,640
cells

900
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,359
And in this case, we're taking them in

901
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,040
their plur potent state. So these

902
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,720
aggregates that you see are actually

903
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,960
embroidery bodies. They haven't been

904
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,359
differentiated to a specific lineage

905
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,640
yet. We can take these we can make them

906
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,680
in these um micro wells. We can so we

907
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,800
can make one EV per well and we have you

908
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,079
vast T flasks of these um in order to

909
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,359
create milliliters of tissue um at cell

910
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,000
densities that are approaching

911
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,800
biological cell densities of roughly 200

912
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,280
million cells per milliliter and then we

913
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,960
use our sacrificial writing method to

914
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,599
write in vascular uh uh perfusible

915
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,000
vascule. Of course everywhere you see

916
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,960
red is a is the gelatin ink that I

917
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,040
mentioned earlier. And then once we warm

918
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,880
that tissue up in the incubator, we can

919
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,720
flush away everything that you see in

920
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,880
red. There's an inlet and outlet pin

921
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,440
here, for example. And what we leave

922
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,920
behind are these open lumens. And

923
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,599
without these open lumens, this is a

924
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,440
4x4x4

925
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,760
mm cubed tissue. You see that inside

926
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,000
because these are cellularly dense, you

927
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,200
have a necrotic core. there's only a

928
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,880
very thin zone of viability that is in

929
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,599
contact with this uh the media uh around

930
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,079
this molded tissue. But if we introduce

931
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,240
vessels into this tissue, then we can

932
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,320
keep that entire 4 millimeter thick

933
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,720
tissue alive because we're profusing

934
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,720
media through these channels through

935
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,920
these essentially vessels. Now how this

936
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,320
works is that we take these uh embryoid

937
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,599
bodies or if we differentiate them into

938
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,160
specific lineages we jam them in a fluid

939
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,760
ECM. So initially they're sitting in a

940
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,000
liquid that is also thermmorreversible.

941
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,480
It's suspended in an extracellular

942
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,640
matrix that can be a fluid at the

943
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,839
printing temperature. But ultimately

944
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,760
when we um heat heat up the tissue both

945
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,560
this this ink liquefies but the the ECM

946
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,040
that's fluid becomes solid. So it

947
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,359
becomes like a glue and it holds all the

948
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,320
building blocks in place so that we can

949
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,880
empty the channels without disrupting

950
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,480
the the surrounding matrix. Without

951
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,560
that, of course, all those building

952
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,920
blocks would just flow into those

953
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,640
printed and then opened lumens.

954
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,440
So with that then we more recently and

955
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,440
and Paul's here in the audience um have

956
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,000
taken this a step further using a

957
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,200
technique called coaxial swift so that

958
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,720
we could really replicate the complex um

959
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,599
morphology of of human vessels where you

960
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,240
have a smooth muscle cell uh shell

961
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,040
wrapping uh an endothelium

962
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,800
endothelialized channels. And the the

963
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,680
trick to this, and you can't really see

964
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,960
it in this schematic, is that there's an

965
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,359
extended core that sticks out of this uh

966
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,800
core shell nozzle that is able to

967
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,359
puncture through preprinted uh

968
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,119
structures and connect them such that

969
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,440
you can have continuous um sacrificial

970
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,680
materials that uh can ultimately be

971
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,240
emptied and endothelialized to create

972
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,960
these vessels. And around each of these

973
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,160
are a smooth muscle layer that remains

974
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,400
viable over a multi-day period. And in

975
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,880
fact, these actually have a confluent

976
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,560
endothelium which exhibits high barrier

977
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,280
function which is what our own blood

978
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,760
vessels do as well. So with that as sort

979
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,960
of the background, we then wanted to

980
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,319
demonstrate a functional tissue uh

981
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,720
sample. And this is work um I think from

982
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,079
from several years ago, but it really

983
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,800
highlights I think in the most

984
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,119
compelling visual way that the tissue is

985
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,359
in fact functional. So although we're

986
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,400
working in on extending this now to

987
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,480
kidney tissues in in a substantial way,

988
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,640
I think this is actually a very good

989
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,680
embodiment because it shows in the um as

990
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,839
we differentiate these stem cells into

991
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,079
cardiac building blocks. In this case,

992
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,560
these are multisellular spheroids

993
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,280
roughly 400 microns in diameter. So they

994
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,839
contain many cells per little uh

995
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,240
building block. You can see that in the

996
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,560
post- differentiated state, each one of

997
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,760
these building blocks is beating, right?

998
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,359
It's beating, but it's beating

999
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,599
asynchronously.

1000
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,200
We take these building blocks and we jam

1001
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:54,480
them into a much more dense packing that

1002
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,520
can support our writing of functional uh

1003
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,680
writing of the uh vessels. And then with

1004
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,520
that at at at day one, you can see still

1005
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,280
each one of those little building blocks

1006
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,839
is is beating, but it's beating

1007
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,319
asynchronously. After seven days in

1008
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,880
culture, these building blocks fuse

1009
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,760
together and they become they become a

1010
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,160
contiguous tissue that actually beats

1011
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,800
synchronously. And uh what you're seeing

1012
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,280
here is a let me go to the next slide is

1013
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,520
a fluorescent uh intensity of a calcium

1014
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,000
indicator that essentially shows this

1015
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,640
spontaneous and they're beating under a

1016
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,520
spontaneous activity. Um and you can see

1017
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,119
that in looking at just like two regions

1018
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,800
in this tissue. Initially on day one

1019
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,760
they're all beating asynchronously.

1020
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,400
Nothing is is synchronized. After um day

1021
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,640
seven they are beating synchronously and

1022
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,880
we can pace these tissues at say one

1023
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,040
hertz and you can see that the entire

1024
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,440
bulk of the tissue is responding in

1025
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,160
unison and these are just two regions of

1026
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,400
the tissue one here and one sitting here

1027
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,880
that we were tracking.

1028
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,040
So with that one could also ask how do

1029
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,200
they respond to drugs? Um and they in

1030
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,200
fact do respond in a way that you would

1031
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,440
expect if we gave these drugs to

1032
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,400
ourselves. um we would expect that our

1033
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,480
beat frequency would accelerate and if

1034
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,280
we gave this drug we would expect that

1035
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,920
the amplitude of our cardiac output so

1036
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,160
that contractility would be dissipated

1037
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,480
and you can see that in fact as we

1038
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,400
peruse these drugs through these tissues

1039
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,119
we see in fact that same kind of output

1040
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,079
so with that well I guess I'll close by

1041
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,480
just saying where we're going is to kind

1042
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,839
of expand this not only to different

1043
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,280
tissue types

1044
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:44,240
but also building in uh mechanisms by

1045
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,240
which we can build multiscale vascule

1046
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,560
because these tissues are metabolically

1047
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,720
active. They're cellularly dense and the

1048
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,800
printed vascule alone may not be

1049
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,319
sufficient to keep these tissues alive

1050
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,079
over over long periods of of in vitro or

1051
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,400
invivo uh maturation. And so we're we

1052
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,920
have multiple strategies to vascularize

1053
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,000
organoids including using flow including

1054
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,640
using genetic uh programming to

1055
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,200
orthogonally induce multiple cell types

1056
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,920
in these tissues of prescribed uh cell

1057
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,880
type uh and then also of course our

1058
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,839
embedded and uh direct printing methods.

1059
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,760
So with that I'll just end by sum with

1060
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,839
this summary. I won't tell you what I've

1061
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,000
already told you, but I will end with

1062
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,079
something that I hope Millie would love

1063
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
is that I've modified her statement just

1064
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,680
a little bit to say that if you don't

1065
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,160
have printable materials, you don't have

1066
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,920
an experiment. And I think if if Millie

1067
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,560
was here, hopefully she would allow me

1068
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,720
that grace. Um, and uh, with that, I

1069
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,119
want to thank uh, a number of people

1070
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,040
over the years that have contributed um,

1071
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,400
to our lab, to the work that you've seen

1072
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,800
today. Um it really takes a village and

1073
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,640
uh many of these advances I have to give

1074
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,040
all the credit to the students and the

1075
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,040
postocs. It's really their creativity

1076
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,839
and their hard work that have brought

1077
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,319
these these ideas to fruition and I hope

1078
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,480
have made an impact in a positive way on

1079
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,160
the field of 3D printing and on the

1080
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,319
field of tissue engineering and soft

1081
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,960
robotics and and all the things that

1082
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,920
we've had I hope a small role in helping

1083
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,079
advance. Um, and I also, you might

1084
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,520
notice, uh, up here in the corner, this

1085
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,079
was a gathering that we had back in

1086
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,680
December. Um, my my adviser was also

1087
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,480
there, Michael Sema, and I want to give

1088
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,720
him a shout out because, you know, as a

1089
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,280
as a PhD student, I learned so much from

1090
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,480
him. And, um, we've remained friends to

1091
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,839
this day. And, um, I as his first PhD

1092
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,240
student, I always say I went through

1093
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,400
tenure twice,

1094
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,839
but really once I once I realized what

1095
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,560
tenure was, like, no, I didn't.

1096
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,640
he he bore all the pressure, not me. But

1097
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,960
uh but it was it was a lot of fun. And

1098
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,119
and um uh with that, I'll thank a number

1099
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,240
of agencies that have funded our our

1100
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,040
work. And um lastly, I want to dedicate

1101
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,079
this to Millie Drestell House, who, as I

1102
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,560
said, has been an inspiration to me um

1103
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,880
from really my start here at MIT as a

1104
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,119
grad student and is still an inspiration

1105
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,880
today. So with that, I'll thank you and

1106
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,240
I think there'll be some questions. Um

1107
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,240
so, thank you so much.

1108
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,920
SO MUCH JENNIFER FOR THAT visionary

1109
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,240
talk. Um, just some logistics while I

1110
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,400
get us warmed up. We have about 15ish

1111
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,480
minutes for questions. So, if you could

1112
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,480
line up in an orderly fashion and come

1113
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,920
up with a succinct way to ask Jennifer

1114
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,920
your hard-hitting questions, that'd be

1115
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,319
great. So, we can get through as many as

1116
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,720
possible. Um, and maybe while people are

1117
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,359
lining up, I'll get us sort of warmed

1118
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,520
up. Okay. Um, great. From the context of

1119
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,520
tissue engineering. So, you know, I feel

1120
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,280
like many engineer tissue engineers, we

1121
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,640
have like one tissue that we really care

1122
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,560
about and it's as much of a art or a

1123
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,319
craft as it is a science, right? Like I

1124
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,160
know what makes good muscle and I have

1125
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,760
all these things in my head. Yeah.

1126
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,119
>> And one thing I was curious about that

1127
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
you were kind of getting to at the end

1128
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,480
of your talk when you're going from say

1129
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,000
cardiac to kidney to neural tissue.

1130
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,920
Sure, you're changing the cells and

1131
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,280
you're probably changing the bio inks.

1132
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,359
Um, but are you also changing the

1133
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,760
hardware and other things in a really

1134
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,000
specific manner and every time you

1135
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,160
transition to a new tissue, do you have

1136
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,520
to recreate the whole thing? Um, just

1137
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,839
very curious how you think about that

1138
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
process.

1139
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,720
>> I really I really appreciate that

1140
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,960
question. And I want to give a shout out

1141
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,839
to Ritu who's doing some amazing work in

1142
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,200
in this field of biohybrid robotics um

1143
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:42,160
and also in skeletal uh uh tissue and

1144
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,560
and now neuroskeleletal junction. So I

1145
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,599
neuromuscular junctions I I want to say

1146
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,079
that the way I think about you know

1147
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,119
whole organ engineering is it's very

1148
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,319
complex um in the sense of let's take

1149
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,880
your adult heart or your adult kidney in

1150
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,359
the adult human heart. If you look at a

1151
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,200
single cell sequencing and the mapping,

1152
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,680
you know, there's like 17 different cell

1153
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,440
types that one has to put into into a

1154
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,359
tissue to really emulate the the

1155
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,680
organization and and cellular

1156
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,760
composition. And in in the kidney, it's

1157
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,720
about 20 different cell types. We've

1158
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,440
tried to distill this down in our lab to

1159
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,760
sort of key cell types. We realize we're

1160
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,240
going to be missing some of those. But

1161
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,880
we also always have the philosophy of

1162
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,040
let biology do as much of the work as we

1163
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,800
can, which is why we start with, you

1164
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,880
know, human induced purip potent stem

1165
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,960
cells. Not only are they a renewable

1166
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,160
source and they're can be obviously

1167
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,000
patient specific, but we can harness all

1168
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,680
of the exquisite differentiation

1169
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,079
protocols that exist in the literature

1170
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,960
and hopefully also contribute advances

1171
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:53,680
to those that allow biology to do it for

1172
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,880
us. Create the functional architectures

1173
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,200
at the sort of nano micro scale and the

1174
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,520
key cell types of interests. Are they

1175
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,079
perfect? By no means they're they're

1176
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,680
not. And when you work with IND, you

1177
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,359
know, human induced polar potent stem

1178
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,480
cells, you're really following an

1179
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:13,280
embryogenic pathway. So they're not very

1180
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,400
mature as cells. So this idea of being

1181
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,800
able to perfuse them and mature them

1182
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,640
both in vitro and ultimately in vivo is

1183
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,640
essential. But your question was also

1184
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:27,119
about the hardware. And I would say

1185
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:30,559
that, you know, we we certainly have um

1186
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,559
some ongoing work now to uh bring in

1187
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,800
some of the more sophisticated nozzle

1188
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,200
designs and things to our our

1189
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,000
bioprinting side of things. But I would

1190
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:43,119
say ultimately at least in in the short

1191
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,280
run, um we haven't really made as many

1192
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,559
as much progress there as as we could

1193
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,760
have. Um but certainly that's where we

1194
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:54,880
need to go because for example we really

1195
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,480
need to capture these these cells where

1196
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,400
we need them in the architectures that

1197
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,319
we want. But we try to do that as much

1198
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,359
as we can with biology because if you're

1199
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,119
going to print a complex tissue with you

1200
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,640
know multiple cell types and you don't

1201
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,319
have single cell resolution and you you

1202
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,839
would it would require months to build

1203
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,359
this tissue and you have basically an

1204
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,680
hour cells are going to die if they

1205
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,280
don't get perused and get nutrients. So,

1206
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,640
I don't think it's going to be a pure

1207
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,800
hardware play

1208
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,880
>> is is is I guess the simple answer to

1209
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,599
that. So, long- winded, but that's the

1210
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,800
end uh the answer that I would give.

1211
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,200
>> That makes a lot of sense.

1212
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,720
>> Yeah.

1213
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,680
>> Um do you want to get us started on

1214
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,520
questions?

1215
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,520
>> Um thank you so much for the wonderful

1216
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,040
talk. I'm very inspiring and really

1217
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,680
passionate about what you do.

1218
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,760
>> Um I just wanted to ask like a simple

1219
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,880
question. So when do you think we'll be

1220
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,119
able to like bioprint

1221
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,839
skin into like a scar or something like

1222
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,440
that?

1223
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,960
>> Yeah, that's a great question. I mean

1224
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,280
there's certainly some pioneering work

1225
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,079
that has been done here on the on

1226
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,520
ascellular uh skin repair and

1227
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,079
regeneration. Um you know and there's

1228
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,040
also some some work going on now in in

1229
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,599
making skin based organoids and the

1230
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,640
thing that those organoids have that say

1231
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,599
just printing cell monollayers epidermal

1232
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,040
dermal layers um which we can do now

1233
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,200
we're doing in our lab actually and

1234
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,720
we've actually published in this space

1235
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,160
is you don't have hair follicles and

1236
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,000
that's actually kind of an important

1237
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,960
embodiment right so if you start with

1238
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,319
like you know these skin organoids they

1239
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,559
actually develop their own hair

1240
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,559
follicles. So I think that field is kind

1241
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,280
of wide open right now. It's very nent

1242
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,079
in some ways even though there are you

1243
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,520
know commercial asellular scaffolds that

1244
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,200
can do wound healing and things like

1245
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,079
that for burn victims. But I think

1246
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,880
there's it's like wide open space.

1247
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,440
>> Thank you so much.

1248
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,359
>> Yep. Thanks for your question.

1249
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,559
>> Yeah, I obviously want to add that it

1250
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,000
was a really inspiring lecture and this

1251
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,400
is actually the second time I heard you

1252
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,160
speak. I think you were here in 2023. uh

1253
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,319
I don't remember if it was the same

1254
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,119
lecture series but it's incredible to

1255
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,440
see how things have advanced since. Uh

1256
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,359
my question I'm a a space systems

1257
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,920
researcher so I know absolutely nothing

1258
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,760
about this domain but as I'm sure you're

1259
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,319
familiar with this is quite a there's

1260
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,559
quite a lot of hype around 3D biorinting

1261
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:15,119
or bio printing in space obviously

1262
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,720
organoids as well but that's sort of

1263
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,119
that tends to be the moonshot that

1264
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,040
people bring up when they um you know

1265
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,880
try to get investment for example for

1266
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,720
space-based um applications and

1267
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,760
architectural development. You talk a

1268
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,760
lot about sacrificial ink development.

1269
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,480
So it is clear that that is something

1270
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,240
that if not it's not necessarily the

1271
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,720
main blockage or the choke point or a

1272
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,640
challenge but it it does impact designs.

1273
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,800
I'm wondering how you see the potential

1274
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,119
effect of microgravity and whether that

1275
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,599
could actually mean a substantial

1276
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,599
difference to to justify doing any of

1277
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,559
what you do or any sort of bio printing

1278
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,720
in space.

1279
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,960
>> Yeah, that's a great question. I mean as

1280
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,440
we as we build now if we're doing

1281
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,559
embedded printing the support bath can

1282
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,480
basically provide support for the object

1283
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,440
being built right but if you're doing

1284
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,680
direct biorinting at some point as you

1285
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,240
get above a certain number of layers

1286
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,559
that self-weight becomes very important

1287
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,559
and it causes deformation in the layers

1288
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,920
underneath and so one of the things

1289
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,480
that's you know helpful about

1290
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,200
microgravity is that self-weight can be

1291
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,040
much larger because you're in a micro G

1292
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,319
environment instead of a 1G environment,

1293
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,640
right? So you can I think create larger

1294
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,559
constructs in a micro gravity

1295
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,480
environment. Convection of course is

1296
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,240
also dominant. So how does that affect

1297
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,000
nutrient delivery and these kinds of

1298
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,000
things? You know, we haven't done

1299
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,160
printing in space so I can't say from

1300
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,880
you know firsthand but I think it would

1301
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,160
be an interesting avenue to pursue.

1302
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,640
>> Thank you.

1303
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,319
>> Great. Um and we have some online

1304
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,000
questions as well. So, I thought maybe

1305
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,920
we could wrap up with one of those and

1306
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,119
particularly there's one that's um a

1307
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,800
little open-ended. So, I thought we

1308
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,440
could end with some philosophy.

1309
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,319
>> Um so, this person wants to know how the

1310
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,559
sort of creative ideas for new materials

1311
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,960
or hardware emerge in your lab. Is it

1312
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,680
like you see something odd in an

1313
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,200
experiment and then something happens or

1314
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,800
is there a big picture application

1315
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,359
you're working towards and then you work

1316
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,119
backwards?

1317
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:15,440
>> I think it's a combination. It really

1318
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:17,839
depends on the um target

1319
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,880
We as I try to highlight I may maybe

1320
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:22,880
didn't do a full job a fully complete

1321
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,480
job. We've benefited a lot from

1322
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,559
collaborating collaborations and

1323
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,880
sometimes those collaborations like we

1324
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,160
want a self-healing material that that

1325
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,880
has a biomimetic vascule that drives the

1326
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,640
advances and sometimes it is like an

1327
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,400
insight where you have this light bulb

1328
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,720
moment and you're just like wow if we

1329
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,559
could do it here we can we can go after

1330
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,240
you know humans tissues what is that

1331
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,319
going to entail let's get to you know

1332
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,960
let's get to Boston to the mecca of

1333
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,400
biotech and find out right so I think

1334
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,000
you know it's a combin it's a

1335
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,559
combination And sometimes it's

1336
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,839
serendipity like I have to say the

1337
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:00,000
genesis for embedded printing came much

1338
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:02,480
much earlier than the first paper. I was

1339
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,440
in the lab. My student Jim Smeay who was

1340
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,280
really pioneering this technique brought

1341
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,079
the print head that he was printing this

1342
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,640
aquous you know colloidal gel and he put

1343
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,720
it into a vial of liquid and all of a

1344
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,960
sudden because there was still some over

1345
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,800
pressure the filament came out and I was

1346
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,960
like oh interesting. We can print under

1347
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:25,119
liquids. we can you know and that sort

1348
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,359
of ended up uh to our first you know um

1349
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,280
uh polyelerolyte printing paper where we

1350
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,599
were using that then this fluid

1351
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,280
reservoir to drive coagulation of these

1352
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,280
oppositely char so sometimes it's

1353
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,000
serendipity sometimes it's being driven

1354
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,839
by an application a goal it's a

1355
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,319
combination but thank you

1356
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:44,000
>> that's very helpful great um so I'm sure

1357
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,640
there's more questions but there is also

1358
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,559
a reception um so maybe let's wrap up by

1359
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,880
thanking Jennifer for her time and her

1360
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,880
visionary

1361
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,640
I'll take your question.

1362
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,960
>> Yeah.

1363
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,720
>> So, uh Jennifer, uh we do want to make

1364
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,680
sure that we leave you with a small

1365
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,440
momentto. Uh you have indeed inspired

1366
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,640
many many of us.

1367
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,760
>> We have a little pumpkin made by MI.

1368
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,319
Yes.

1369
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
>> Awesome.

1370
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,559
>> Thank you so much for being here with us

1371
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,839
today.

1372
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,400
>> We look forward to the next time we get

1373
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,599
you here.

1374
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,160
>> Okay. Thank you.

1375
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,200
>> Thank you.

1376
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,559
>> Thank you.

1377
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,559
Thank you so much. Thank you all for

1378
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,559
coming.
