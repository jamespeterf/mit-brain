O'Neal transportation is responsible for

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,320
nearly a quarter of all energy related

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,519
carbon dioxide CO2 emissions worldwide

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,240
making decarbonizing the sector critical

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
to reducing carbon emissions and

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,640
addressing climate

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,399

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,920
introduce students to the factors

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,120
involved in addressing this complex

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,760
challenge we want people to be grounded

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,760
in reality so they can make good

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,800
decisions about what it takes to get to

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,760
zero carbon emissions says Andrew

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,359
salsberg a lecturer in mit's Department

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,399
of urban studies and planning the former

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,160
head of Transportation policy at Uber

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,640
salsberg taught the class together with

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,359
Jin waza the Edward and Joy Lind

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,559
associate professor of city and

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,960
Transportation Planning and director of

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,479
the MIT Mobility initiative this course

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,320
the first of its kind at MIT Works to

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,799
place transportation in the context of

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,799
broader decarbonization efforts while

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,759
also situating the decarbonization

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,119
challenge in the specific landscape of

33
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,920
Transportation Planning Z says

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,439
transportation is now the leading source

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,280
of carbon pollution in the United States

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
this is a unique moment that calls for a

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
course specifically and narrowly focused

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,799
on decarbonization in urban Mobility

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,680
Urban Mobility is an important Focus

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,680
because cities are the epicenter of the

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,159
technology Revolution taking place in

42
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,119
Mobility with new options such as ride

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,479
sharing autonomous vehicles and

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,399
passenger drones nevertheless

45
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,600
Transportation has proved stubbornly

46
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,600
difficult to decarbonize making this

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,200
sector ripe for further studies Z says

48
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,039
Transportation presents a special

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,439
challenge because it involves just about

50
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,560
everyone salsburg says we're talking

51
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,920
about hundreds of millions of Vehicles

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,039
almost all burning fossil fuels so there

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,840
are a great many decision makers who are

54
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,039
choosing how they want to get around he

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,480
says you have to win a lot of hearts and

56
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,120
Minds so that makes it hard the

57
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,200
complexity of the topic came as a

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,879
surprise to paja biy 24 a computer

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,840
science and engineering major who took

60
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,160
the inaugural class in Fall 2021 I

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,599
thought if everyone just adopted

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,200
electric vehicles and took public

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,239
transportation we'd be good she says

64
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,319
instead biology learned that many

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,519
factors contribute to the problem

66
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,959
including how far people need to travel

67
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,680
the fuel efficiency of vehicles and the

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,239
amount of carbon emitted to power

69
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,120
vehicles even electric cars which can

70
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,599
draw power from either renewable or

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,280
fossil fueled sources there are also

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,800
Myriad possible solutions including not

73
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,879
only the adoption of more energy

74
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,519
efficient modes of transportation but

75
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,480
also policy approaches such as

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,080
establishing low emission zones or

77
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,640
imposing carbon taxes when you talk

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,200
about decarbonizing Transportation two

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,879
main themes are to approach with

80
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,159
technology electric cars clean energy

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,159
Etc or through the policy side we try to

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,519
emphasize to students that just one or

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,280
the other was not going to be a

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,239
sufficient approach given the scale of

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,000
the problem says Nicholas caros a PhD

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
student in civil and environmental

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,480
engineering who served as a teaching

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,080
assistant for the class hopefully this

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,120
expanded their thinking decarbonizing

90
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,000
transportation is a Hot Topic so there's

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,400
a lot of information out there but it's

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,040
hard to understand what you should

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,720
prioritize says Mara kedi Sanchez a PhD

94
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,560
student in the media lab who took the

95
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,319
class which was open to both

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,920
undergraduate and graduate students they

97
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,599
don't give you the answers of course but

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,080
it's a very good class in the sense that

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,080
you start to understand that these are

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,319
the tools that we have these are the

101
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,079
potential impacts and these are the

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,239
challenges quantitative

103
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:56,000
approach to help students assess

104
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,159
decarbonizing options The Faculty began

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,799
by introducing a mathematical construct

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,840
known as the Kaya identity which uses

107
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
factors such as population gross

108
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,480
domestic product and energy consumption

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,560
data to quantify how much human sources

110
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,280
contribute to carbon emissions it's MIT

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,239
so it helps to be quantitative when we

112
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,239
can salsberg says carus explains that

113
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,919
Transportation emissions are also broken

114
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,400
down into contributing factors with each

115
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,000
providing a lever for control the

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,840
components of a commute by car for

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
example would include how energy

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,400
efficient the vehicle is but also the

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,800
distance traveled so while technology

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
can make the vehicle more energy

121
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,199
efficient working from home could reduce

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,680
emissions even further which was a key

123
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,240
takeaway for kti one of the biggest

124
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,000
lessons from the class is the importance

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,560
of reducing the vehicle miles traveled

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,320
she says similarly while public

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,120
transportation can often be a better

128
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
choice in terms of emissions that's not

129
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,680
invariably the case if you're the only

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,440
person on the bus taking it might be a

131
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,560
worse decision than driving by yourself

132
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,280
Cara says to illustrate such trade-offs

133
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,400
in one assignment the instructors gave

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,240
students a simple spreadsheet tool and

135
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,039
asked them to design their own Pathways

136
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,600
to reducing Boston's carbon emissions it

137
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,560
was a sobering exercise salsburg says

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,560
because even in a city like Boston with

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,720
fairly robust public transportation

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,199
options it's hard to find alternatives

141
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,520
to driving for long distances students

142
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
were also assigned to debate

143
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,800
decarbonization solutions they could

144
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,880
choose either to reduce vehicle miles

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,919
traveled or to Electrify everything but

146
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,680
after choosing their topics salsburg had

147
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,440
the students argue the opposing point of

148
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,160
that was a very good experience K says I

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,319
was going to argue for reducing vehicle

150
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,960
miles traveled then I switched to

151
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,600
electrification and learn that there are

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,360
also very valid Arguments for that

153
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,000
option learning from

154
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,680
experts over the course of the semester

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,440
students heard from more than a dozen

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,520
guest speakers on topics ranging from

157
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,080
city planning to the power generation

158
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,680
needs of electric vehicles we've never

159
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,759
decarbonized Transportation so you can't

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,039
look back to get those lessons we're

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,600
trying to learn from people who are

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,560
doing it as we speak ssbg says Reed ying

163
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,960
a professor of city and Metropolitan

164
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,840
planning at the University of Utah

165
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,000
explained that City design directly

166
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,199
impacts Transportation emissions since

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,800
people in dense cities such as New York

168
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,880
or Boston don't have to travel as far

169
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,599
for everyday activities as do residents

170
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,960
of sprawling cities such as Houston

171
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,400
Nathaniel whoredom a managing consultant

172
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,680
at the nonprofit Center for

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,000
transportation and the environment

174
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,919
illuminated the challenge es of

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,080
switching to battery powered electric

176
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,479
buses they don't work very well in the

177
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,280
cold the batteries don't perform as well

178
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,240
and you have to heat the bus caros says

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,759
bologi says she most enjoyed the talk by

180
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,639
Greg Rogers from nuro a robotics company

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,039
that makes autonomous zero emission

182
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,880
delivery vehicles it was interesting to

183
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,360
hear his perspective on how that kind of

184
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,840
Transportation will impact climate

185
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,639
change she

186
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,960
says a variety of

187
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,960
solutions for the final assignment

188
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,840
salsberg and Z asked students to lay out

189
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,440
a strategy for reducing emissions in a

190
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,160
city of their choice proposed Solutions

197
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,919
bicycles for her PhD research examined

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,160
the impact on emissions of enabling

199
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,080
shared bicycles to relocate themselves

200
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,840
to spots where they are most needed

201
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,440
currently trucks are often used for this

says the range of projects from parking

204
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,759
standards to bike lane design felt like

205
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,000
a real endorsement of the whole idea of

206
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,720
the course which is that there's a wide

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,360
range of solutions that we should be

208
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,039
talking about together for kti the

209
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,479
assignment underscored her main takeaway

210
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,960
from the class you have to do a lot of

211
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,080
everything to meet the climate Target
