1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,600
so my name is yonas I'm an associate

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,960
professor in the operations Management

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,880
Group I've taught uh

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,000
om uh introduction to operations

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,040
management for the in the MBA program as

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,960
well as a healthcare elective uh across

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,439
programs and my research is part or like

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,640
a big chunk of my research is in global

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,279
health so I'll talk a little bit about

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,960
that and why I think it's um an

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
interesting kind of field to be in and

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,480
then I'll give an example of something

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,040
we did and I should say just like Karen

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,680
I've had a bunch of NBA and Ras in the

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,200
past and they without exception been

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,120
fantastic I've had a really really

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,719
really good experience working with MBA

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,960
and students on all of the things that

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,360
Karen said and theyve often been very

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,079
kind of heavily involved in the sort of

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,879
scope being an an early stage idea

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,120
generation which has been fantastic so

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,000
uh I work in healthcare like I said uh

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,320
and I think uh I've done work on sort of

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,640
global Health uh on ambulance systems on

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,840
public health and so I think what makes

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,119
my profile a little bit different from

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,439
other people who work in health is that

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,759
I haven't been doing any Hospital

30
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,040
operations so I've been interested in

31
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,200
these sort of higher level systems that

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,560
contribute to health outside of the uh

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,000
outside of the buildings of Hospitals

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
and Clinics and so on um and I think

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,439
another thing that's maybe a little bit

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,720
unique is all of this effort on global

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,479
health so Global Health meaning um sort

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,320
of not the medicine not the technology

39
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,920
but like the operational and system

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,840
design of the systems we use to deliver

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
Health in very very resource limited

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,119
settings so these are settings that are

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,479
so resource constraints for example you

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,520
know in sub Africa like Ken mentioned uh

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,799
that their systems just look

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,479
fundamentally different from what we

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,079
used to uh at least in the US and in the

48
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,960
UK where I was before uh and so they

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,840
require kind of a different way of

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,560
thinking different typ set of tools uh

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,039
and so they make for very interesting

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,719
problems so let me talk a little bit

53
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,600
about why I like this as an area and

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,800
then give an example I think I can be

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,200
pretty quick but we'll see so uh I like

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
working on this because I think there's

57
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,840
potential for impact just like Karen

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
said like we I think we're all

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,319
interested in in having some impact on

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,280
the ground and you know if you just look

61
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,800
at basic basic statistics uh there's a

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,239
lot of work to be done for example in

63
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Subs Africa like we're talking about

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,640
high prevalence of preventable death

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,920
which is by definition preventable

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,920
because we know how to deal with it

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,599
clinically and technologically we just

68
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,040
haven't put the proper systems in

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,239
place uh the next reason is or you know

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
for that reason because it's a systems

71
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,640
problem there's like an operational

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,080
botton neck operations research

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,280
operations management analytics are the

74
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,480
right tools to deal with it right so

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,959
it's not about fundamental biology or

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,400
medicine it's really about systems uh

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
and so I think the

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,680
expertise uh that we have in operations

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,040
and analytics is is actually the right

80
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,640
tool kit to now make a difference um

81
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,599
like I said before these systems are

82
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,920
very different from what we've been

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,120
doing like our field has been doing

84
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,440
Hospital operations for probably 20 25

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
years but it's not as if the insights

86
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,879
from those types of analysis would

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
transfer directly to Subs Africa just

88
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,720
because the infrastructure the systems

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,799
the challenges everything is different

90
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,720
even the kind of priorities in terms of

91
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,760
which clinical conditions we look at is

92
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,799
is different and so we need to do uh

93
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,959
kind of fundamental systems research to

94
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,599
be able to address big questions in this

95
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,760
in this field and finally uh and this is

96
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,640
relevant for an analytics crowd another

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,040
thing that's happened is with you know

98
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,159
the Clinton Foundation The Gates

99
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,760
Foundation and these types of

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,400
Institutions becoming involved with

101
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,560
global Health delivery on the ground is

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,519
that now we have access to data that

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,599
before we did not have right so it was

104
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,000
very different I was too young at the

105
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,000
time but I think it was very different

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,640
30 years ago trying to make an impact on

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,799
the field in global health because you

108
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,040
didn't have sort of routine operational

109
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,720
data being collected now we do have some

110
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,079
of that and so we can actually use

111
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,799
analytics um to try to make a difference

112
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,320
okay um this is really the key thing so

113
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,680
if people have questions about this I'd

114
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,160
love to talk about this but I'll also

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,199
give an example of a project that I

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,880
think kind of fits at this to some

117
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,240
extent all of these

118
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,639
so uh the background is is H HIV H right

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,000
uh as you probably know the prevalence

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
of AGS is predominantly focused on Subs

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,039
Africa so it's a big big challenge uh

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,440
and the global Community has made a ton

123
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,320
of uh progress in terms of diagnosing

124
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,960
AIDS right so we get people diagnosed

125
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,240
and get them on treatment the

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,000
interesting thing is then the focus of

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,840
uh of Public Health shifts kind of I

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,639
guess up or Downstream and the Cascade

129
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,000
in the sense that it's not enough to get

130
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,840
people on treatment you need to make

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,560
sure the treatment is working and that

132
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,199
adhering adhering to it right and so the

133
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,240
goals now are these 9090 90 90% of

134
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
people being aware of the status 90% of

135
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,479
those being on treatment and then 90% of

136
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,160
those having suppressed viral load and

137
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,479
we're nowhere near these targets

138
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,199
okay and what you need to make sure that

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,800
the person who's on anti-retroviral

140
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:28,280
therapy for HIV is uh the that the virus

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,479
is suppressed is uh PCR testing and a

142
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,160
few years ago no nobody about PCR but

143
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,800
now everyone does and so these this

144
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,199
require sort of heavy duty lab equipment

145
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,400
okay uh and in for example Mala the the

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,600
country we were working with you have

147
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,960
you know hundreds and hundreds of

148
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,560
clinics out in the communities some of

149
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,440
them very rural uh but only about 10

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,160
molecular Labs that have the capacity to

151
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,400
do this testing okay uh and so what you

152
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,800
need to do is to collect samples blood

153
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,240
samples from people out in the field

154
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,520
transport them to a district up and then

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
to a lab and then the results back to

156
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,479
the field so that they can be

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,720
communicated with the patients so this

158
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,000
an example where uh clearly the

159
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,039
operational system that's in place has a

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,360
lot to do with how effectively we can

161
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,720
you know try to achieve these uh goals

162
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,080
that I said

163
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,520
before uh we work with uh an NGO called

164
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,319
writers for health which is sort of

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,400
operates these motorcycle couriers who

166
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,120
do this Transportation they go collect

167
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,599
some bring them to the district and then

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,199
to the lab then pick up results and

169
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,680
bring them back to the

170
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,000
clinic and when we started engaging with

171
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,800
them we realized that basically what

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,720
they were doing is they were doing sort

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,520
of these fixed Postman RS so the

174
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,520
couriers would do the same schedule

175
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,960
every week okay this was just a way to

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
kind of guarantee a certain service

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,599
level when they negotiated with the

178
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,919
Ministry of Health to set this up the

179
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,599
issue with this is that there was a very

180
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,599
very high proportion of empty trips like

181
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,000
there would be visiting places driving

182
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,960
for hours and not having any samples to

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,800
pick up or any results to return and on

184
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
top of that you know because they were

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
doing this sort of inefficient

186
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,800
scheduling they were contributing to

187
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,960
delays uh and so which is bad for

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
patient

189
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,599
obviously and so we kind of thought of

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,160
this somewhat simple system but it

191
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:26,560
doesn't have uh uh any precedence in

192
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,599
sort of global Health which was a let's

193
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,599
design some sort of communication system

194
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,319
that allows people in the field to

195
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,599
communicate to us the NGO whether or not

196
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,960
there are samples to be picked up and

197
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,520
it's not obvious how to do this right um

198
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,120
because there's no it might not be

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,039
electricity there's no managerial uh

200
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,680
infrastructure and so on okay and we

201
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,159
didn't want to deploy new technology

202
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,520
because then we have to maintain it and

203
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:55,919
we didn't want to uh put valuable sort

204
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,080
of new technology in the field in case

205
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,680
uh it doesn't stay there very long so we

206
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,159
had to convince health workers to use

207
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,919
their own technology their own phones to

208
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,360
communicate with us okay the second part

209
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,319
was even if you have all this

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,879
information it's not obvious what to do

211
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,000
right on Nationwide even if you know

212
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
where there are samples it's not an easy

213
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
thing to do to route and schedule

214
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,440
Courier trips to make sure that you're

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,680
you have the most kind of efficient

216
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,000
system possible and so that's where

217
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,039
optimization came in and so the idea was

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,680
we'll sort of crowdsource the data from

219
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,080
the health workers they'll use their own

220
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,000
phones to tell us whether or not there

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,200
are samples to get picked up and then

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,440
we'll use optimization to schedule and

223
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,159
Route couriers on a day-to-day basic

224
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,839
basis so it will be much much more

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,120
Dynamic than the old kind of Postman

226
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,720
system that was in place

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,880
before three minutes okay so let me just

228
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,440
do this very very quickly so the the

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,399
system for crowdsourcing the data was uh

230
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,720
was this sort of ussd system that was

231
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,959
free of chars to all of the health

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,839
workers in the country and we only ask

233
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,720
them at the end of the day enter the

234
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,959
system use the code that corresponds to

235
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,600
your facility and tell us how many

236
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,120
samples are waiting okay so ideally very

237
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,200
little disruption to the day all they

238
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,519
needed was to have their phone charged

239
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,240
and we' already checked that most of

240
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,839
them have

241
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,120
phones

242
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,240
uh so that was sort of the main part of

243
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,160
the information system I'll skip very

244
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,240
quickly through the the transportation

245
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,399
optimization it's basically about using

246
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,440
this information and then

247
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,120
predicting uh the samples that will be

248
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,920
coming in in the next week and based on

249
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,399
this information try to come up with a

250
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,160
smart schedule and routes uh for the

251
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,959
couriers to to pick up samples and

252
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,200
deliver

253
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,240
results uh and then the interesting

254
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,640
thing was what we were able to implement

255
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,079
this so we implemented in these three

256
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,279
districts uh that were meant to be kind

257
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:50,800
of representative of the scope and scale

258
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,040
of the different or the characteristics

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,880
of the different uh districts in the

260
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,200
country uh I'll just I'll go very

261
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,440
quickly through the results but what I'm

262
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,120
proudest of is we did this in three

263
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,640
districts then completely handed off to

264
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,160
the field so the NGO in country now owns

265
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,200
the system and since then this has been

266
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,360
scaled up and it's now running in 11

267
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,320
districts and the Ministry of Health and

268
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,440
the CTC in the US who's the main funer

269
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,440
of this uh have committed funds and have

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,959
like a timeline for scaling this up

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,079
nationally so the hope is that you know

272
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,360
in a couple of years the system we

273
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,399
designed kind of doing desk research

274
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,079
that MIT will be used to Route uh and

275
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,120
sort crowdsource data all through the

276
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:35,040
country to try to make HIV diagnosis and

277
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,800
viral Lo monitoring uh more

278
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,000
efficient I'll do maybe one set of

279
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,240
results um so the first thing is we

280
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,560
actually got data from health workers

281
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,360
the second thing is the data was

282
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,440
reasonably accurate so this was an

283
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,680
empirical question we didn't know if

284
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,600
this was going to happen uh using this

285
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,800
data we were able to shorten the delays

286
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,880
associated with transportation and we

287
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,560
were basically able to eliminate these

288
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,839
empty trips this is obviously useful for

289
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,639
operations but it turned out to be

290
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,959
really really really valuable for the

291
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,959
NGO in country as well because they were

292
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,120
getting they were losing credibility

293
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,680
because people saw them as wasteful

294
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,519
because they had these empty trifts and

295
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,079
then using you know this it system and

296
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,160
an analytics we were able to kind of uh

297
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,040
help their status in country as well to

298
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,040
to sort of come across as a professional

299
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,040
partner to the Ministry of Health
