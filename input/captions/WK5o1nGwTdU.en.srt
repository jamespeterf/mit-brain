My name is Luis Perez Breva and I teach

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,640
the MIT class on how to move

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,720
technologies from lab to impact. It is

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,320
called innovation teams and it's the

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,800
longest running course at MIT in

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,880
technology innovation. In it, students

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
learn to solve problems with technology.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,880
This series of videos is an introduction

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
to a whole new mindset for innovation.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,000
We can help you think the way the most

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,920
creative engineers do. There's 40 years

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,680
worth of technology sitting and awaiting

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,239
for individuals with a new kind of

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,079
problem solving skill. I will share with

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
you the MIT way to solve problems with

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
technology. Many of the ideas I will

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,800
share with you in these videos and more

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,800
can be found in my book, Innovating AR's

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Manifesto.
