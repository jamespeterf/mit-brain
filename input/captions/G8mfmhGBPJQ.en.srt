1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,680
And last but not least, please welcome

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,200
QET. Developing scalable hardware

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
solutions for quantum device

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,599
connectivity that seamlessly integrate

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,040
with existing infrastructure to enable

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,040
deployable quantum networks.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
Thank you. All right. Thank you very

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
much. Excited to be here and talk to you

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
more about what we're building. My name

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
is Laura Andre and I'm the president and

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
CEO of QNET where we're building quantum

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,920
networking hardware powering the next

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,320
generation of global connectivity.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
So a little bit about the company. Uh we

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
spun out of the work of professors Durk

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,760
England at MIT and SYOT Gua at the

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,760
University of Maryland in 2022. And in

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,399
just three years we've secured five US

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,320
government contracts and are backed by

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
leading accelerator programs and state

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,039
innovation funding. We've also developed

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,719
an early product sales pipeline and are

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
seeing active interest from commercial

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,239
partners. Our mission is simple but bold

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,239
and that is to build the hardware

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,720
foundation for scalable platform

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,799
agnostic quantum networking all the way

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,479
from local links to global connectivity.

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
So there are four major trends driving

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,280
the future of connectivity. We have AI

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
and hypers scale data centers reaching

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
the limits of encryptionbased security.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,000
the geopolitical race for securing

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
critical infrastructure and also the

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,880
rise of quantum computers. These four

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,439
forces point to um an underlying issue.

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,600
The network stack that our digital world

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,079
relies on is only as strong as its

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,079
foundation and the network security

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,159
depends on the physical layer and today

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,479
it's vulnerable. So we're building the

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
foundation that secures the full stack

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960
and powers the next generation of global

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,600
connectivity

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,320
and quantum entanglement is the ultimate

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,200
solution beyond today's math-based

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,159
encryption standards. Uh first it's uh

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,360
tamper evident guaranteed by physics. So

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,000
any uh detection of um interception

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,920
attempts is immediately detectable. It's

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
also provably secure because it's not

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
reliant on math problems or computing

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
assumptions. It's also resilient by

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
design withstanding advances in

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,760
algorithms and quantum computers.

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,680
So by securing uh channels um we can

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
secure channels end to end uh by

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
distributing entanglement across the

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
network.

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
However, the problem is that today's

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
networks are not compatible with quantum

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
information. There are two main

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,160
barriers. Uh the first challenge is that

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,560
sign signals suffer losses that grow

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,959
exponentially with distance and we can't

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,800
just amplify or regenerate uh quantum

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,920
signals like we do with uh classical

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,840
signals. Uh so what we need are um high

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,560
rate uh entangled photon sources that

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
overcome these losses at scale. The

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,160
second challenge is that conventional

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,000
hardware like routers and switches

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,640
destroy the quantum properties of the

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,319
signals. Uh so we need to build uh

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,080
quantum routers and quantum repeaters

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,680
that are capable of preserving the

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
fragile quantum states we want to

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,760
transmit.

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,000
And so quantum information demands a new

80
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,000
hardware stack and uh we are building

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,640
it. So uh we're delivering provably

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,239
secure communications today while also

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,640
uh laying the foundation for the quantum

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,200
internet of tomorrow.

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,200
and those two barriers that I mentioned

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,800
um we've uh solved these two major

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,959
challenges uh through uh two um systems

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,519
that we are focused on building. So the

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,840
first is entangled photon pair sources

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,640
which deliver entangled pairs of photons

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,120
at high rate on demand uh in the telecom

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,640
band that are uh ready to be integrated

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,760
with current infrastructure and are

94
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,680
capable of overcoming loss at scale.

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,599
Second are our mega cubit quantum

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,400
routers with integrated quantum memories

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,040
that enable buffering, synchronization

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
and switching for quantum signals. And

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
our uh integrated quantum memory skills

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,439
directly to uh millions of cubits, the

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
levels we know we need for commercially

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,840
relevant applications.

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,799
So our near-term target is

104
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,120
unconditionally secure communications

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
where we're securing existing uh

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,439
classical channels for sensitive data

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,519
transmission. But the same uh hardware

108
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,000
foundation that we're building is also

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
capable of the next generation of

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
applications where we're allowing

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,759
quantum devices to coherently share

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,479
quantum information. So extending this

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,280
to quantum security and precision um

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,360
precision of pnt and sensor networks all

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,360
the way to network distributed quantum

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,360
computing.

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,960
Uh we also have some upcoming pilot

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,440
deployments planned for our hardware

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,199
along with uh partners uh in Boston and

120
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,680
Maryland. Uh we're getting ready to

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,680
deploy our hardware stack on uh quantum

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
network test beds uh which will prove

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,320
out our hardware working not just in the

124
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,560
lab but in real world networks.

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,560
Uh so if you're interested in exploring

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,800
uh quantum networking uh we'd love to

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,993
talk to you um in our uh break coming up

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,440
next. Thank you very much.

129
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:03,919
>> [applause]

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,120
>> Thank you so much, Laura. Questions from

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,120
the audience? Anyone?

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,400
I have a question. Where do you see the

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,600
first real world impact of quantum

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,759
networking? uh and how close we are we

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,000
>> yeah so um with the um sort of

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,400
applications roadmap I showed uh we

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,800
really see the near-term impacts in uh

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
securing classical channels and then as

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,479
uh professor Freriedman also talked

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,240
about those more quantum internet type

141
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,000
applications where we're really

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,440
eliminating those interfaces between

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,680
classical and quantum and allowing

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,440
quantum devices to coherently share

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,759
quantum information

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,600
>> thank you and one more question what

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,759
parallels exist between the early days

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,320
of classical internet and where are we

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,520
today with quantum internet?

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,360
>> Yeah. So, um you know as uh computers

151
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,199
were first being developed they weren't

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
uh beingworked and uh people didn't

153
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,639
really you know know what you know that

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
would be useful for. I think you know

155
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,759
quantum networking is still sort of

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,320
searching for that killer application.

157
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
Uh but we'll find it and we'll be um

158
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,280
building the hardware that will allow us

159
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,919
to get there.

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,400
>> Excellent. Thank you. Anyone else have

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,560
question?

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
Oh, sorry. here. I think I saw somebody

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
in there.

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
>> Thank you.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,479
>> Get your steps in.

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,479
>> Um, is there currently a pointto-point

167
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,240
uh demo of [snorts] uh a data link that

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,400
you have running?

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
>> Um, not that we have running yet, but

170
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,400
we're hoping to get that up and running

171
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,880
uh in the next year or so on the Boston

172
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
test bed. Uh, some uh partners at MIT

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,919
and Harvard have already demonstrated

174
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,919
that with some really nice work. So,

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
>> it took quantum to get MIT and Harvard

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,209
talking to each other. Is that what

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
you're saying?

178
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,720
>> [laughter]

179
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,880
>> Not necessarily, but it helped.

180
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,880
>> Thank you.

181
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,019
>> All right. Thank you so much, Laura.

182
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,019
[applause]
