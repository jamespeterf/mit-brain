1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,560
and thank you for giving me the

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,240
opportunity to speak today and show you

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,000
some of the work we have conducted in

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,519
the laboratory of Professor Roger k um

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,679
today I will talk about the humanizing

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,639
drug development brain Consortium and

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,920
the work that we have done into building

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,480
NE neurovascular models of neurological

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
diseases so it is well known that

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
neurodegenerative diseases affect

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
millions of people worldwide and pose a

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,400
significant concern in the elderly

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,400
population and despite the needs for

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,759
therapies we still lack effective

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,640
Therapeutics and this can be attributed

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,680
to the ineptness of animal models into

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,160
reproducing the pathophysiology of the

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,600
humans and which lead to high failure

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,520
rates of the clinical trials and in the

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,440
latest year um the initro research has

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,239
developed lot and in particular

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,160
microphysiological systems of MPS which

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,160
are complex multicellular system have

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,079
demonstrated superiority over

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,519
conventional inital cell culture um

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,160
because they can better recapit toate

27
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,600
complex cellular niches including the

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,720
neurovascular

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,520
unit in the last few years we have

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,799
collaborated with many pharmaceutical

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,000
companies and forming the humanizing

32
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,560
drug development brain Consortium which

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,720
main focus is the development of MPS

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,360
able to closely mimic neurological

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,320
diseases in vro in order to do so we

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,240
co-culture the blood brain barrier or

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,400
BBB with neuronal tisue which is able to

38
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,439
recapitulate Alzheimer's and Parkinson

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,040
disease phenotypes um the main um role

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,079
of the bloodb brain barrier in our body

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
is to work as a selective filter in

42
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,439
order to prevent armful substances into

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,439
enter of our brain is composed by three

44
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,399
uh cells types which are the endothelia

45
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,200
cells which are represented in the imun

46
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,079
staining of the BBB on the left in white

47
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,920
by parasites in red and the asoc sites

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,320
in green another big goal of the

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Consortium is to shift from the use of

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,479
primary cells line into using ipss dve

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,560
because then they can better

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,280
recapitulate the neurovascular model and

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,759
with this we can investigate different

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,200
transport routs into the brain for drug

55
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,599
delivery and screening purposes so the

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,239
final main goal is then to develop of

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
invitro model which can be an

58
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,040
alternative to animal based

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,200
model the microfluidic neurovascular

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,000
co-culture platform that we are using in

61
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,440
our lab is the one represented by the

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,519
schematic on the left so there is a BBB

63
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Central chamber where we can uh insert

64
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,160
the culture of the tree cells composed

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,200
in the BBB B the endoa says the Ayes and

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,440
the parasites in a mixture of fibrine

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,319
gel there is a central

68
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,920
compartment

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,040
uh okay no um which is used to insert

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,560
neuronal tissues which can be either

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,159
organoids spheroids or just neurons in

72
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,440
suspension into a Matel there are then

73
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,159
two media compartment on the side and

74
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,680
after one day after the seing in one of

75
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,920
the two media compartment we can add

76
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,319
some Sy syringes in order to apply a

77
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,640
trans a trans flow uh after a few days

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,840
the cells of the BBB self arrange self

79
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,519
arrange into forming some perfusable

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,480
microvascular networks which can kept uh

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,400
which can be kept perable up to four

82
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,519
weeks after the desire amount of time we

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,680
can then perform different analysis for

84
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,159
example we can perform or can calculate

85
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,040
the permeability of the Bas crature uh

86
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,959
we can um perform some immun staining of

87
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,439
the cells in the microfluidic device to

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,280
maybe visualize some specific proteins

89
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,680
uh we can collect super Nan either from

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,680
the media compartment or from the

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,040
central compartment and we can also open

92
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,159
the chip extract the gel we can digest

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,920
it with some enzymes and then we can

94
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,720
isolate the single cells to perform some

95
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,959
sequencing PCR or wer

96
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,439
blotting in order to check if the

97
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,840
vasculature is perfusable we can perfuse

98
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,560
some FES and dextron and the vasculature

99
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,400
then look like in the picture on the on

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,760
the right and by perfusing Flores and

101
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,480
exr we can also calculate the

102
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,560
permeability by looking at the intensity

103
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,159
in The Matrix or in the vasculature over

104
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,799
over time and with these methods we can

105
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,799
also perfuse or we can also introduce a

106
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,319
variety of molecules and Therapeutics

107
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,560
and we can see the effect that they have

108
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,560
on the vasculature in the context of

109
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,680
Alzheimer disease we can add some

110
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,320
exogenous Amoy beta 42 which plays a key

111
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,840
role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,520
disease and is also a key biomarker for

113
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,039
the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease uh

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,560
and by increasing the the concentration

115
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,199
of Amo beta 42 we can see that there is

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,600
an increase also in the permeability of

117
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,160
the vulture but this is not yet a

118
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,720
culture with the neurons um in order to

119
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,880
do so we use some neural progenitor

120
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,759
cells which they carry familiar

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,840
Alzheimer disease mutation and they have

122
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,280
the ability they engineer in order to

123
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,560
express Amo beta 42 pathogenic Amo beta

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,759
we can culture these cells into Wells in

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,560
order to form some spheroids which can

126
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,160
be predifferentiated for 1 days and

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,759
after we can take them and put them in

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
the centrer compartment for the

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,320
co-culture with the

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,960
BBB after 7 Days of Co culture of the

131
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,960
Alzheimer disease neurosphere and the

132
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,880
control one with the BBB we see that

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,440
there is a significant increase in the

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,680
permeability for the uh neurosphere

135
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,880
carrying the Alzheimer disease mutation

136
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,919
and this effect is much stronger than

137
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,639
just by adding the exogenous Amo beta42

138
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,400
meaning there is an additional effect

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,240
given by the culture with the neurons in

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,520
addition add to the change in the uh

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,080
permeability we also have some

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,880
morphological changes of the microvasc

143
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,039
we see that there is overall a decrease

144
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,520
in the vessel diameter vessel length and

145
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,440
the vessel area

146
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,759
fraction um this is a uh image that

147
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,240
gives an overview of the chip where the

148
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,960
endothelia cells are stay in in in green

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,479
forming the microvascular and you can

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,759
see the central compartment with the

151
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,280
neurosphere inside on the left there are

152
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,400
the um control neurosphere the L one in

153
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,520
green and on the right the the one

154
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,759
carrying the ad mutation in red and in

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,199
this image We Stand also for Amo beta

156
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,919
Aggregates which are more visible in the

157
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,759
case when we have the culture with have

158
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,120
the neurosphere carrying the mutation

159
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,360
and which lead then to vascular

160
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,479
dysfunction in the conf experimental

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,199
configuration when we have the neurons

162
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,080
suspended in the mitel um we can see

163
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,639
also some Pau deposition after four

164
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,599
weeks of co-culture with the BBB and I

165
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,039
think it's really important to underline

166
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,639
the fact that being able to recapitulate

167
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,759
these two phenotypes so Amo beta

168
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,720
deposition and P deposition in vro is

169
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,560
really challenging but it's possible by

170
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,400
using this uh model that we

171
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,800
developed as I mentioned in the

172
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,039
introduction aging is a risk factor for

173
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,639
neurodegenerative diseases however

174
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:54,039
current model still fail to um take into

175
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,280
account Aging in one while developing

176
00:06:54,039 --> 00:07:00,400
the model um one main allk allmark of

177
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,720
Aging is cellular sence

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,639
which is a mechanism in which the cells

179
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,280
um basically is become PR is St

180
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,440
proliferating is resistant to apoptosis

181
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,319
and undergo morphological changes such

182
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,960
as flattening of the cells and also the

183
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,240
presence of multiple

184
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,759
nuclei um there is a strong interplay

185
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,800
between cellular syence and

186
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,840
neurodegenerative diseases and in

187
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
particular Parkinson disease shares some

188
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,280
of the mechanism that promote Cellular

189
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,639
sence in which in a viscious circle then

190
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,680
aggravates the uh progression of the

191
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,800
disease so for this reason it's really

192
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,400
important to develop a model that takes

193
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,680
into account the Aging factor and that

194
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,520
age match the condition of the brain

195
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,120
microvasculature at the onset of

196
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,360
neurodegenerative

197
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,520
diseases in order to induce in essence

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
there are different ways um the first

199
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,039
one is color replicative sence in which

200
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,639
the primary cells line are kept in

201
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,440
culture in order to be aged naturally

202
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,120
although this take quite some time

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,120
another wellknown method is to employ

204
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,560
the use of hydrogen peroxide which can

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,599
be add to the to the culture of cells

206
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,879
and this basically the addition of

207
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,599
hydrogen peroxide induce a inflammatory

208
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,680
state in the Cs which lead to premature

209
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,759
stenin um we test a different

210
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
concentration of hydrogen peroxide and

211
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,440
then we look at the amount of stenes

212
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,400
cell before and after the treatment

213
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,560
which was higher and then we also looked

214
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,759
at the main senin biomarkers or

215
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,840
phenotypes which are basically the

216
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,120
presence of nuclear damage DNA damage

217
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,240
the inflammatory state of the cells and

218
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,360
the cell cycle arrest which were all

219
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,440
confirmed after treatment with hydrogen

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,959
peroxide we then took a step further and

221
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,519
we treated the 3D

222
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,360
microvascular so once the microvasc

223
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,200
microvascular is formed we add hydrogen

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,279
perite for 5 days and then we look at

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
the permeability values which were

226
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,839
significantly higher compared to the

227
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,160
control case so the young BBB so with

228
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,240
this we were quite confident to have a

229
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:05,120
model of stence able to recapitulate the

230
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,760
um um the age uh brain micro environment

231
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
and that can be used then in culture

232
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,160
with the

233
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,120
neurons because of the um strong

234
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,079
interplay between Parkinson disease and

235
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,240
cellular sence we use some ipss deriv

236
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:21,079
human midbrain organoids which carry

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,560
familial PD mutations so these organoids

238
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,800
are able to secrete Alpha nucleus which

239
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,560
is a key protein in the pathogenesis of

240
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,000
Parkinson disease um these organoid are

241
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,720
differentiated up to 64 days and we

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,760
checked the effect that they have on the

243
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,720
uh microvasculature at different times

244
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,640
of

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,839
differentiation so at day seven day 21

246
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,839
and day 65 and we see that at day 65 the

247
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,519
permeability of the microvascular in

248
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,079
culture with these organoids was

249
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,800
significantly higher compared to the L1

250
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,320
so the next step in the project will be

251
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,000
to First Age the BBB with hydrogen

252
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,440
peroxide and then repeats the culture

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,279
with the organoids to see if there is an

254
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,240
additional effect or like um in the in

255
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:09,839
the um phenotype of of PD in the in the

256
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,160
reproducing the phenotypes of Parkinson

257
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,160
disease another really important goal of

258
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,600
the Consortium is the development of an

259
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,440
ipss derve sasone network of the human

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,839
BBB um

261
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,320
ipscs have revolutionized um in vure

262
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,600
research because of their capacity to be

263
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,959
almost unlimited expanded because they

264
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,440
can be um genetically engineered and

265
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,360
because they from them we can derive

266
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,279
almost the almost all somatic cell lines

267
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,560
and in the context of neurodegenerative

268
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,920
diseases is really attracting the fact

269
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,519
that we can derive patient specific IPS

270
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,880
CS with a real relevant genetic

271
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,040
background um in collaboration with the

272
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,560
whad Institute we were able to obtain

273
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,720
ipscs deriv parites asoc sites and the

274
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,120
NOA cells form in the BBB from the as1

275
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,200
ipsc cells and with this we were able

276
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,800
then to obtain an isogenic model of the

277
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,440
BBB similarly we can also derive some

278
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,200
ipc's midbrain and cber organoids and

279
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,320
then um have a co-culture of the

280
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,040
isogenic BBB with the organoids and see

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,440
if we can uh replicate or recapitulate

282
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,279
the uh phenotypes for specific

283
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,320
diseases we tested different

284
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,920
concentration of the Tre cells composing

285
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,560
the BBB the endoa the ASO and the

286
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,959
parites and we were able to obtain

287
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,639
perfusable networks with permeability

288
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,399
values comparable to the one of the BBB

289
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,920
culture with the primary cell lines and

290
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,839
interestingly by changing the ration of

291
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,000
the three cell types we were able to

292
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,959
tune and influence the vessel geometry

293
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,560
by reaching also some the vessel on the

294
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,800
right which are more capillary like and

295
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,279
More close to the invivo

296
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,040
situation at the same times uh we also

297
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,639
fully characterize the endothelia ipsc

298
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,639
endothelia says um making sure that they

299
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,519
work Express characteristic ipss marker

300
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,720
they were expressing OTAs and markers

301
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,760
and they were also really important that

302
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,880
they were not express any epar cell

303
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,000
markers and since we are also interested

304
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,079
in looking at the different transporter

305
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
routs in and out of the brain we also

306
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:20,240
look at the expression of the key

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,360
transporter which were confirmed so what

308
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,680
we are doing at the moment is to test

309
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,279
different transport of compounds in and

310
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,399
out of the microvascular networks and

311
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,639
also fully characterizing the ipss there

312
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,160
cerebral mid braing

313
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,519
organoids so with this I hope I convinc

314
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,320
you about the potential that our model

315
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,920
can offer into uh reproducing or into

316
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,440
modeling uh neur degenerative diseases

317
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,079
in betro uh I would like to thank all

318
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,839
the collaborators and colleagues that

319
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,199
work on the project and thank you all

320
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,199
for your

321
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,950
[Applause]

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,000
attention thank you anesca for that nice

323
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,760
introduction um to the project uh any

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,760
questions from the

325
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,240
audience thank you wonderful talk so can

326
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,079
we further add

327
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,639
micro like other immune cell part to the

328
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,199
MPS system so we can study the neuro

329
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,519
inflammation process yes so actually

330
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,800
that's what we are also doing at the

331
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:29,240
moment we can um at the white Institute

332
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,240
they can um culture the organoids with

333
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,000
microa in it and then the next step

334
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,120
would be also to look at the um at the

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,920
uh activation of microa in the case of

336
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,000
the neurod degenerative diseases so

337
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,190
that's what actually we are planning to

338
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,389
do yeah thank

339
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,389
[Music]

340
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:54,000
you excuse me sorry um I'd been handed a

341
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,680
microphone forgive me for a very naive

342
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,759
question um from some discussions with a

343
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,079
couple of farmer companies who've been

344
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:05,600
using AI for drug Discovery in these

345
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,320
areas they're producing compounds that

346
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,079
um have a higher percentage of which

347
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,560
have e efficacy uh

348
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:17,160
Effectiveness but also more of them turn

349
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,480
out to have uh to to be more

350
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,199
toxic particularly in animal models I

351
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,199
mean as as one of them put it to me

352
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:28,399
we're killing a lot of mice um and I was

353
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,079
wondering is this applicable to being

354
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,199
able to develop better models for

355
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,160
toxicity I think yes because we can

356
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,880
check the toxicity of the drug of the

357
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,199
compounds that we can add into the model

358
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,440
and the way the C responds in 3D

359
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,519
compared to 2D is quite different also

360
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,639
for the sesm model we see that the

361
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,079
effect of the hydrogen peroxide is

362
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,759
different in 2D or in 3D so that's

363
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,720
actually having this complex model would

364
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,920
help a lot in the looking at the

365
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,920
toxicity of drugs

366
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,560
to what extent are you able to do uh

367
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,920
sort of more mechanistic

368
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,399
characterization like at the end of this

369
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,160
co-culture period like how uh are you

370
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,600
able to isolate the different cell

371
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,920
populations that you've grown together

372
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,360
here and do um kind of deeper molecular

373
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,240
characterization um and uh have you been

374
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,959
able to uh yeah and how have you applied

375
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,440
that um to some of these disease models

376
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,399
yes um so as I mentioned in the

377
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,639
beginning we are able to obtain the say

378
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,839
from the from the gel and need with fax

379
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,839
or Max we can isolate the different cell

380
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,120
type composing the BBB so the Ayes ECS

381
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,839
and um parasites for the organoids we

382
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,560
have not yet tried to isolate the single

383
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,519
CS but I think there are antibodies that

384
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,720
we can use in order to sort them out um

385
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,759
we then when once we isolate the three

386
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,800
different cell type for the BBB we

387
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,279
submit them for sequencing and from that

388
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,040
we can obtain a variety of information

389
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,079
for the disease model and the control

390
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,920
the L one in order to compare compare

391
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,920
the two

392
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,720
so sorry if I missed it but are you do

393
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,279
you have the opportunity to test some of

394
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,959
the drugs that failed in your model soon

395
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:21,880
um it's a bit tricky um also

396
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:24,800
collaborating with uh I mean the

397
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,240
the the the one that are available yes

398
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,519
we could try them um it really depends

399
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,040
of the of also of the company

400
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,560
participate in the consultion because

401
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,199
some they cannot really share the

402
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,440
compounds that they are testing and use

403
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,440
so it's really also a bit

404
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,800
um we have to see into into that yes

405
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,519
because I'm sorry I'm not familiar with

406
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,160
the Consortium so I wasn't sure how many

407
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,319
industry Partners you have yes it really

408
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,120
depends of the rules inside the inside

409
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:52,120
the industry thank

410
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,399
you do you want to show briefly I think

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,800
you had a slide that said some of the

412
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,519
industry collaborators yes so we are

413
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,480
cating with taka isai

414
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,480
serono serono viser and
