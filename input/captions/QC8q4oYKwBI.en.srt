1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,880
Today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,279
peerguided learning at scale. Um the

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,400
thing I asked you to do for today was to

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,720
write a little bit in your learning

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,199
journal about um one of your hobbies

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,279
that you use online resources to learn

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,279
from. Um, so just get in groups of

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,279
three, um, and spend the first few

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,360
minutes talking to each other about what

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
kinds of, uh, hobbies you have and what

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,120
kind of online learning you do in those

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,120
hobbies. Does that make sense? Ready?

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Go.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,840
All right, come on back. Great

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
condition. So, first of all, Omar should

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,640
show us his camera. Do you want to talk

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,719
about um, so I I I talked about

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
photography? Like I spend an unhealthy

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
amount of time on YouTube like with

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,719
photography tutorials. And so this

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,280
camera is a 50-y old camera and I had no

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
idea um how to even begin looking for

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,760
one. And like these last three weeks

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,240
I've been looking because I want to run

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:10,080
a CPW event um for uh admits on how to

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,520
use an SLR camera. Isn't that cool? So I

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,119
don't know like this is in really great

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,040
condition and I was like on eBay for

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,880
hours but I you know watched YouTube

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,119
tutorials was reading on like Reddit

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,680
forums, photography forums, DP review,

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,520
pedopixel like on what to look out for

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
and before that like learning how to

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,759
actually take photos. Um was all done

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,680
through YouTube. It was selftaught. I

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,960
started off with a phone and then I

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,159
slowly built up um my toolbox once I had

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,320
the knowledge and yeah now I'm like the

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,920
photo editor for the tech. I stuff for

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,040
yearbook and now I do a lot of stuff for

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,200
photography and now I'm actually

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
teaching others. Um I recently actually

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,399
just interviewed up here this I

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,640
interviewed for to teach a digital

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,479
photography course although due to time

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,759
conflicts I won't be able to do that. Um

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,680
but I did interview and I um was about

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,320
to go on the other side of that um

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,680
learning experience.

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,360
Camera's rad. I just got it um before my

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,439
last class. So like I need to go to a

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,360
camera shop just to make sure it works.

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,160
um which I'll be doing after this class.

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,599
A photo of that. I want a photo a photo

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,599
of Omar with his new camera taken with a

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,599
contemporary.

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,360
Yeah. I I I mean those Polaroid cameras

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,720
became much more widely accessible

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,239
probably when I was in grade school.

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
Like they were pretty common and then

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,360
and then there was sort of a revival in

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,959
the last few years. So like my daughter

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,560
has a Polaroid camera. I don't think

64
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
it's called. We call them Polaroid

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
cameras because they probably have some

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
different term now of instant camera or

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
something like that. Um, anybody have a

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
completely different hobby from Omar

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,840
where you could tell a very similar kind

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,840
of story about learning

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
or I guess like you know similar sort of

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,239
story of learning is like you know

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,599
through YouTube right like I want to or

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm like starting to learn how to like

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,879
play guitar and bass and stuff. Um, but

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,400
the thing with YouTube is it's like we

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,840
talk about like algorithm guided

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
learning or whatever, but like it kind

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,920
of almost feels like YouTube's sort of

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,879
an algorithm kind of guided learning in

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,040
a way or like I feel like the YouTube

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,440
algorithm really sort of drives my

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
interests or like diverts my interests

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,720
into different things at different

85
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,640
periods of time. Like on a weekby- week

86
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,959
beek basis, I can be interested in

87
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,799
something completely different than what

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,400
I was interested in last week. So, it

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,560
feels like I like I'm just sort of

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
moving through a bunch of like different

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,680
hobbies and because I feel like I'm at

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,200
the whim of the YouTube algorithm

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,799
sometimes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,319
People Yeah. Yeah. No, I think people

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,040
feel that way with lots of uh kind of

96
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,480
technologies that do some kind of

97
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,400
aggregation. Pinterest for people who do

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,080
crafty kinds of things. Tik Tok for

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,239
people who follow media and stuff like

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,599
that. Yeah. Good. What other what other

101
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,680
hobbies do you talk about or what other

102
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
sort of learn like informal learning

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
strategies seem important and

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,680
interesting or things that you were

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,680
talking about in your groups?

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,879
Yeah. Awesome. I'll say like on a less I

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,840
guess handson like level. Um, I like use

108
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,479
like similar resources like YouTube and

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,239
stuff like that for like a lot of like

110
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,919
collecting knowledge for like things

111
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,759
that I'm interested in like fashion for

112
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,560
example because a lot of a lot of it is

113
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,479
like you know like like in New York

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,960
fashion week for example it's like these

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,800
very condensed times right where like

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,639
it's all happening and a lot of people

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
follow very closely but if you're an MIT

118
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,080
student you're probably like I can't

119
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,320
feeling

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,759
But like then you can like watch

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,800
highlights from it and like actual like

122
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,479
critics commentary on them and like kind

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,960
of see like what that's doing both

124
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,639
socially and also like from an artistic

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,120
sense. Yeah. Do you use Pinterest or

126
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,919
anything for sort of collecting your um

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm I've I had a social media

128
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:09,199
problem YouTube so now I've kind of just

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,039
continued into YouTube and stuff but I I

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,520
do get to I guess reflect on it because

131
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm doing costume designs and stuff. Oh,

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,520
cool. Yeah. My my my daughter is big

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,000
into aesthetics of various kinds, craft

134
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,919
things or design things. And Pinterest

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,280
is like a big part of how she like she

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,960
does the same kind of combing that you

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,479
does, but she's deliberate about taking

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,720
things that she likes and storing them

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,520
and categorizing them and trying to make

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,600
sense of them and things like

141
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,280
that. Yeah. Dana. And then I was just

142
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
going to say like just like another

143
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,000
medium outside of like watching videos

144
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,000
is just like online like so mine is like

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
cooking. So like recipes and just like

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
articles. Um, and then also like mine

147
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,440
was like a little bit of TikTok just in

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,960
like the one minute video of like you

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,400
can cook this and it like isn't a

150
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,520
professional chef showing you how to do

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,120
it was cool to see that like oh like I

152
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,240
can relate to that person so I can do

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,120
it. Um, what what what are your favorite

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,880
sort of recipe media or cooking media?

155
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,360
Like how do you So I've only perfected

156
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,560
one singular dish. Um, and it's

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,720
scallops. Um, which is like a relatively

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,160
hard thing, but like I'm scared to cook

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,479
a chicken because I'm gonna give myself

160
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,039
salmonilla a scallop.

161
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,160
Yeah. So, my family joke is you only

162
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,560
going to eat scallops for this. You're

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,039
like, "Yeah, they're pretty good.

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
They're healthy. Might be too many heavy

165
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,720
metals if you do that your whole life or

166
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,080
something like that." But yeah. Yeah. I

167
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,919
don't know if bottom feeders are what

168
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,240
you should do for your whole life, but

169
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,639
that seems like seems like a good start.

170
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,280
How about you, Armon? Uh I do mention

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,440
this in our group but what came out from

172
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,840
people talking like a lot of people

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,080
relate is number file uh stream blue one

174
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,560
brown this video I just put them in what

175
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,520
is this it's a maths video they just

176
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,840
tell you cool math stuff

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,440
it's called number file number file

178
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,400
street blue on brown those kind of

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,880
videos so sometimes you learn that there

180
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,000
is fractional dimension and you just be

181
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,319
watching what that means And I watch

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,880
those, too. So, they're really

183
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,479
interested. Um, yeah. Who's who's the

184
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,880
guy who came here a couple years ago for

185
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,280
a graduation or convocation or

186
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
something? Mark. Hm. Mark Robber. Mark

187
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,080
Robber. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. He's sort of

188
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,080
science YouTuber. Guy named Veritasium

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,960
does uh does things like that too. Yeah.

190
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Yeah. Enormously uh popular and

191
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,759
successful and things like that. Um I

192
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,000
play a lot of computer games and I my

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,120
life sort of overlaps. I don't know.

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
computer games are like a couple of

195
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,919
years older than me, but not by much. I

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
mean, definitely some of my earliest

197
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,319
memories are um games that would have

198
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,800
been played off of like a cassette reel

199
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,520
rather than any kind of rotary disc or

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,520
or something like that. Um but another

201
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,120
distinctive memory is that uh one of the

202
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,759
first categories of games were these

203
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,919
textbased games where you had to sort of

204
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,039
enter prompts into a parser like open

205
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,960
mailbox, go left, go right, walk in, you

206
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,400
know, pick up key, put key and lock,

207
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
those kinds of things. So, a lot of what

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,639
you're doing Yeah. Come on in. um was

209
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,479
kind of guessing like uh you know what

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,520
what was the what was the right key term

211
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,199
to put in to um to engage things and so

212
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,639
actually a lot of these games Infocom

213
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,639
was a company that sold a lot of them.

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,440
Um the game companies would also publish

215
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,120
a book and the book would have uh the

216
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,120
answers to a whole bunch of things or

217
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,599
like solution sets in invisible ink and

218
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
so you had like a little uh um pen that

219
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,160
came with it. And so when you decided

220
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,640
that you had given up trying for

221
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,159
yourself, you would uh you would cover

222
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,080
the invisible ink with this pen that

223
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,080
would reveal the sort of next clue and

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,919
help you go on and so forth. Um and uh

225
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
but now you know essentially every video

226
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,760
game it like they almost instantly are

227
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,600
created with a wiki that has you know

228
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,880
every item in the game and what they do

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,320
and where they go. Um a Reddit forum for

230
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,560
conversation. um more recently Discord

231
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
um pages, you know, that actually, you

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,240
know, for smaller games can be kind of

233
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,200
surprisingly intimate where you, you

234
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,880
know, you really do feel like you're

235
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
just like chatting with the guy who made

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
the game. Um even if you know, there may

237
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,839
not be responding to you directly, but

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
they're certainly like responding to

239
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,720
people that are there around with you

240
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
and things like that, YouTube channels

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,640
or all these kinds of things. Um yeah, I

242
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,000
think there I think there's all kinds of

243
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,399
ways. There ve there are very few

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,480
people I think left in theorked world

245
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,959
who don't have some kind of encounter

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,519
with this sort of informal learning. Um

247
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,519
I I I think you know just an enormous

248
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
number of people in a very short period

249
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
of time. I mean obviously there have

250
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,640
always been people who do DIY kinds of

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,920
things and stuff like that but the

252
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,279
degree to which online resources has

253
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,839
shaped those learning interactions um is

254
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,360
a profound change over the last uh

255
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,200
decade or two. The uh um and I think it

256
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,760
I think it reminds us to do a few things

257
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,920
that are useful. One is to um is to

258
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,680
conceptualize learning really broadly.

259
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,680
Um, you know, a lot of times that we

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,160
think of learning, we sort of we pin it

261
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,519
down in education, K12 education,

262
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
college, things like that, but that's

263
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,440
that's a relatively small part of

264
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,760
people's lives. Um, people are learning

265
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,920
all throughout their lives all the time.

266
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,360
Um, people are developing new skills for

267
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
work. They're developing new skills

268
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,560
around their interests. They're they're

269
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,160
they're pursuing passions. They're doing

270
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
whatever else. And so think I think it's

271
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,040
very helpful when thinking about online

272
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
learning to be really open um to all

273
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,120
these kinds of things. And then you know

274
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,040
I I would say if there's a core argument

275
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,880
in peerg guided learning at scale it's

276
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,920
that these technologies have been so

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,880
profound in changing the ways that we

278
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,880
pursue learning outside of school and

279
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,920
schools have proven to be institutions

280
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,839
that are just remarkably resistant um to

281
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,680
these forms of learning as well. Well,

282
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,320
my hunch is most of you don't have an

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,920
experience where you feel like, yeah,

284
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
the kind of learning that I did in my

285
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,279
eighth grade physics class was really

286
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,959
just like the kind of learning that I

287
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,040
did to learn photography or something

288
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,279
like that. Um, there's something about

289
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
schools um and the design and

290
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
organization of schools that makes it

291
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,839
really hard for these kinds of learning

292
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,040
environments to make their way in. Um, I

293
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,600
think a lot of what I want to share with

294
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,839
you today are some of the most

295
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,880
substantial efforts particularly in

296
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,600
higher education to figure out how some

297
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,880
of these approaches to um peer-guided

298
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,880
learning at scale could make their way

299
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,880
into formal institutions. Um I the ideas

300
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,480
that I am presenting to you when I you

301
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
know if I was talking about them 10

302
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,440
years ago I would have positioned them

303
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,839
more as these are very viable ways in

304
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,600
which at least higher education maybe a

305
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,839
number of forms of education might

306
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,560
substantially change in the next five or

307
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,040
10 years. Um and I think I will I'm more

308
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,360
likely to present you them today as an

309
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,959
interesting dead end. um as a set of

310
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,320
things that people were trying putting a

311
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,000
lot of effort behind putting a lot of

312
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,880
design behind and and really didn't have

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,200
um much impact in how especially higher

314
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,480
education Kate in how in how formal

315
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,040
education of all kinds are organized um

316
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
you know studying things that flop is is

317
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,320
good we're going to come back to this a

318
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
few different times studying things that

319
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,560
flop is really important to figure out

320
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,399
um why things work if you just study uh

321
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
things that work um you actually don't

322
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,440
know why they work you know the

323
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,639
characteristics I have, but but there's

324
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,920
lots of things that are in common

325
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,320
between things that work and things that

326
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,399
don't work. Um, and so that's what we'll

327
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,440
uh we'll delve into some today. Um,

328
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,560
maybe I'll talk for a little bit and

329
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
then see what kind of thoughts you have.

330
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,360
All right, so we are I think we did the

331
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,959
Rainbow Loom story. We talked about this

332
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
the other the other day. This is, you

333
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,560
know, one I think iconic moment of, you

334
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,399
know, the creation of a new craft

335
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,760
generates um these these new kinds of

336
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,279
communities. Um, this was from 2013. You

337
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,880
know, low tech but high in creativity.

338
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,399
The Rainbow Loom has kids hooked,

339
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,240
spending hours after school and on

340
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,480
weekends making bracelets, weaving

341
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,120
together small, colorful rubber bands on

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,279
a simple plastic loom. Um, and all of

343
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,440
the um the narrative around Rainbow Loom

344
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,360
was, man, look, we finally got kids off

345
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
their phones. Like, we finally got kids

346
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,279
in the real world connecting to one

347
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,639
another. You know, this is I think 2013

348
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,160
that this is published right before

349
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,320
Christmas. Um, but of course the kids

350
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,680
were were on their phones the whole time

351
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,079
that they were playing with Rainbow

352
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,839
Loom. And so this is Ashley and Steph um

353
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,360
who are these two girls, you know, who

354
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,320
have 200, you know, a quarter of a

355
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
million people subscribed to. Oh, this

356
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,040
is Yeah. How to make a Rainbow Loom

357
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
Starburst bracelet. When whenever I

358
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,519
recorded this um 30 million views, um

359
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
probably 10 times as many that were on

360
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,079
the official Rainbow Loom um Starburst

361
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,959
page that somehow these uh these two

362
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,240
kids had um captivated. I I don't know.

363
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,360
It's hard to say that it was millions of

364
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
people because it actually could have

365
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,880
been like a couple hundred thousand

366
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,320
people each watch this like 10 or 20

367
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,120
times because it's super hard to make

368
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:02,399
one of these bracelets. Um but uh um you

369
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,000
know I think a a compelling example of

370
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,920
how network learning was you know and

371
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,720
and and something like this if you're my

372
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,800
age you know looking at this in 2013

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,360
it's it's really hard to imagine

374
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,880
something similar happening in 1990 or

375
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,560
something like that. Like if someone had

376
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,720
invented a new kind of craft you would

377
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
have like had to go to a craft store.

378
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,519
You would have had to join a club. be

379
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,199
able to go to classes. There have to be

380
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,040
a college club or something like that.

381
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,440
Um there wouldn't, you know, I I mean,

382
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,639
you know, maybe PBS would put on a

383
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
television show about it. You'd have,

384
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,519
you know, you could imagine like the Bob

385
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,440
Ross of Rainbow Loom or something like

386
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,560
that. Um but uh you know, um very hard

387
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,320
to imagine the same kind of highly

388
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,440
decentralized

389
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,279
um uh mechanism by which learners

390
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,399
connect themselves to each other. I

391
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,880
think one of the things I'm going to ask

392
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,040
you to um read for an upcoming week, I

393
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,760
can't remember, it's next week. Um uh

394
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,079
but this uh piece by Ivon Illich called

395
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,040
Deschooling Society um I think it's

396
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,360
written in the 1960s. Um and he he

397
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,160
almost exactly with like the very dawn

398
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,120
of computing and he predicts learning

399
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,360
networks that that emerge like this. Um

400
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,639
he says you know one day I mean he has a

401
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,160
funny way of describing he says well you

402
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
know one day there's going to be a bunch

403
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,079
of learners um who write down the things

404
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,360
they're interested in learning on punch

405
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,560
cards because that's what computers at

406
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,120
the time and there's going to be a bunch

407
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480
of experts who share their interests on

408
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,240
punch cards and the computers are going

409
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,680
to connect these punch cards together um

410
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,680
and get people teaching and learning

411
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,880
from one another and like we it turned

412
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,720
out we had YouTube rather than punch

413
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,040
cards but um it was a pretty similar

414
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,880
kind of phenomenon um there are you know

415
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,959
in in the in the 20 in the early 2010s,

416
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,720
there were some people who were

417
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,920
particularly enthusiastic about the

418
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
fact, you know, so one thing about

419
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
Rainbow Loom you could say is something

420
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,399
like, well, all right, so some kids

421
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,199
figured out how to make plastic

422
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,480
bracelets. That's okay. Um, but there

423
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,800
are people who achieve like elite levels

424
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,079
of performance in a variety of different

425
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,480
disciplines and domains by following the

426
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,079
same kinds of practices that the Rainbow

427
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,399
Kids, Rainbow Kids were using. So, this

428
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
is a guy named Julius Jgo who, as I

429
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
recall, won a silver medal in the

430
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,839
Olympics. Um, he was from Kenya and he

431
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,920
was a javelin thrower. There are no

432
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,000
field athletes in Kenya. They're all

433
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,079
track runners. Um, and for whatever

434
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,079
reason, Julius Diego got it in his head

435
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,040
like, I'm going to be a javelin thrower.

436
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,480
Um, and uh, you know, I mean, here, you

437
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,959
know, my coach is me and the YouTube

438
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,560
videos. Um, and he became an elite, you

439
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,680
know, globally recognized ath. I mean,

440
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
there's a there's a there's a moment

441
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,320
where this tips. there's a moment where

442
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,440
he goes to um a track and field

443
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,639
competition um you know he doesn't

444
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
really have a coach and he throws a

445
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,040
javelin pretty far and some people

446
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,320
notice him and kind of take him under

447
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,240
his wing and stuff like that. So it's

448
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
not you know it's it's not just YouTube

449
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,160
videos that get you entirely to um being

450
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,800
the second best javelin thrower in the

451
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,079
world. Um but uh but going quite a long

452
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,079
way you know there's there's echoes of

453
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,920
this of the story that I told you before

454
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,079
of uh um Batush the boy genius of Ulan

455
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,559
Batar the the kid who sort of discovered

456
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,000
in Mongolia um through MITx and things

457
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,000
like this the idea that these could have

458
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,120
these profound democratizing effects

459
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,720
like you don't you know you don't have

460
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,079
to be um in in a country that has a

461
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,799
really big track and field

462
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,160
infrastructure um to be able to become a

463
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,280
great athlete. You can do it anywhere

464
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,720
because we have YouTube now.

465
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,960
Um, so in I I was working for Harvard X

466
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,559
in 2013. Um,

467
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,919
uh, maybe I, you know, maybe I'll pause

468
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,360
to tell this story, too. Well, I don't

469
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,000
know what the right order is now that

470
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm inspired by it, but um there was

471
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,200
this term massive open online courses

472
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,039
and it actually was not originally

473
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,400
applied to the courses that came out of

474
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,000
Corsera um and edex and MITx and Udacity

475
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,760
and things like that. There were a group

476
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,360
of Canadian educators who 2008, 2009,

477
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,080
2010, 2011 started building theseworked

478
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,760
courses. Um, some of the I'll go more

479
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
into the details of the network courses,

480
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
but you would basically kind of create

481
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,799
an online learning environment, have

482
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,640
people create blogs, connect on Twitter,

483
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
form social network connections with one

484
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,720
another and sort of all be studying the

485
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
same thing at the same time. Sometimes

486
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,520
some of the people would be getting

487
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,799
credit from some institution and other

488
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,880
people would not be getting credit. They

489
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,400
were all kind of openly being involved.

490
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
You know, a few thousand people,

491
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,480
probably the largest of these, um,

492
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,120
signing up. And so there was actually a

493
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
reporter who when um Edex and Corsera

494
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,640
got started was trying to figure out

495
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
what these things should be called. Um

496
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
and somebody said like well these

497
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,840
Canadian guys have these things called

498
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,440
massive open online courses. Um and the

499
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,000
name stuck but it stuck to describe

500
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
something very very different. Um, one

501
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,280
of the things that we recognized early

502
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,679
on is that is that in the early days of

503
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,679
people doing the massive open online

504
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,799
courses that came out of Harvard and MIT

505
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,400
is many of them were not just using the

506
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,080
course materials that were being

507
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,919
provided on these platforms, but they

508
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,520
were using all kinds of other things.

509
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
So, you'd ask people and they're like,

510
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,799
you know, um, yeah, well, we're

511
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,240
searching for all kinds of things that

512
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,080
show up. We're reading like the

513
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,919
Wikipedia entries about the things that

514
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,919
show up in these classes. We're buying

515
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,600
additional books that are around them.

516
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
Um, we're looking for those books on

517
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,200
Google books. We're joining Facebook

518
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,960
groups of people who are studying these

519
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,320
courses together and things like that.

520
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,799
Um, and so the the the the barriers

521
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,480
between these sort of instructorg guided

522
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,000
learning at scale, these like highly

523
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,559
structured learning management system

524
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,400
kinds of things and the sort of informal

525
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,880
world of people messing around on

526
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,720
YouTube learning about stuff um sort of

527
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,480
uh smooshed together. probably a bunch

528
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,559
of you have some kind of experience of

529
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,640
that in your classes too. I mean

530
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,919
presumably all of you like are like when

531
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,520
you don't understand something in class

532
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,440
you're looking up online videos about it

533
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,720
or you don't like the lecture and you

534
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
know probably mostly in your technical

535
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,919
classes you watch it from some other

536
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
place. I don't know do any of you join

537
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,120
groups or like find communities of

538
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,240
people who are good at at solving

539
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,480
problems and the things that you're

540
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,480
interested in.

541
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,600
One thing about being an MIT student is

542
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,039
you can go on OCW if you miss a lecture

543
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,320
or you don't understand the lecture you

544
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,400
want to explain in a different way from

545
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,720
a different professor just watch that

546
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,640
same lecture which I've done before for

547
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,880
some of my more technical classes. Yep.

548
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,240
So yeah, so you can rewatch sort of past

549
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,520
things. Some professors are sort of

550
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,559
pretty explicit about that. You know,

551
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,240
they'll be like, "Well, this is my

552
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,679
lecture, but like somebody else filmed,

553
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
you know, roughly the same course four

554
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,640
years ago, and so you can watch all

555
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,280
those things." Um, how many of your

556
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,760
classes still use Piaza or some kind of

557
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,360
discussion forum sort of things? Um, are

558
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,600
the are the Piaza forms ever

559
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,760
insufficient and then you go to Stack

560
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,440
Overflow or to some other kind of maybe

561
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,640
for your coding classes and things like

562
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,600
that? I would say Piaza has like a weird

563
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,400
social dynamic in itself. No, I want

564
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,880
that now. Tell me more.

565
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,200
I think it's like um I mean like

566
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,200
obviously you can both do like anonymous

567
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,159
questions and non-anmous question but

568
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,360
usually it seems like you know it it

569
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,840
really depends

570
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:08,559
on a little bit on like who's really

571
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:11,120
using it and also how responsive the

572
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,919
faculty and stuff are and how they

573
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,400
choose to respond because that I have

574
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,360
been in a in quite a few classes where

575
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,039
like

576
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,640
log on and then it's like yes I had that

577
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,480
question and they're like oh sorry we

578
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
boarded the question weird but then I've

579
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,720
also been quite a few classes where it's

580
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,039
like they're asking this like super

581
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,679
highlevel question about the lecture and

582
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,200
then it kind of sets that expectation

583
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,640
for the class especially if it's a

584
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,400
larger class of like oh like my like

585
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
quotequote dumb questions not going to

586
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,679
be answered yeah it's not going to be

587
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
kind of respected or things like that

588
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,000
yeah you know And um I mean because

589
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,480
these things are social in nature, I bet

590
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,799
a lot of those things can be determined

591
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,799
pretty early on by the actions of a

592
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,559
couple of people. Um when we were

593
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,280
studying Massive Women online courses,

594
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,320
one of the things we found in the

595
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,400
discussion forums, the largest threads,

596
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,480
the most upvoted kinds of things were

597
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,440
almost always amongst the very first

598
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,480
topics cho like posted. So, so it wasn't

599
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,320
like the forums were surfacing um like

600
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,240
it wasn't like there was lots of ideas

601
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,760
and the most interesting or important of

602
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,679
those ideas were surfacing at the top.

603
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,440
It was like somebody jumped in there

604
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,520
first and then people started talking

605
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
about those things, you know. Um and you

606
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,720
could imagine you could imagine an

607
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,320
alternate timeline of the exact same

608
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,159
course you're in where the first two

609
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,280
people to co post happen to just be

610
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,480
people who are like I don't understand

611
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,000
this really basic thing. Will someone

612
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,559
explain it again? And the forums have

613
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,400
sort of a whole different uh character

614
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,559
to them. I mean to some extent I think

615
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,600
of computer programming in particular as

616
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,440
a field that depends upon this kind of

617
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,760
informal learning that b like that

618
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,120
basically no one knows enough about

619
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,640
programming languages and how they

620
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,720
operate and how they solve problems and

621
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,039
so you you essentially can't do that

622
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,120
profession if you can't figure out how

623
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,320
to navigate all the online resources all

624
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,240
online communities and things like that.

625
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,520
And unusually um you can you can be pro

626
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,200
be promoted and thrive in those

627
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,559
communities through your participation

628
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,159
in some of these kind of informal

629
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,799
learning networks. You know you can be

630
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,080
really active I mean in creating open

631
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,400
source projects or just be a really

632
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,840
active contributor to Stack Overflow or

633
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,520
other kinds of communities like that get

634
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,360
recognized for your contributions and

635
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,760
have that translate into other kinds of

636
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,480
opportunities. So um the boundaries

637
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,760
between um there there are ways that I

638
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,880
think these informal learning

639
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,880
environments and formal learning

640
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,120
environments the boundaries can permeate

641
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,200
even if as we'll keep talking about like

642
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,559
just trying to take the whole informal

643
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,880
peer guided learning infrastructure and

644
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,760
bring it into schools seems not to to

645
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,120
work pretty well.

646
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,240
Um uh you know I think one of the

647
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,039
actually one of the most compelling

648
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,360
reasons for integrating technology into

649
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,679
people's school learning at all is the

650
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,559
idea that actually for most of your

651
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,480
lives the kind of learning that you do

652
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,320
will look more like the learning around

653
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,840
your hobbies than it does look like the

654
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,440
learning in your classes. You know in in

655
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,799
the next couple of years some of you

656
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,799
will keep taking classes for a long long

657
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,640
time but most of you will probably stop

658
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,159
um or take them only infrequently. You

659
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,760
will probably however continue um to

660
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,200
participate in these online learning

661
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,279
communities. To me it raises really

662
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,320
interesting questions like you know what

663
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,440
responsibility does a school have for

664
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,279
helping people become really good um you

665
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
know at learning cooking through playing

666
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,360
with recipes the way Dana described or

667
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,320
or learning photography um through

668
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,400
online forums or music through uh online

669
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,919
videos in the way that that Jiren and

670
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,559
Omar described. like what what would

671
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,640
what would a K12 education look like if

672
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,120
someone left school and they were like,

673
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,480
I'm totally prepared to teach myself

674
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,600
stuff by engaging these online

675
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,440
communities because I've had a bunch of

676
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,760
practice in those sorts of things. What

677
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
would a what would a college education

678
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,880
look like if it was good at that? I feel

679
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,120
like that's like such an interesting

680
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,760
point because I like think back to a

681
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,000
conversation I had with my mom where she

682
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,760
like grew up and was out of college or

683
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
out of high school like right before the

684
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
like really dawn of like computer

685
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,080
classes in high school and middle school

686
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,760
and like in middle school so like

687
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,520
rudimentary to us we like learn how to

688
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,919
use an Excel sheet and like just learn

689
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,440
how to like Google things um and like a

690
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,039
lot of just like the super basic skills

691
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,440
like how to type on a computer a

692
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,120
computer like keyboard that she doesn't

693
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,120
know how to do and it almost seems like

694
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,880
the next generation will like leave

695
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,200
computer classes like knowing how to

696
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,279
navigate these sites and like then all

697
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,360
the stuff that I had to learn on my own

698
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,799
like maybe I'm asking my kids like where

699
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,600
did you learn that and they're just like

700
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,200
in school. Um there was a phrase that

701
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,000
was used for a number of years that was

702
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,760
called digital native. Um the idea maybe

703
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,039
maybe a more common you know phrase that

704
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,039
you'll hear probably in the next few

705
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,159
years will be something like AI native.

706
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,640
um the idea that like what's the

707
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,720
difference between having to learn

708
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,559
something by by having it come into you

709
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,840
into your into your life versus like

710
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,279
having it be something that you kind of

711
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,720
grow up with all the time. There's

712
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,480
actually a bunch of good evidence that

713
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,679
in fact that digital natives that young

714
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,520
people are actually not that much better

715
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
at using technology especially learning

716
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,200
things than older folks. Um you know

717
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,120
young people in schools are usually

718
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,559
pretty good at doing certain kinds of

719
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,520
technology mediated things but the

720
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,120
things that are most helpful for

721
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,760
learning they're often no better at than

722
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,279
sort of anybody else. Um although I'

723
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,640
I've always liked the idea you know one

724
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,480
of the things that comes along with the

725
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,159
idea of immigration of digital natives

726
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,480
and so digital immigrants and digital

727
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,640
natives is that uh um you know second

728
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,000
generation immigrants are always taking

729
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,600
on new responsibilities for teaching

730
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,520
their first generation parents about

731
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,440
things you know you like you you grow up

732
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
in a country and you learn the language

733
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,919
you learn the culture you know other

734
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,039
kinds of things that you sort of have to

735
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,799
explain to your parents so there's

736
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,200
something kind of nice about um that

737
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,880
metaphor carrying over

738
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,520
um something that I know state of

739
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,600
Massachusetts is doing is um I don't

740
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,679
know if I completely agree with it um

741
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,919
blending computer science and computer

742
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,080
literacy together. I do think that

743
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,720
teaching computer literacy is of utmost

744
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,919
importance. Um I credit a lot of my um

745
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,679
computer literacy to my seventh grade

746
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,400
seventh and eighth grade technology

747
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,799
teacher. Um you know the link that I use

748
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,720
now was created back in seventh grade.

749
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,480
use is the very same account and he was

750
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,799
the one who got me um I think I

751
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,919
mentioned the typing lessons like the

752
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,760
beginning of the class that's where I

753
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,679
learned how to type um that's where I

754
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,640
learned how to um create a portfolio

755
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,480
create an online website um do like

756
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
individual kind of research and like

757
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
create a project on something that I'm

758
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,120
interested about um and I think creating

759
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,159
projects on something that's is like

760
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,799
personal to someone within a K through

761
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,000
12 um lesson is really important for

762
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,799
teaching them how to like conduct

763
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,880
research

764
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,120
take notes and uh come up with

765
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,200
conclusions on what they've um gone up

766
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,919
and looked for online. And a constant

767
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,400
challenge educators have is what new

768
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,000
things are actually worth investing

769
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,960
additional discretionary time in. I

770
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
mean, there were, you know, plenty of

771
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,720
folks 10 years ago who said, man, it's

772
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,080
incredibly important. Every high

773
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,440
schooler should complete a MOO. MOUKs

774
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,880
are going to be absolutely essential to

775
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,000
how people learn and finish higher

776
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,120
education in the future. If you can't do

777
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,279
a MOO, you're really going to be left

778
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,200
out. It's like, well, maybe not so much.

779
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,480
turned like a LinkedIn profile however

780
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,240
many years later still seems like a

781
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,039
pretty handy thing to have. There is no

782
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,720
reason 10 years ago that you could it's

783
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,559
very easy to imagine a world where

784
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,000
LinkedIn got replaced by something else

785
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,159
entirely and mukes were super important

786
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,720
like in 2013 the success paths of those

787
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,799
things were not at all predictable. Um

788
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,840
uh educators are super anxious about I I

789
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,880
just gave it Aaron came to this

790
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
conference with me. I gave a talk to a

791
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,640
bunch of educators about AI and

792
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,120
education on Monday. Um and there's a

793
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,720
ton of anxiety about like how important

794
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,159
are these things? What what do we not

795
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,679
need? Does it make sense to teach kids

796
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,120
the same way to search anymore? If you

797
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,039
know, AI agents are just going to answer

798
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,080
our questions for us or do we is it more

799
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,760
important to be able to do that because

800
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,520
the AI agents are going to say nonsense

801
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
to us? Um all these all these kinds of

802
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,159
things. Yeah. Ty, in that Oh, sorry. In

803
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,799
that regard, like do you consider AI a

804
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,080
form of like peer learning because it's

805
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,000
been trained on pure community like

806
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,480
stack overflow, all these other things.

807
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,840
Question. Oh, so my first thing about AI

808
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,760
um uh I was giving a talk with Jim Waldo

809
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,679
um who's the who was the chief technical

810
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
officer at Harvard. He's a neat guy um

811
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,279
because he got he got a PhD in

812
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,360
philosophy about 40 years ago then went

813
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,559
and worked at Oracle, helped write Java.

814
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,240
If you have an Android phone, you're

815
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,720
probably running his code on it. Um and

816
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,760
then he came back um and now he does

817
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,600
policy stuff and he's sort of a

818
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,520
philosopher again, but he's like AI what

819
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,679
do you AI is what we call computing

820
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,840
technologies that are new and we don't

821
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,120
understand very well. Um, and 10 years

822
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,559
from now, they won't be called AI

823
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,960
anymore. Um, and so, uh, you know, like

824
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,000
are generative pre-trained transformers

825
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,399
peer communication? Well, you know,

826
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,520
maybe, um, you know, if like what do I,

827
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,840
what do I think? What do I think a

828
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,559
peer-guided network is? Um, a learner

829
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,600
enters a network with a wide range of

830
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,000
learning resources that are generated by

831
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,520
previously all human agents. Um, could

832
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,760
an a, you know, could a generative

833
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,919
pre-trained transformer generate a

834
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,360
useful learning sequence? Seems

835
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,679
plausible. Um, you know, I I I remain

836
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,240
not entirely convinced. I I actually

837
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,320
what somebody came up to me and was like

838
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,000
like we're like we have a startup where

839
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,919
we're creating online classes by having

840
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,159
AI create the classes. And I was like,

841
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,840
that just sounds like a terrible idea.

842
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,679
In part because there's just such a huge

843
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,880
surfet of classes. Like there's so many

844
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,880
things out there and they're really not

845
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,480
unfortunately that expensive to develop.

846
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,399
Um like why do you mean machines to do

847
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,520
them? Um

848
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,760
uh I have a I have a colleague uh

849
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,960
um Carolyn Ros who worked with chat bots

850
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,760
for decades. Um

851
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,760
uh and and she actually she's has

852
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,480
convinced me to be very skeptical of

853
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,559
interactions of individuals with chat

854
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,840
bots. Um like I don't know how many of

855
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,000
you in the last week spent more than an

856
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,360
hour talking to a

857
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,880
chatbot. Zero, maybe one. Um I just

858
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
don't think people like it that much. Um

859
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,200
she really thought that where they could

860
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,360
be powerful is jumping in in the

861
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,039
conversations between two people. Um

862
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,240
that you just have peers talking to each

863
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,760
other. So you're on this discussion

864
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,960
forum and you're going back and forth or

865
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,440
other things like that and then a bot

866
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,279
comes in and sort of helps you um ask an

867
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,320
interesting question. Get like oh look

868
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,520
somebody over here has a different

869
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
perspective on that. Let me connect you

870
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,520
to that. and so you can talk and things

871
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,600
like that. Um, but yeah, it totally I I

872
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,440
think I think it totally seems plausible

873
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,240
that a peer guided learning environment

874
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,679
could include, you know, artificial

875
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,159
agents that are doing things that humans

876
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,760
had previously been doing.

877
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,440
Yeah, I guess to like both your points

878
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,720
of like a interaction, I I would say um

879
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,960
um an interesting aspect of that

880
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,799
especially in terms of like what can be

881
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,440
a credible source for learning and stuff

882
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,840
like that. So, I think in California, or

883
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,320
at least the the the part of California

884
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,960
I was in for a while, we did have like a

885
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,840
middle school little like a week-l long

886
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,240
program that every kid had to do that

887
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,679
was like, "Oh, you're 13. Here, make an

888
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,760
email and here's how you Google stuff."

889
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,600
Um, and like recently with um the new

890
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,600
Google AI feature that kind of

891
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,640
summarizes answers for you. Now, I was

892
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,559
like thinking about like um how does

893
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,919
that

894
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:09,360
change kind of those levels of

895
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,519
instructions? Because sometimes I look

896
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,519
up things and I see the summary and I'm

897
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,480
like I don't know what the answer is but

898
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,720
I know it's not

899
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,039
that and I and I go deeper. But like

900
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,440
let's say if I'm a middle schooler and

901
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,360
it's like well I don't learn this or I'm

902
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,279
a high schooler that took that class in

903
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,519
middle school and it's like well now I'm

904
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:33,600
not sure or I take Bard's word for good.

905
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah. Yeah. No, a hu a huge problem with

906
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,760
GPT generated text is that it's probably

907
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
much more useful for experts than for

908
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,240
noviceses. Um, so if you're an if you

909
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
know you ask a GPT to make eight things

910
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,760
and and two of them are cool and six of

911
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
them are nonsense or the opposite, an

912
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,559
expert can tell the difference and be

913
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,000
like, "Oh, that was an idea I didn't

914
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,200
have before." But a novice can't. A

915
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
novice just looks and be like, "Okay,

916
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,080
these are eight ideas. They all seem

917
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,279
plausible and they're confidently stated

918
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,720
and things like that." It's a huge

919
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,440
problem that educators are going to have

920
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,919
to wrestle with um in the in the years

921
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,159
ahead.

922
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:08,080
Um it's, you know, the kind of class

923
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,799
that you're describing, um if if it were

924
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,399
to be taught 10 years ago, a big thing

925
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,960
that educators were thinking about at

926
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,960
the time was how are people going to

927
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,559
navigate a social web? Um so, um when

928
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,760
when the web was first developed, we'll

929
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,200
get into this a little bit more, it was

930
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,799
pretty hard for people to contribute to

931
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,880
it. Um you had to know a little bit

932
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,480
about FTP, you had to know a little bit

933
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,320
about HTML, a couple other things like

934
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,080
that. They weren't like super hard, but

935
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,080
there was a relatively small portion of

936
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,559
the population that added content to the

937
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,240
internet. Um, and there were suite of

938
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,880
technologies that got bundled and called

939
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,720
web 2.0. Um, which said, okay, we're

940
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,880
going to make it much easier for anybody

941
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,799
to type things online. You can all start

942
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,880
a blog. You can all start a micro blog.

943
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,240
You can all make a simple website. You

944
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,399
don't have to know how to code to do any

945
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,320
of these things. Um, we're gonna we're

946
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,919
going to use user interfaces to take

947
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,480
away all that sort of programming

948
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,399
expertise that's necessary. And so

949
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,559
people thought, "Wow, you know, I bet

950
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,760
our lives are going to and you know,

951
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,679
young people's lives." If you, you know,

952
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,919
if you were teaching 11 year olds, 12

953
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,040
year olds in 2013, you thought, man, a

954
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,399
major thing they're going to have to do

955
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,679
is how to connect and network with each

956
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,599
other. We have to have them create their

957
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,280
LinkedIn page um so that they know how

958
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,800
to social network with each other. We

959
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,639
have to have them um, you know,

960
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,760
participate in online dialogues. We have

961
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,359
to have them think about what are

962
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,440
responsible ways of representing

963
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,159
themselves. Um people talk a lot about

964
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,119
their digital footprint um and other

965
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,399
kinds of things like that. Um you know

966
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,800
today a 13-year-old is entering a web

967
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,960
environment in which there are lots of

968
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,119
parts of social media which are

969
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,800
collapsing. Um that uh um you know just

970
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,800
as an example actually I was I went to

971
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,919
the guy who ran this conference on

972
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,000
Monday and well it was kind of so there

973
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,520
were usually this conference get 100 or

974
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,599
150 people show up. It was about AI.

975
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,839
They had 240 people show up and 70 folks

976
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,359
were on the wait list. Um, tons and tons

977
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,400
of interest from educators. And I and I

978
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,599
went to the guy who runs it, Tom

979
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,960
Driscoll, and says, "What do you think

980
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,320
these teachers are interested in? Like

981
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,079
what are you like, what do they want to

982
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,800
know? Why are they here?" Um, and he's

983
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,599
like, "You know what? I don't know." Um,

984
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,280
10 years ago, they would have had blogs.

985
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,480
They would have, you know, participated

986
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,839
in forums. They would have joined

987
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,040
Facebook groups. they would have sort of

988
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,720
like um uh they had there were many many

989
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,200
more ways that educators were

990
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,200
proactively um contributing their ideas

991
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,359
to the web. Maybe not all of them. Maybe

992
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,480
it was you know 10% of them or 20% of

993
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,640
the time but enough of them that you

994
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,119
could kind of get the pulse of a whole

995
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,000
community. Um which he felt like and I

996
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,960
agree you really can't do anymore. Um

997
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,920
some of that is that there was there was

998
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,320
a moment in web 2.0 know in which people

999
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,000
believed that the infrastructure of the

1000
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,640
web might be really quite open and quite

1001
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,800
owned um or controlled by individual

1002
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,720
people um that there could be a world

1003
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,720
where people create their own websites,

1004
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,400
they create their own blogs, they host

1005
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,119
their own accounts and things like that.

1006
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,800
Um and uh you know I don't know when

1007
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,800
some of these things starting around

1008
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,280
2015 2016 people started describing um

1009
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,839
the web we lost a kind of a kind of

1010
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,280
moment in which social media took a turn

1011
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,040
um uh you know so these are the kinds of

1012
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,760
things that like I don't know I was

1013
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,920
playing around with in 2004 2007 any of

1014
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,520
you have a live journal blog as one of

1015
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,880
the early sort of blogging sites people

1016
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,280
like create their own space and hosting

1017
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,119
it this was a wordpress.com blog of my

1018
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,640
wife and I you know, writing little

1019
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,480
stories about us, going on adventures

1020
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,880
and things like that. Um, posting

1021
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,880
pictures, hosting it ourselves. Um, and

1022
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,000
essentially Facebook came and sort of

1023
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,839
demolished all this. Um, and said, you

1024
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,040
know what, like you don't need to host

1025
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,720
your own blog. You don't need to um, you

1026
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,480
know, you don't need to like figure out

1027
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,160
an FTP server to upload your own

1028
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,680
pictures or use a picture interface.

1029
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,680
Like we're going to create an interface

1030
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,440
there. people participate in a lot of

1031
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,880
the same kind of practices on Facebook

1032
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,320
of writing little stories on the trips

1033
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,839
they do and posting pictures and stuff

1034
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,599
like that. But all of a sudden it was

1035
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,760
all controlled by Mark Zuckerberg. Um

1036
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,200
this was a quote from David Weinberger.

1037
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,280
In many ways Facebook fulfilled the

1038
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,920
dream of blogging but like not exactly

1039
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,560
like like everybody was online but they

1040
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,280
weren't in spaces that they owned, had

1041
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,079
control over, had some familiarity with.

1042
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,720
Um and then um we'll talk about some of

1043
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,839
this as it goes along. Um, I think there

1044
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,079
was a there was a moment in which

1045
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:30,320
participation in a broad online life

1046
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,720
felt much less toxic and draining and

1047
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,880
vulnerability inspiring as it does right

1048
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,720
now. Um uh you know I mean if if there

1049
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,400
are there if you're a teacher who's

1050
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,200
working in a state which has recently

1051
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,640
passed a divisive concepts law um or

1052
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,000
other things like that regulating the

1053
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,079
kinds of topics you can talk about and

1054
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,640
things like that like all of that has a

1055
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,119
sort of chilling effect um you know not

1056
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,880
I mean not to mention just the the ways

1057
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,560
in which you know the social media

1058
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,480
services Facebook Twitter other kinds of

1059
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,079
things we use have sort of degraded um

1060
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,079
in their conversations over time um uh

1061
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,800
you This is what David Weinberger said.

1062
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,720
The bloggers field did not scale. Um

1063
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,240
like like there you know some people

1064
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,640
created their own blogs but not

1065
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,480
everyone. Um and then Facebook came in

1066
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,760
and many people who created blogs like

1067
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,880
I'll just post to Facebook. A lot of

1068
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,720
those people have like moved over to

1069
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,320
Substack now or other kinds of things

1070
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,400
like that but but systems that they

1071
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,119
don't control. Um there is I think a

1072
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,720
parallel to that story that happened in

1073
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,440
higher education. Um so in the early

1074
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,160
days um when the web was first made

1075
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,839
available broadly to schools which also

1076
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,720
h you know happens to overlap with my

1077
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,680
life. So I I think in 1993 Dartmouth

1078
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,000
College is the first college to give um

1079
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,079
every incoming student an email address.

1080
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,320
I think in

1081
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:52,480
1994 very quickly many many other

1082
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,240
colleges had done that. By the time I

1083
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,040
graduated high school but certainly by

1084
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,320
the time I was into college in 1996 um I

1085
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,440
had an email address. everybody else

1086
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,880
would have had an email address. That

1087
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,960
would have been, you know, um pretty

1088
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,040
pretty universal and standard. Um but

1089
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,400
this is what university web pages looked

1090
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,680
like at the time. Um MIT still has some

1091
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,520
of these kinds of things. Has anybody

1092
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,839
ever been to somebody's tilda space? You

1093
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,839
know,

1094
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,839
www.mmit.eduilda jri or something like

1095
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,200
that. Who do you um Oh man, the 1806

1096
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,480
professor. What's what's his

1097
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,640
forgetting? Um the one who just retired

1098
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,920
Gil String. Good. Perfect. Great. Others

1099
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,200
that people can think of who have these

1100
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,400
things? So, um um so some things that

1101
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,440
you'll notice about the Well, I don't

1102
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
know. What do you just looking at these

1103
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,079
pictures? What do you notice about these

1104
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,359
things? What strikes you about them?

1105
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,680
There were some giggles before, which I

1106
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,680
think is appropriate.

1107
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,320
Like everything is

1108
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,560
okay. So, you know, not a lot of font

1109
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,560
diversity. What else?

1110
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,640
There's no advertisements. Yeah. Good.

1111
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,640
No, these are so so these were not

1112
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,599
created like with Wix or something like

1113
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,880
that where in exchange for making a

1114
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,160
website you have to put a bar of

1115
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,119
advertisements at the bottom or

1116
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,720
something like that. So somebody

1117
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,800
actually made these pages. They're all

1118
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,960
personal homepages. Other things that

1119
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,960
strike you?

1120
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,680
The backgrounds. What about the

1121
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,440
backgrounds?

1122
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Um it's certainly of like I don't know.

1123
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,480
I I feel like I I personally associate

1124
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,240
them with a very specific time period.

1125
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
Okay, good. It's like this is natural.

1126
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,079
They they have they have a '9s aesthetic

1127
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:36,040
to them. Yeah. I would say maybe it is

1128
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:39,440
like partially just like the quality of

1129
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,760
like like let's say a pattern or

1130
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,280
something you can put on or like now we

1131
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,440
have a lot of templates that make sure

1132
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,160
it's like aesthetically consistent. This

1133
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,200
is pre-CAva. We're not we're not uh Ken,

1134
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,320
what were you going to observe? Oh, I

1135
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,680
was about to say about the templates

1136
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,599
like they're not all using the exact

1137
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,520
same uh template and similar formatting.

1138
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,920
They're not all using the exact same

1139
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,240
template in similar formatting. I think

1140
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,400
that that is actually quite important.

1141
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,520
Um there are some good things that

1142
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,119
templates do of make things looking um

1143
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,960
uh aesthetic. Um but they standardize in

1144
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,640
a way. They they put things in the same

1145
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,319
way. People at universities do really

1146
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,839
really different kinds of things. That

1147
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,800
might be important. Other observations

1148
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,560
about these? It's very speromorphic. Um,

1149
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,040
like there's buttons on the the bottom

1150
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,520
left one with like icons that you don't

1151
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,359
see as often. And I want to say the

1152
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,920
background, especially the bottom left,

1153
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,200
reminds me of a a physical wallpaper.

1154
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,960
Uhhuh. Um, which is like a principle. Do

1155
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,680
you want to define skuorphism for us?

1156
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,040
Skeorphism is

1157
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,359
like the most famous example. It's

1158
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,920
probably like iOS 6 where you have all

1159
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,440
these buttons and like reflections that

1160
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,960
sort of try to mimic real life. And

1161
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,560
that's like what skuomorphism is trying

1162
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,040
to mimic real life. And then when we

1163
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,200
transition to iOS 7, you removed a lot

1164
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,680
of that dimension and it became a lot

1165
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,160
more simplistic and and symbolic. A lot

1166
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,560
of the early note-taking apps would have

1167
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,640
a background like a yellow legal pad or

1168
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,599
or like a spiral binding on the side or

1169
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,520
something like that and you're like,

1170
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,280
"Brother, we could put the we don't need

1171
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,640
the lines. Like the cursor will do that

1172
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,079
for you." Um but um people wanted to

1173
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,760
make some kind of connection between

1174
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,280
what they saw be you know what they saw

1175
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,160
in the physical world and what this new

1176
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,760
digital thing was trying to do.

1177
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,200
Skeumorphism shows up in that book

1178
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,319
somewhere. I can't remember now where I

1179
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,680
wrote about it but um um yeah I mean

1180
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,440
obviously these pictures are just

1181
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,560
outstanding. Um

1182
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,440
uh just like people had kind of like a

1183
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,119
cool

1184
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,200
idiosyncratic

1185
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,359
um personalized kind of a bane in the

1186
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,839
butt to organize sort of blogosphere

1187
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,000
that existed that Facebook just came and

1188
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,079
sort of demolished and homogenized and

1189
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,920
standardized and pulled out of the

1190
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,240
control of individual people's spaces

1191
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,720
and into this sort of corporate space.

1192
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,640
Um, you could say that Blackboard did

1193
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
something very very similar to campus

1194
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,280
web pages. Um, that learning management

1195
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,520
systems came along um and they said,

1196
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,880
"We're gonna standardize it all." Um,

1197
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,720
you you don't have you don't have to

1198
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,400
create your own page anymore. Like

1199
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,040
Blackboard will create your own faculty

1200
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,640
page, create your own course page. Um,

1201
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,400
and that's going to come with some kind

1202
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,440
of benefits of standardization. It's

1203
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,000
going to make it a lot easier for

1204
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,880
people, but it's but it's also going to

1205
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,040
get rid of um some of the kind of

1206
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,560
wonderful

1207
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,839
idiosyncrasies um of these things. And

1208
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,560
it's going to mean that there's a

1209
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,240
corporate entity who is who is not

1210
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,920
accountable who's accountable to their

1211
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,680
shareholders and not accountable to the

1212
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,000
same values that we might have as a

1213
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,599
university, which is deciding what those

1214
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,160
things look like. Much like when we move

1215
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,440
all of our blogs onto Facebook, um you

1216
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,119
don't even you're not even accountable

1217
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,200
to shareholders. are just accountable to

1218
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,240
whatever Mark thinks you know people

1219
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,920
should be doing in Facebook. Um yeah, in

1220
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,520
many ways Blackboard fulfilled the dream

1221
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,119
of the university till the spaces did

1222
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,480
not scale. I believe the problem could

1223
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,480
have been solved but then Blackboard

1224
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,520
happened. Um why would Blackboard

1225
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,119
happen? Um these are the instructions

1226
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,880
for Sunni onion about how you would go

1227
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,359
about creating one of your tilda space

1228
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,040
pages. you know, log into AAD, create a

1229
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,680
directory, change to this directory,

1230
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,760
create HTML documents, um, HTML

1231
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,040
developers jumpstation, you know, set

1232
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,640
pro equals w file namex. You can like

1233
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,240
you read about a page of this stuff and

1234
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,920
you're like, "Yeah, I can see why a lot

1235
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,079
of people, you know, like why launching

1236
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,200
a Blackboard page might be uh might be

1237
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:31,200
fine." Um,

1238
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,359
uh, uh, this is what the um, what is

1239
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,880
this

1240
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:37,040
blackboard? I don't I don't remember

1241
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,680
what uh learning management system this

1242
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,280
was. Maybe it's Canvas. It's not Canvas.

1243
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,800
I don't I can't remember what it is now.

1244
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,599
This is the this is the very first

1245
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,560
version of a sort of a version of this

1246
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,960
course um that I taught 10 years ago. Um

1247
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,599
and this is the this is the page that

1248
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,680
the that the system generated for me um

1249
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,040
when I first created the class. So it

1250
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,040
comes with a bunch of these sort of st

1251
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,040
not not this stuff that I added but

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,200
know this is what the standard format of

1258
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,359
this learning experience should be um

1259
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,640
but maybe that's not at all what I want

1260
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,800
it certainly doesn't make a lot you know

1261
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,880
if I had if I had taught this class

1262
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,560
about this was in an education school if

1263
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,200
I had made this class about education

1264
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,720
technology ology about um the experience

1265
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,000
of indigenous kids learning on

1266
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,520
reservations about um I don't know the

1267
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,200
uh um global education policy um

1268
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,280
intermediate statistics it all would

1269
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,880
have been the exact same format um they

1270
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,040
would have given the same sort of

1271
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,880
standardized creation for this which

1272
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,400
just in lots of you know it makes sense

1273
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,680
in some kind of ways and it's bonkers in

1274
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,359
other kinds of ways our courses are

1275
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,880
super different why should all of our

1276
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,720
courses have the same template why

1277
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,800
should we all be sort of subtly

1278
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,079
invisibly squished into teaching our

1279
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,480
courses the same way um by by these

1280
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,880
kinds of structures. Um and of course

1281
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,920
there's all kinds of physical analoges

1282
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,960
to this too. Um the the way we design

1283
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,520
environments shapes the learning

1284
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,280
experiences um that happen in the I just

1285
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,440
read a beautiful sentence of this which

1286
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,440
is you know something like um it was

1287
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,079
something like buildings have agenda for

1288
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,520
their occupants. um the way that spaces

1289
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,000
are created, like it doesn't tell you

1290
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,240
what to do, but it certainly guides you.

1291
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,240
You know, you walk into a room like this

1292
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,920
um and you have some thoughts about the

1293
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,440
kind of learning that's going to happen

1294
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,400
in that space. Like, well, you're all

1295
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,440
going to be facing in the same

1296
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,800
direction. Probably not going to be

1297
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,280
talking to a whole each other a whole

1298
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,640
lot um in that space. There's some, you

1299
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,560
know, you're going to be writing with

1300
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,720
certain kinds of physical materials. If

1301
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,480
you try to use a laptop on those, uh,

1302
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,839
you know, square square tables, you'll

1303
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,359
have a hard time, you know, there's no

1304
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,800
room for power cords or other kinds of

1305
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,119
things like this. Um this is actually

1306
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,040
one of the most famous examples in elite

1307
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:58,240
private education in the United States.

1308
00:46:53,040 --> 00:47:01,200
Um which is uh um there were um uh

1309
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:05,359
donors to the the Philips exit school

1310
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,079
who were really concerned um that that

1311
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,200
essentially there's too much

1312
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,480
instructionism and not enough

1313
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,839
constructionism. They wouldn't have said

1314
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,040
it the exact same way, but they would

1315
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,040
have said something along those lines.

1316
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,760
Too much sitting passive listening, not

1317
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,400
enough sort of engaged conversation. Um

1318
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,560
and so a a bunch of donors uh got

1319
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,640
together um and they said in every

1320
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,480
classroom we're going to pull out all of

1321
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,599
the chairs that look like this and we're

1322
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,839
going to put in these tables called

1323
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,240
Harkness tables. Um some of the features

1324
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,760
of Harkness tables are that you need to

1325
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,240
be able to fit everybody in the class

1326
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,079
sort of in an oval around the table. Um

1327
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,720
the tables are so large that they

1328
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,240
usually have to be like built in

1329
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,920
different pieces and then shipped into

1330
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,000
the room and then assembled inside the

1331
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,720
room. um they're incredibly heavy, but

1332
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,079
they um they they make it so there is no

1333
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,480
front of the room. Um they they and and

1334
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,079
they, you know, at Philips exit at other

1335
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,880
kinds of independent schools, they put

1336
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,240
these tables in every classroom. Um they

1337
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,280
put them in the English classrooms, they

1338
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,400
put them in the history classrooms, but

1339
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,839
they put them in the math classrooms,

1340
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,079
they put them in the science classrooms.

1341
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:08,720
Um and the intention was to to change

1342
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,319
the physical space in order to create

1343
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,920
certain kinds of learning environments

1344
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,400
and certain kinds of interactions there

1345
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,359
and there. Now, of course, um you can

1346
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,680
give a math lecture in a room like this,

1347
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,359
but it's but it's hard to lecture for 52

1348
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,200
minutes, you know, if you're standing

1349
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,640
here and half the kids either have their

1350
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,240
backs to you or have to, you know,

1351
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,800
rotate around or other kinds of things

1352
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,160
like that. Um it's it's designed to make

1353
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,280
people do that. So you can sort of think

1354
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,960
about like what are the you know h what

1355
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,880
are what you know what uh what agenda

1356
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,760
does this online space have for its

1357
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,960
occupants? Um what is it that a can that

1358
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,720
a sort of generic canvas classroom tells

1359
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,200
instructors and students that they're

1360
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,640
supposed to do?

1361
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,160
Um the you can look at these links

1362
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,240
later, but these are two of the folks

1363
00:48:52,160 --> 00:49:00,559
who um as as as Blackboard was sort of

1364
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,440
sweeping higher education were uh um uh

1365
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,040
amongst the most active in trying to

1366
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,760
have these conversations. There was a

1367
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,720
book um that was written about them uh

1368
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,800
and some other people called Edupunks um

1369
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,119
and uh trying to make connection between

1370
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,280
the the punk movement and music um you

1371
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,960
know very sort of like countercultural

1372
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,760
do-it-yourself

1373
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,319
um you know uh kind of stand up to the

1374
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,800
man sort of thing um and folks like the

1375
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,760
Reverend Jim Groom um and Alan Cogdon

1376
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,119
living you know they have they have

1377
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,720
these monikers because if you were

1378
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,480
participating in social networks you

1379
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,960
create handles for those kinds of things

1380
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,920
but also Reverend Jim Groom was a bit a

1381
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:41,200
profit of such things.

1382
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:44,200
Um so what what these systems really

1383
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:47,440
allow um is a certain kind of

1384
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:50,160
coordination. Um it becomes very very

1385
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,079
easy to say all the faculty are going to

1386
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,359
have a page. Um you're all going to

1387
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,880
create at the same time. It's going to

1388
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,400
be automatically generated for you at

1389
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,760
the beginning of the semester. Even if

1390
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,720
you don't like computers, we're still

1391
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,599
going to be able to make you do it

1392
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,599
because it's not that hard. Um but there

1393
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,160
are a couple of characteristics of it

1394
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,160
that I think are not so good. I've

1395
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,640
talked mostly about the sort of stamped

1396
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,880
piece of it. Um

1397
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,440
uh there's there's a way in which um the

1398
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,440
control of all of the learning artifacts

1399
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,160
is with the institution and not the

1400
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,000
people. Um, so imagine imagine an

1401
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,800
infrastructure for um online learning

1402
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,359
and higher education where you didn't

1403
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,200
put all the stuff on someone else's web

1404
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,480
page, you put it on your own web page.

1405
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,920
Like what if when you went to do

1406
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,920
homework, you went to do writing, you

1407
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,760
went to ask questions, it didn't show up

1408
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,359
on the school's Canvas site, which you

1409
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,200
don't care about, but it was on your

1410
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,559
site in some kind of way. It was in some

1411
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,000
sort of space that you controlled. And

1412
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,680
then the thing that was always craziest

1413
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,920
to me about these sites is that we

1414
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,440
delete them every 18 months. Um, you

1415
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,240
know, it's a it's a strange thing to go

1416
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,640
to students and be like, "Please pour in

1417
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,520
um your best, most thoughtful, most

1418
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,640
interesting words, ideas." Um, oh, and

1419
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,599
by the way, nine months from now,

1420
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,760
they're going to be automatically

1421
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,800
deleted. Um, that's a that's a sort of

1422
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,359
strange feature to me of a of an online

1423
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,880
learning environment. Um,

1424
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,079
uh, so so me and other folks for a while

1425
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,920
were really interested in like, well,

1426
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,839
what would an alternative to this look

1427
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,559
like? um what would be what would be

1428
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,280
something um that was not Blackboard

1429
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,920
that was not Canvas um that still could

1430
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,359
have coordination um but it would let it

1431
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,839
would have some of these characteristics

1432
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,680
that the sort of web 2.0 open web

1433
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:34,079
movement had like it let students own

1434
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,880
their own stuff um it helped them

1435
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,680
develop some technology proficiency. It

1436
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,680
connected people um to each other and to

1437
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,079
their work. It didn't just like hoover

1438
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,520
up your stuff, churn it through, grade

1439
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,880
it, and delete it, but it would be like

1440
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,200
something that you owned and cared about

1441
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,760
for a while. Um,

1442
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,880
uh, those are ice cream sandwiches. Um,

1443
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:58,800
uh, yeah. Good. Yeah. So, it's a good

1444
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,839
it's a good picture. It, you know, it

1445
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,200
definitely evokes some of these kinds of

1446
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,119
pictures. Like some of these kinds of

1447
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,000
pictures sort of ended up on like

1448
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,760
professor Twitter handles in the 2013.

1449
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,400
Um, I didn't make that picture. I had

1450
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,319
one semester um where I don't know some

1451
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,400
students just were like enjoying class

1452
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,920
and they sent me a whole bunch of p I

1453
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,400
don't know how quickly can I find these

1454
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,760
things.

1455
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,760
Um there's one of

1456
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,760
me.

1457
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:40,800
Uh are these going to be on here?

1458
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,800
Um. H there's a few. There's like this

1459
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:50,400
one. This one. Oh, no. That's a real

1460
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:51,920
one. Justin is LeBron James. A little

1461
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,160
little dicey to be doing this one these

1462
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,480
days. I don't You probably wouldn't uh

1463
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,040
you probably wouldn't put white Justin

1464
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,760
into a black body anymore, but uh back

1465
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,440
in the day. Um yeah, I don't for one day

1466
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,640
for class uh I think something terrible

1467
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,240
had happened in the world and I made

1468
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,960
them ice cream sandwiches one day for

1469
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,280
class and so they uh um they made that

1470
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,280
picture there.

1471
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,559
It was for

1472
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:17,960
a we're get we're getting to the real

1473
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,920
issues

1474
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,440
now. I think that I went to the

1475
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,640
International Society and Technology and

1476
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,599
Education conference and they basically

1477
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,599
grabbed a bunch of random people and

1478
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,319
took them to a photo shoot to generate

1479
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,920
their own stock photos. Um they they

1480
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,520
want they wanted to have a whole set of

1481
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,400
stock photos that were from the

1482
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,680
membership of this organization. And so

1483
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,599
it was just like I don't think I was

1484
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,599
holding any I think I I mean I like you

1485
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,800
could imagine this is like generic

1486
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,640
invitation to kind of thing. Um, but

1487
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:55,760
that's where all that came from.

1488
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:59,040
Um, is is this worth your learning time?

1489
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,680
Hard to say, but it's pretty fun. Okay,

1490
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,559
this you should remember a little bit.

1491
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:11,040
Um, this is another this is another

1492
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:12,480
branch of um uh of constructionism. You

1493
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,079
know, these ideas just repeat

1494
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,760
themselves. They get reinvented over and

1495
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,680
over again. um these two Canadian

1496
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,040
educators, people who sort of founded

1497
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:23,200
the 2007208 original mass of open online

1498
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,920
courses and they had this idea called

1499
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,839
connectivism. Um and they said, you

1500
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,760
know, part of the problem with learning

1501
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:34,240
theory is that it thinks that learning

1502
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,480
happens and knowledge exists inside

1503
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,880
people's heads. But learning and

1504
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,280
knowledge really exists between people

1505
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,760
more than exists within people. Um

1506
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,800
there's a famous line which is which you

1507
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,319
probably all would agree with in some

1508
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,119
way that the smartest person in the room

1509
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:51,599
is the room. Um that like the collective

1510
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,960
capacity of people is where kind of the

1511
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,720
heart of art intelligence is like

1512
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,880
connectivism almost went further and

1513
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,960
said like maybe the only intelligence in

1514
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,480
the room is the room. Um maybe your

1515
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,720
knowledge your understanding like

1516
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,000
doesn't exist without social convention

1517
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,240
like language um like culture other

1518
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,319
kinds of things like that. Um so this

1519
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,880
was so this was at first an educational

1520
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,480
philosophy. Um may you know may maybe it

1521
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,160
was a maybe it was an epistemology maybe

1522
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,839
it was a philosophy of knowledge but

1523
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,079
then it got translated into these

1524
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:23,160
pedagogical ideas. Um and the

1525
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:26,000
pedagogical ideas were say what if you

1526
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,480
defined courses where their primary

1527
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,800
value was creating connections between

1528
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,240
people and ideas. Um uh one of one of

1529
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,920
the things Stephen D said about this

1530
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,480
which you'll find it very connected to

1531
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,960
situated learning um he says you know

1532
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,240
like if you become a physicist what

1533
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,559
happens um well like you read physics

1534
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,920
papers and you follow new ideas in

1535
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,920
physics and you figure out where

1536
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,640
physicists talk to each other and like

1537
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,640
where the physics lounge is um and which

1538
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,400
physics conferences to go to I don't

1539
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,760
know what music physicists like what

1540
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,839
television shows they find funny all

1541
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,000
these kinds of things like that is as

1542
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,920
much a part of becoming a physicist as

1543
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,359
learning formulas and theories and

1544
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,040
knowledge and things like that. What if

1545
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,520
we had educational systems that took

1546
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,559
that really seriously? Like the job of a

1547
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,960
physics class is not just to have you,

1548
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,119
you know, be able to learn some formulas

1549
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,599
about Newton's three laws, but to

1550
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:22,319
connect to other physicists. That's kind

1551
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,760
of that's kind of a cool idea. Um, uh,

1552
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,359
Ste, one of the most radical things

1553
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,440
Steven DS ever said, he said something

1554
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:30,880
along the lines of, "In my class, the

1555
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,119
content is McGuffin." Um, a mcguffin is

1556
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,119
the thing in a movie that's not really

1557
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,880
important that drives the plot forward.

1558
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,400
Um, it's the briefcase that gets

1559
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,920
switched in the beginning which helps

1560
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,839
two people fall in love with each other

1561
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,200
or something like that. Um, the mcguffin

1562
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,200
is the thing that you're sort of chasing

1563
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,799
to make the plot move forward. This is a

1564
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,960
radical statement for an educator. The

1565
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:51,119
content is a mcguffin. The thing that I

1566
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,799
told you the class is about as a trick.

1567
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,040
The real part of the class is getting

1568
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,319
you connected to each other, to things

1569
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,240
that you're interested in, to other

1570
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,160
kinds of expertise is a very radical set

1571
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,880
of ideas. Um, and there are a lot of

1572
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,200
people who are sort of um profoundly

1573
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,720
influenced by them. Um, and people

1574
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,440
trying to say like, yeah, well, what

1575
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:14,400
what could some like genuine alternative

1576
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:17,200
architecture to canvas um that embraced

1577
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,359
some of these ideas of the open web, of

1578
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,640
web 2.0, of connectism, what might it

1579
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:24,480
look like? Um, and so this no longer

1580
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,040
exists. I don't I don't think either of

1581
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,440
those links are live anymore. Um, but

1582
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,599
this is what the website for this class,

1583
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:35,280
um, or an earlier version of this class

1584
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:37,680
used to look like. Um, and here's how

1585
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,480
the infrastructure of it worked. Um, at

1586
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,040
the beginning of class, um, folks were

1587
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,520
assigned to create spaces where they

1588
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,799
would do the work of this class. Um, so

1589
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,119
you wouldn't have a learning journal.

1590
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:50,960
You wouldn't have like a Canvas

1591
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,960
discussion page or something like that.

1592
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,720
Go make your own blog. Go make your own

1593
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,799
Tumblr page. Go make your own Twitter

1594
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,040
feed. Go make your own Flickr page. Make

1595
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:02,799
all kinds of other things like that. Um,

1596
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,880
and do all of the work for this class in

1597
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,880
your own space. Now, one problem with

1598
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,640
that is that nobody can find that stuff

1599
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,000
anymore. Now, it's all sort of on other

1600
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,000
people's things. But that's a solvable

1601
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,440
problem. Um, because we're going to

1602
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,480
build this thing called the syndication

1603
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,960
bus. Um and the syndication bus is gonna

1604
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,160
depend on this technology which how many

1605
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,760
of you are familiar with real simple

1606
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,520
syndication. Is that something that you

1607
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,799
like you like vaguely know exists? So

1608
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,880
again 10 or 15 years ago um this was

1609
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,480
considered like an essential part of the

1610
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,000
web and there are many people would have

1611
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,480
told you like this is the future of of

1612
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,359
how people will find things. So before

1613
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,440
um you know Jiren was telling us before

1614
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,280
about the YouTube algorithm kind of

1615
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,559
controlling what he watches and what he

1616
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,880
finds and things like that. An

1617
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,440
alternative to that was you subscribe to

1618
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,040
a series of feeds. Um so you would like

1619
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,240
find all the bloggers that you like or

1620
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,000
all the video bloggers you like or

1621
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,839
whatever else. You would choose their

1622
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,440
feeds and then you would have you know

1623
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,920
one really popular technology was called

1624
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,920
Google Reader which just gave you the

1625
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,799
things that came out of those feeds. So

1626
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,799
instead of instead of being sort of like

1627
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,160
bounced around by an algorithm to things

1628
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,079
that people think are popular,

1629
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,599
interesting and things like that um you

1630
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,799
sort of have more control over that. So

1631
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,960
basically what we did um was everyone

1632
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,960
would create their own online space and

1633
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,480
then we would use this signification bus

1634
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:25,359
to aggregate all those things. So

1635
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:27,280
effectively um we would oh there

1636
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,760
um there's an animation there that's

1637
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,520
missing. Um, we would make a copy of

1638
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,079
each of these pieces and we would pull

1639
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,000
the copy into the syndication bus. So,

1640
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,160
you owned your own thing, but we would

1641
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,960
use RSS to grab one copy of those

1642
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:44,880
things. Um, and then we would aggregate

1643
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,200
them in different kinds of ways. Um, so,

1644
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,720
um, imagine if every time you wrote in

1645
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,040
your learning journal, you didn't just

1646
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,920
write in your own Google Slides, um, but

1647
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,680
you wrote on a blog, um, anybody could

1648
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,000
subscribe to that blog, but the course

1649
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,559
subscribed to the blog. um and sort of

1650
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,960
hoovered all of those things up into one

1651
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:07,040
space. Um you could also um teach people

1652
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,280
other ways of aggregating things like

1653
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,359
anytime in any of the spaces that you're

1654
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,000
working you share something that we

1655
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,799
might be interested tag it with T509

1656
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,640
massive. Um and then what gets populated

1657
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,839
in this sort of syndication bust Twitter

1658
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,599
channel is like all the tweets that

1659
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:25,000
people have that are about T509 massive.

1660
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:29,160
Um there were

1661
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:32,559
uh the then um when you showed up on the

1662
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,079
homepage I as the instructor would pick

1663
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,920
a few of these things. So there was a

1664
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,040
section called the spotlight where I

1665
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,480
would sort of go through all the stuff

1666
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,079
that people were generating every week

1667
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,520
and pick a few things that I thought

1668
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,640
were like particularly interesting,

1669
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,559
particularly important, particularly

1670
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,400
funny, stuff like that, and sort of show

1671
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:50,720
them to people to feature them.

1672
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:53,359
Um and then uh that's probably kind of

1673
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,280
less important. Um, but then there were

1674
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,640
other spaces, you know, we I could

1675
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,319
create spaces that were about a

1676
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,720
particular assignment. Um, you could

1677
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,920
say, "Okay, everybody is working on your

1678
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,960
Oh, oh, I want to tell you about how I

1679
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,200
graded the class, but I could say,

1680
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,280
"Everybody create your rubric." Um, and

1681
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,960
then pull all of those things together,

1682
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,160
you know, like have a kind of rubric hub

1683
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,599
that everybody could see those things.

1684
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,880
And then we had a space, I think it was

1685
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,440
called the fire hose or something like

1686
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,400
that. Um, where it was everything that

1687
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,920
was coming in. Um there were probably 50

1688
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,599
or 60 people who took this version of

1689
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,119
the class and so there was no way that

1690
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,200
everybody was going to read everything

1691
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:28,799
that everyone else did but like a part

1692
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,040
of class every week was finding out um

1693
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,720
who are you connected with who are you

1694
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,799
finding interesting who are you learning

1695
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,400
from like oh you four were English

1696
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,760
teachers before you came in like this

1697
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,760
class like you should beworked with each

1698
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,599
other moreover you should beworked to

1699
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,960
other English teachers um the things

1700
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,960
that you're generating like if you're

1701
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,119
putting a bunch of work into this class

1702
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,640
why just have it sit in a, you know, in

1703
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,160
a discussion form that no one's ever

1704
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,359
going to see again, like put it in this

1705
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,160
space where you can share with other

1706
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:56,839
people and stuff like that. Um,

1707
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,359
uh,

1708
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:03,760
one, you know, if you if you if you if

1709
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:06,640
you take this idea, um, of letting

1710
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,480
people choose how they want to share who

1711
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,839
they want to connect with sort of

1712
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,760
seriously, the more and more you get to

1713
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,920
this idea of like there, you know,

1714
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,200
there's no right way to do this. Um,

1715
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,040
you're all coming into this class with

1716
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,640
different goals. Maybe some of you, you

1717
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,960
know, really want to connect with other

1718
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,240
edtech companies and are interested in

1719
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,599
being a founder or working for a

1720
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,200
startup. Maybe some of you want to go

1721
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,799
into education research. Maybe some want

1722
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,400
to go into teaching. Why should you all

1723
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,760
have the same criteria for what you're

1724
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,760
writing about or what you're sharing?

1725
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,040
Why don't you just tell me what it is

1726
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,880
that you want to learn about? Why don't

1727
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,839
you tell me what your goals are for this

1728
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,640
kind of communication? Um and so people

1729
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:42,559
would create uh their own rubrics about

1730
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,760
um you know essentially like you tell me

1731
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,119
what your blog is supposed to do

1732
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,040
supposed to accomplish. I think at one

1733
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,720
point um you know there was a part of

1734
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,480
the assignment which you had to say like

1735
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,160
describe how your writing is going to

1736
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,520
benefit you and your learning, how your

1737
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,040
writing is going to benefit the other

1738
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,720
people in this class and how your

1739
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,079
writing might plausibly benefit some

1740
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,760
other community somewhere else that

1741
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,040
you're connected to in some kind of way.

1742
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,000
This was a professional I taught this at

1743
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,520
the Harvard Graduate School of

1744
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,799
Education. So people were sort of for

1745
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,480
the most part already coming in with

1746
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:09,799
with some kind of professional

1747
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,319
communities from outside to to network.

1748
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:15,839
Um and

1749
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:18,720
um and there were there were lots of

1750
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:20,559
other people um who were doing this kind

1751
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,559
of thing. Um this was a course called

1752
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,640
connected courses which was basically

1753
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,480
teaching people across higher education

1754
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,880
how you would go about creating these

1755
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,400
courses. Um, but people built them in

1756
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,920
anthropology. You know, probably one of

1757
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,920
the most famous ones, which I think

1758
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,160
still has a bunch of stuff which exists,

1759
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,960
um, is called DS 106, digital

1760
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,960
storytelling 106, um, which was a course

1761
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,319
offered, um, at the University of Mary

1762
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,839
Washington, but like essentially

1763
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,440
syndicated to a bunch of other

1764
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,960
universities and also built in such a

1765
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,960
way I still, you can probably still go

1766
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:53,119
to ds 106.org right now. Um, and uh, it

1767
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,680
was mostly about creative assignments.

1768
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,599
Um, they had a uh they had a feature

1769
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,119
called the daily create where you know

1770
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,319
some if you took this class four days a

1771
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,920
week, you were supposed to do a daily

1772
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:04,400
create. It might be something like my

1773
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,720
favorite one was uh um pull out your

1774
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,200
keychain and make a short video where

1775
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,880
you tell the story of your keychain. Um

1776
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,559
where does each key come from? What does

1777
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,000
it mean to you? Other kinds of things

1778
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:18,599
like that. Um sort of figuring out how

1779
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,119
to make their way across the web.

1780
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:23,760
Um so I told you this was a story

1781
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,520
essentially of a failed enterprise. Um

1782
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,520
you won't f like clearly I'm not

1783
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,520
teaching like this anymore. Um you won't

1784
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,839
find many other classes. You'll find

1785
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,000
you'll find you know the ideas kind of

1786
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:37,520
out there percolating in different

1787
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,760
spaces. Um uh but like probably doesn't

1788
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,760
really exist. Um why did it fail?

1789
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,839
Probably two big reasons. Um one that

1790
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,440
we'll keep coming back to which I've

1791
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:48,400
termed the curse of the familiar which

1792
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,319
is it's just weird. Um, it's different.

1793
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,240
It's unusual. It takes a bunch of time

1794
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,280
to learn. On the one hand, I think

1795
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,359
people who are participating in these

1796
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,960
classes were like, "Ah man, I learned a

1797
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,319
lot of stuff about blogging, about using

1798
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,079
Twitter, about connecting with other

1799
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:02,240
people, about social networking." But

1800
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,760
like, you know, my guy the, you know,

1801
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,200
the the class was intermediate

1802
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,559
statistics. Like like that's not what

1803
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,599
you were supposed to be learning in this

1804
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,960
thing. Um there were a handful of

1805
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:12,720
universities that built a sort of

1806
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,440
collaborative infrastructure around this

1807
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,440
stuff in the hopes that you could drive

1808
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,599
down some of the complexity. So this guy

1809
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,079
Jim Groom built a company called Reclaim

1810
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:24,720
Hosting um which tried to make it really

1811
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,559
like universities could sign up to make

1812
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,240
it really easy for every student in the

1813
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,520
school to start a blog and then you like

1814
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,720
teach them all about blogging a little

1815
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,160
bit and then maybe you could get away

1816
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,680
from discussion forums and have people

1817
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,400
do more so of their short form writing

1818
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,240
on blogs. Um maybe there are some people

1819
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,599
out there that are still trying it but

1820
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:46,160
uh but not that much. Um and then

1821
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:48,880
um uh another huge challenge with asking

1822
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,640
people to write publicly uh is that we

1823
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:54,799
are not all equally vulnerable to the

1824
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:57,760
consequences of um having our writing be

1825
01:05:54,799 --> 01:06:00,880
read. Anybody recognize this person? Um

1826
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,119
she's a woman named uh Anita Sarassian

1827
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,799
um who uh um had a website called

1828
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:09,760
Feminist Frequency which uh um was sort

1829
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:13,039
of one of one of the initial spaces that

1830
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,760
was related to um what became Gamergate.

1831
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,839
Um she uh she made a bunch of videos

1832
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:22,799
basically about sort of anti-feminist

1833
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:24,720
themes in video games like how uh um how

1834
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:26,160
like you know there's always a princess

1835
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,520
that needs to be saved and the princess

1836
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,119
doesn't actually have to like doesn't

1837
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,760
get to have her own character and things

1838
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:36,960
like that. Um and uh just you know piled

1839
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,640
on ruthlessly um by by all kinds of

1840
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,640
people you know especially people who

1841
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,520
who saw gaming as a hobby who didn't

1842
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:46,079
want these tropes changed. Um, and so

1843
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,359
you know, people get doxed and swatted

1844
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,599
and all kinds of Are you all familiar

1845
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:51,359
with Gamergate? Is that a phrase? Okay.

1846
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,160
Um, so I don't even remember what year

1847
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:55,440
this was now, but uh um I don't know. We

1848
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,400
should in the media studies department,

1849
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,200
we should be teaching a class called

1850
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,920
Gamergate. It was it was kind of um it

1851
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:06,520
seemed ludicrous at the time, but it was

1852
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:09,359
uh it was a sort of way of you know

1853
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:11,760
organizing groups of people to

1854
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:14,559
effectively suppress communication from

1855
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,680
sort of subalter perspectives from

1856
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,839
people who are trying to say different

1857
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,520
kinds of things. Um, so yeah, anyway,

1858
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,760
for me as like a pretty privileged white

1859
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,920
dude like blogging my way through the

1860
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,280
world is relatively safe and relatively

1861
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,119
straightforward, but you know, if I have

1862
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,160
50 or 60 students in my class, they're

1863
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,359
all going to be coming from different

1864
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,079
perspectives and they're all going to be

1865
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,599
sort of inequitably vulnerable um to

1866
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,400
writing something which catches the

1867
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:39,200
attention in negative ways of big crowds

1868
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,400
um or offends people or messes up their

1869
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,079
relationship or other kinds of things. I

1870
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,559
mean, what part of what you want to do

1871
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,480
in writing in a class is let people be

1872
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,839
experimental and try on ideas that they

1873
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,839
don't agree with yet or don't understand

1874
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:56,000
yet, you know, and in when I was doing

1875
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:58,480
this in 2013, that felt like a little

1876
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,680
bit risky, maybe like yeah, I could I

1877
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,520
could imagine someone might like take

1878
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:03,359
down a post that they, you know, decide

1879
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,559
wasn't well worded or disagree with

1880
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:09,920
things like that. Um, in 2024, it seems

1881
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:12,880
substantially um more risky. Not not I

1882
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:16,080
would say not just because um of

1883
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,440
heightened sensitivities um but because

1884
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:21,319
you know because actors in society have

1885
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:24,719
learned how to

1886
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:26,960
um how to how to broadcast messages that

1887
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:29,520
appear online in various kinds of places

1888
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,759
um and to use them to generate outrage

1889
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,239
and drive traffic and and those kinds of

1890
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:35,759
things.

1891
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:39,279
Um, oh, this was the company, uh,

1892
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,359
Reclaim Hosting. Um, and they're, uh,

1893
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:44,159
somebody should Google Reclaim Hosting

1894
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,640
and see if they're they're still, um,

1895
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:48,080
uh, known for education was a was a

1896
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,679
project that was basically it was sort

1897
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,560
of trying to take like everything that I

1898
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,480
just described and figure out like how

1899
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,920
do you make a really simple front end

1900
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,520
for it so it's not hard for people to

1901
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,920
build, but it still lets people own

1902
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,239
stuff. um it still lets people sort of

1903
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,600
you know be the be the owner of their

1904
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:09,279
own means of production.

1905
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,560
Um but it's something that I think will

1906
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:17,120
um this was you know by far the most

1907
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:20,159
exciting part of teaching these courses

1908
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,920
was realizing that people were still

1909
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,920
using this infrastructure in various

1910
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,759
kinds of ways years after the course

1911
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,199
ended. So I think I taught this course

1912
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,279
in 2013 and still in 2015 people were

1913
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,319
posting on their blogs connecting with

1914
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,400
each other like you know I don't know

1915
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,640
the equivalent of that would be like you

1916
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,640
know if you're in 1806 now and it has a

1917
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,400
piaza forum what if three years from now

1918
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,239
you were inspired to like hop back in

1919
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,080
there and

1920
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:46,000
still like good god I would never do

1921
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,679
such a thing but part you know you

1922
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,199
wouldn't do such a thing because you

1923
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,239
don't own it and it's not yours and you

1924
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,440
can't take it in the direction that

1925
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:52,719
you're interested in. But if we, you

1926
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,719
know, in higher education, if we gave

1927
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,960
you an infrastructure that you had some

1928
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,800
control over, um, you might be

1929
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,600
substantially more, I mean, at least the

1930
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,960
students at the time were, um, were were

1931
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,880
interested in in continuing to pursue

1932
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,440
these kinds of, uh, these kinds of

1933
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,120
learning experiences.

1934
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:14,880
Um but I would but I would say the sort

1935
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:17,120
of the the the degree to which people

1936
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,679
feel much more individual threat about

1937
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:22,880
sharing things um online especially in

1938
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:25,280
really sort of open spaces. Um and just

1939
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,199
the like difficulty of the ramp up time

1940
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,560
of building all this infrastructure has

1941
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,400
made it like more or less um an

1942
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,480
interesting dead end and something kind

1943
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:37,440
of fun to learn from and explore. It

1944
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,520
probably also illustrates um more of

1945
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,000
what you'll read about. This is like an

1946
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,480
effort in higher education that

1947
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,480
basically foundered. Um you'll read

1948
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,440
about other kinds of things that sort of

1949
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,199
foundered in different ways in K12 or

1950
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,760
the challenge to make them not founder

1951
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:56,880
for next week. Like there's all this

1952
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,360
amazing learning that happens um in

1953
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,640
people's informal learning experiences.

1954
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:04,239
How do we why is it so hard to bring

1955
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,840
those practices into school

1956
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,239
environments? What is the nature of

1957
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:11,000
school environments um that makes it

1958
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:13,600
difficult for that to happen?

1959
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,880
Um good. What qu maybe I think that's

1960
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,760
where I got to the end. what questions

1961
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:21,360
do folks have or what um um my question

1962
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,800
is um what place kind of does um like

1963
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:27,440
kind of online community building

1964
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:29,840
without the presence of like instructors

1965
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:34,520
have in this

1966
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:37,520
yeah if it was if if this worked

1967
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,520
um because you owned your own piece of

1968
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,840
writing you know I'm teaching this class

1969
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,760
at a professional school um you might

1970
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,360
find that actually what motivates you

1971
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:49,840
most to write these assignments is that

1972
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,920
you've found a bunch of other sixth

1973
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,760
grade science teachers that are reading

1974
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,280
your blog posts and you sort of

1975
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:59,520
increasingly care less that you know

1976
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,000
Justin the instructor of this class is

1977
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,440
reading your stuff and more like hey I'm

1978
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,440
getting my ideas out there and

1979
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,159
connecting more with other earth science

1980
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,480
teachers. Um and that I think for a lot

1981
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:13,840
of you know when it was most successful

1982
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:16,640
that for people just felt like work that

1983
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,640
was super real and urgent. Um you know

1984
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,560
the the other thing is most of the thing

1985
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:24,560
I don't know um when people got

1986
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,719
responses it it there there wasn't a

1987
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,719
whole lot of there's probably some but

1988
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:32,159
there wasn't a whole lot of like you are

1989
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:34,480
required to reply to at least two people

1990
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:37,360
um kinds of things. Um there was a lot

1991
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,880
of you know when like people would write

1992
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,640
blog posts but they would write blog

1993
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,239
posts that sort of tagged or or posted

1994
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,800
back to someone else's post. So it was

1995
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,040
just kind of like a natural um uh

1996
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,800
conversation that was that was happening

1997
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,320
and unfolding like where it was most

1998
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,480
successful

1999
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,960
um what you felt like as an instructor

2000
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:59,520
is you were you were just like put

2001
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,199
putting putting some fuel for this fire

2002
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,640
to burn on its own. you were just like,

2003
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,080
you know, here check out these things

2004
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,440
like, you know, and then but then people

2005
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,640
would take them in the directions that

2006
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,520
they were most interested and excited

2007
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,520
about. Does that answer your

2008
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:15,679
question other thoughts or things that

2009
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:21,120
how does this play into the Google doc

2010
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:24,000
that runs this course? Huh? Yeah. So,

2011
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,880
well, some of it is I uh probably

2012
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,560
probably the main lingering piece um is

2013
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,560
that it's a is that it's a pain in the

2014
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,280
ass to show my Canvas site to someone

2015
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,920
else. And one of the main things that I

2016
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,920
want to do is, you know, I don't know,

2017
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,600
in in in my career of teaching is be

2018
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,000
able to like quickly to explain to other

2019
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,440
people how I teach. Um, so one, you

2020
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,199
know, one of the best things about

2021
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,360
having the whole course live on a Google

2022
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:49,280
doc is, you know, any new professor

2023
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,400
who's just starting teaching edtech and

2024
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,920
society, it's like here's a whole

2025
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,880
course, you know, take it and c I mean,

2026
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,280
they're probably taking it and like

2027
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,120
shoving it bit by bit into Canvas, which

2028
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,840
I've done periodically for some things.

2029
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:02,159
Um, that any of you, you know, who want

2030
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,360
to sign up for my, you know, future

2031
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,640
people who are interested in this class,

2032
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,920
you know, syllabus is there. You, you

2033
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,280
know, I mean, it's even got it's even

2034
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,640
got the revision history. You can now

2035
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,640
see, nobody does that, but you can now

2036
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,560
see what we did. I mean in I I would

2037
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,320
also say earlier versions of that like

2038
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,280
when the web was sort of more active in

2039
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,199
this way, you know, I would like over

2040
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,239
the summer I would post like here are

2041
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:22,320
all the changes that I made to my

2042
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:23,840
syllabus and like circulated around to

2043
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,520
hashtags or other networks of people

2044
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,600
that were active in those conversations

2045
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,760
and people would definitely jump in to

2046
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,360
the syllabus um and through and add

2047
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,480
comments and be like oh you this new

2048
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,600
book just came out or these new

2049
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,000
resources came out and things like that.

2050
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,760
I mean it existed as a for for a period

2051
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,199
of time a much more sort of social

2052
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,040
document. Um again when when yeah there

2053
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,480
were a lot of you know educators

2054
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,400
especially people interested in online

2055
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,000
learning and education technology who

2056
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,239
were pretty active in those kinds of

2057
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
communities. Um and so you could do

2058
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,800
stuff like that. Now it's mostly just a

2059
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,199
legacy of you know editing that thing is

2060
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,239
so much easier than editing canvas. Um

2061
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,840
anytime I want to change something in

2062
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,840
canvas I have to do it in three places

2063
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,640
and click 15 buttons like Google doc I

2064
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,640
just edit. Um good. So that was a little

2065
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,159
bit in uh some of these ideas of peer

2066
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,800
guided learning in higher education.

2067
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:12,000
We'll see some more of them. Um, in K12,

2068
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,520
I think you're going to read some stuff

2069
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,960
from Mimito and uh

2070
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:22,880
um what else did I make you do for next

2071
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,520
time? And and Mitch Resnik um about

2072
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:28,480
Scratch, which is Scratch is probably

2073
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,000
the um most successful peer-guided

2074
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,840
learning environment which has made its

2075
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,440
way into K12 schools. Although one of

2076
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,080
the things that we'll learn is that uh

2077
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,320
when it gets there it kind of gets uh

2078
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,640
schoolified in ways that are horrific to

2079
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,560
the people who made it. But uh more to

2080
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:45,040
follow when they discuss that uh on

2081
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,560
Monday. Great. Have a wonderful uh rest

2082
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,960
of your week and weekend and I will see

2083
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,960
you next week.
