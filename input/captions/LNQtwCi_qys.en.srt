00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,200
Welcome everyone. Thank you for joining

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,599
us for our open conversation with

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,800
neurossychologist and lifelong learner

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,359
Beia Adams. Today we'll talk about the

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
ways in which curiosity and continuous

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,480
learning can transform personal growth

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,359
and mental well-being.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,239
I'm Curt Newton, director of O MIT Open

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,000
Courseware. Open Courseware is a free

10
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
and open collection of materials from

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,280
thousands of MIT courses covering the

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,040
entire MIT curriculum. We create new

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,680
opportunities for millions of learners

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,120
and educators, share open education

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,440
resources from MIT, and help lead a glo

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,280
global revolution in free access to

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,440
knowledge.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,239
This is the third event in the open

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,559
conversation series which focuses on how

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,719
open learning can empower people to

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,080
improve their lives, communities, and

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,200
the world. Our guest today is Beia

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,680
Adams. Beia has been on a fascinating

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
and inspiring journey from an initial

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,159
degree and work in clinical and

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,320
behavioral psychology to dance with the

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,040
London Contemporary Dance School and the

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,640
Royal Ballet and then back to psychology

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,080
extending into computational

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,400
neuroscience and related fields with MIT

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,720
open learning resources.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Thank you, Beia, for joining us today.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,240
There's so much to get to explore and

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,280
share. Really looking forward to it. So

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,360
if we might begin um you know with your

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,560
wonderful accomplishments

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,479
academic and in personal pursuits

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
beia what would you please share with us

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,880
some of the themes and through lines in

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
your career and your personal growth and

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,640
how curiosity

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,439
has played a role in this journey.

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,920
>> Hi Kurt. Hi everyone. Um thank you for

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,880
having me. I'm so excited to finally be

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,680
here. Um yeah, a few things about

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,680
myself. Uh I'm a neurosychologist as you

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,080
said and I'm a former professional

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,840
dancer. Um I um I'm also a lifelong

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
learning. My career has been built

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,440
across diverse experiences, but I think

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,720
I've always retained an interest in

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,200
lifelong learning. Um I like to say that

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,599
if money and jobs were not concepts, I

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,680
would happily be a forever student. Um I

55
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,680
um started dancing when I was four, four

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
and a half. What I thought, my mom

57
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,440
thought would be just a few lessons of

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,480
of ballet turned into many years of

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,720
dancing. Um

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,120
I've spent most of my childhood and

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,200
teens dancing. Then I I've studied

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,480
psychology, clinical and and and

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,800
cognitive. I worked as a psychologist uh

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,480
for a few years. Then in my mid20ies I

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,239
um I I went on an extended sabbatical

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,000
because I wanted to explore dance um a

67
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,120
bit more and I wanted to perform a bit

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,720
more. So I um this time I studied

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
contemporary dance in London

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,959
contemporary dance school and I I

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,599
performed for a few years. I also

72
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,599
explored with other movement practices.

73
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:23,120
Um I managed to get a back a black belt

74
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:27,120
in Iikido. I started skateboarding,

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,159
longboarding which of course led to to

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,720
quite a few injuries and due to those

77
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,280
and also because I I'd really developed

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,400
an interest in the neuroscience part of

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,280
psychology. I went back to psychology

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
and I I resumed my studies and I

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
eventually specialized in medical

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,879
neuroscience and started working as a

83
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,280
psych as a neurosychologist which is

84
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,840
what I do uh now. Um I still dance

85
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,920
albeit not professionally but I do it

86
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:02,159
regularly and uh which with much joy. Um

87
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:06,319
I I discovered MIT um open courses in

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:10,799
2022 it was. Yes. And I completed um

89
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:14,159
several from from various fields. Um and

90
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,639
I'm planning to actually approach um

91
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:21,759
more uh in next year. Um I other than

92
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,080
that I'm I'm multilingual. I grew up

93
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,759
speaking several languages and then

94
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,320
acquired more. Uh my one of my project I

95
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,639
mean every five years I try to approach

96
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,720
a new language and I'm I'm doing that at

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,440
the moment. Um I find much um I'm I'm

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,560
drawn I'm curious about uh how new

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,320
languages work and how structure arises

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,639
out of them. Um, also this year I I

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,360
finished writing my first book of

102
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,040
fiction uh to be released next year.

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,199
It's called Humans After All and if you

104
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,280
if you watch my online spaces, you will

105
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,080
see excerpts from it already and

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,759
hopefully the final result next year.

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,000
Um,

108
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,440
yeah, you asked me about curiosity. I

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,800
think I think curiosity has been has

110
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,680
been there throughout my uh development.

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,680
Um I was um I've always been drawn by

112
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,919
movement and interested in movement, how

113
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,000
it arises, how our bodies move, why we

114
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,919
are able to do things and why we are not

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,600
able to do things. So I think when I

116
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,400
started doing uh doing ballet I was

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,440
drawn curiosity helped me dissect

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,360
movement uh understand technique

119
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,160
understand timing uh how movement

120
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,840
relates to music. Um another big

121
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,680
interest of mine um then also the the um

122
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
expression the possibilities of

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,039
expression that arise out of tney right

124
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,840
not just the series of steps. So what I

125
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,440
what I didn't know then but I appreciate

126
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,080
now um as a psychologist is that this

127
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,160
curiosity I had activated um the

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,639
dopamineergic system in the brain the

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,440
reward system that's something which

130
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,680
makes you you know go after after

131
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,280
things. It opens the door to learning

132
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,720
and it also makes you a bit more

133
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,360
cognitively flexible so that you can you

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
know adapt to learning and through you

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,880
know the connections that the

136
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,560
dopamineergic system has with the hypoc

137
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,800
campus to consolidate what you've

138
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,600
learned. So I didn't know then that um I

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,840
was actually priming my brain for deep

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,520
learning without even knowing what deep

141
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,960
learning was. Um later on when I

142
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,720
transitioned to uh to neuroscience, I

143
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,720
think

144
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
curiosity

145
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,520
curiosity served almost a protective

146
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,560
almost had a protective role

147
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,840
>> because instead of interpreting this

148
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:09,120
change as um a change in career in you

149
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,280
know almost in identity, I I looked at

150
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,039
the I looked at it as an opportunity to

151
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,319
explore something new, explore something

152
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,120
meaningful. Um, right. Um, and I think

153
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,720
that's important in in periods when uh

154
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,440
you know that we associate with

155
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,199
identity. U I was a dancer and then I

156
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,599
became a scientist. So um instead of

157
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,360
interpreting this this change as a

158
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,759
threat, I tried to look at it um through

159
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,639
the eyes of the explorer. What what

160
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,360
could come out of this? And I think um

161
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,360
that reframes uncertainty and it

162
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,360
refrains ambiguity which our brains are

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,360
not very good at uh to at tolerating. Um

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,759
that's that answer your question.

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,639
>> Yeah. Yeah. That uh that uh spirit of

166
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,000
exploration you know is so fundamental

167
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,400
to you know to what we can get up to and

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,160
uh it's I know thank you for sharing you

169
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:12,080
know that that sort of path. Yeah. Um I

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,840
mean I I would um I would share that you

171
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,400
know what we've learned about the people

172
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,960
who use open MIT open courseware more

173
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,840
broadly from around the world. You know

174
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,080
they're coming from a lot of different

175
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,400
you know positions. You know some of

176
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,639
them are enrolled students. Some of them

177
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,680
are educators trying to figure out how

178
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,440
to teach more effectively.

179
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Many of them are just curious

180
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,399
independent learners. And what we've

181
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,240
heard, you know, from everyone kind of

182
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,800
across the board that the number one

183
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,880
reason why they're coming to these

184
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
resources because they have this

185
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
fundamental curiosity. It's, you know,

186
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,279
and there's often, you know, you know,

187
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,800
other other reasons beyond that. But

188
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,480
it's just really interesting that that

189
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,880
that force is out there so widely

190
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
reflected and uh and you've you've

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,680
definitely been living it. So, thank

192
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,160
you. Yeah.

193
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,360
Um well curiosity if we look at the way

194
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,000
curiosity arises in the brain um I think

195
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,160
that will probably you know just answer

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,360
your your curiosity and your question a

197
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,720
bit more. Um we become more curious when

198
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,040
our brains detect an information gap

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
right when we when we sense that there's

200
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
something we don't know but we could

201
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,040
know that there's something we don't

202
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,600
fully understand but we could

203
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,519
understand. And when the brain detects

204
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,480
this gap, it sets in motion the same uh

205
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:41,360
dopamineergic um system I mentioned

206
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,160
earlier u that in its in turn sets you

207
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,279
know prepares the neurochemical mill the

208
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,680
dopamine required to create the

209
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,920
motivation to go out there seek the

210
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,000
missing information and close the gap

211
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,640
and it's it it's exactly this

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,800
exploratory behavior that we uh

213
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,440
mentioned earlier. So most I I'm

214
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,360
I'm quite confident that a lot of uh uh

215
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
a lot of a lot of learners already have

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
some knowledge from certain fields but

217
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
there is that information gap there's

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,760
that that's something they wish they

219
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,720
would know more of and more from and um

220
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,519
that once they find the platform once

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,440
they find the source of knowledge they

222
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,200
just you know they seize it because

223
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
that's what the brain does right they

224
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,680
have the all the support the neurob

225
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,120
biological support to do that.

226
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,680
>> Yeah. And and it never stops, right? You

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,240
know, those those questions, that sense

228
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,640
of, oh, here's a here's a gap. Here's a

229
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,360
new thing. We we certainly feel that

230
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,560
when we're young all the time, but but

231
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,040
it also it it never stops, right? And so

232
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,000
to be able to support people at every

233
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,200
age of life continuing to explore that

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,480
stuff um as you've been doing uh feels

235
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,240
just really really important and uh uh

236
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,640
useful. Yeah,

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,600
>> it's self-relenishing I would say.

238
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,600
>> Uh like it's it never stops. Uh once you

239
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,760
you answer you know you find an answer

240
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,680
to one question that another one arises.

241
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,600
So, um I I totally agree. Uh and that's

242
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,160
actually an important thing to note.

243
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,160
Curiosity and motivation, they're not um

244
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,560
they're not personality traits. You're

245
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,880
not born of them and they stay rigid for

246
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,839
the rest of their life. They are they

247
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,399
are they are practice. They are tools

248
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,720
and facets of one's behavior that need

249
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
constant practice. And the more you

250
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,160
practice, the more will come out of

251
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,880
them. So, yeah, I agree.

252
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,600
>> Yeah. Yeah.

253
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,399
I wonder um if you if you have a

254
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,079
perspective on how living a life of of

255
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,680
curiosity

256
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
um

257
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,760
supports one's just sort of broader

258
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,160
sense of well-being and and connection

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,880
in the world, you know, through your own

260
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,160
your own experience or you know the the

261
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,680
work that you're doing with other

262
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,680
people. What have what have you seen

263
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,720
about that?

264
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, curiosity per se, the act of you

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,920
know engaging curiosity and motivation

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,880
to engage in new pursuits and mind you

267
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,560
when I say learning curiosity to learn

268
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,079
something new and the motivation to

269
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
learn something new I don't mean just

270
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,880
abstract stuff actually it's preferred

271
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
from a neuroscient

272
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,839
uh for it to be multimodal right

273
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,800
cognitive motor social emotional because

274
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,200
it recruits more areas of the brain

275
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,920
uh going by the same principle of of

276
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,560
lose it or use it or use it or lose it.

277
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,920
>> Um so

278
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,800
maintaining a curious approach uh to

279
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,600
life, maintaining curiosity

280
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,120
um in and engaging with new learning

281
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,560
material with with lifelong learning um

282
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,519
has quite a few benefits and it why why

283
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,000
mainly why it is important? Um, it's

284
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,120
because it literally changes the brain.

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,920
It drives what we call neuroplasticity.

286
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,800
Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability

287
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,920
to change itself in response to

288
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,959
experience, in response to new learning.

289
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:22,480
So, um, curiosity, applied curiosity,

290
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,600
um, and new learning rewires the brain.

291
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,560
You form new new circuits. um you allow

292
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,959
for neurogenesis, the formation of u the

293
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,920
genesis of new neurons in some areas of

294
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,519
the brain, particularly the hippocampus.

295
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,760
It also acts as a protective buffer

296
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,680
against uh age related cognitive

297
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,560
decline. It slows down uh it slows the u

298
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,399
lowers the incidence of dementia.

299
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
Let us not forget the social benefits

300
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,839
that come with, you know, being curious

301
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,199
and engaging in in new pursuits with

302
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,000
others. Just the act of of of doing

303
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,240
something with others, of proving

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,880
oneself to be capable of being

305
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,160
competent, the feeling of self-efficacy

306
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,000
of of of mastery. they build confidence

307
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,480
and all these um all these things um are

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,720
proven to reduce symptoms of anxiety and

309
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:24,959
depression and isolation. Um also um you

310
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:29,199
know the um when you see a curiosity

311
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:33,600
um neuroscience shows us that um when

312
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:37,519
curiosity is high yeah our brains switch

313
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:41,360
from um networks that preferentially

314
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,160
process threat to networks u that allow

315
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,480
for exploration for the for you know for

316
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,680
curious approach for going out in

317
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,680
exploring one's territory that also goes

318
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,920
hand inhand with um let's call it

319
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,480
cognitive flexibility with the ability

320
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,360
to reappraise a situation not in terms

321
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,600
of threat but in terms of exploration so

322
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,760
maintaining this mindset of what else

323
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,399
you know how how else could I look at a

324
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,480
situation what else is there to find out

325
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,480
about this um um how can I look at this

326
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
from a different perspective perspective

327
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,880
like or then you know what else is there

328
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,440
that I you know I feel I could know but

329
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't I don't yet understand but I

330
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,959
know I could the missing puzzle puzzle

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,480
how do I find it the brain loves puzzles

332
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,880
um

333
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,480
that that sense of of curiosity

334
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,639
um

335
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,880
it helps us like we said like I said

336
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,639
before reframe uncertainty but it also

337
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,160
um

338
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,120
you know it It also puts puts us in a in

339
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,120
a in a situation where we also become,

340
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,680
you know, more more resilient.

341
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:01,440
>> Uh we um we allow for for the brains

342
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:05,519
instances of of cognitive reappraisal

343
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:09,360
and um um

344
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,160
reframing of a situation to work so that

345
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,079
we have a better stress response, right?

346
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,880
we u more a less better decision making.

347
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,279
Um the impact of stress on emotional

348
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,040
circuits in the lyic system is is is

349
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,880
reduced. So um curiosity is not just you

350
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,680
know learning new material. It actually

351
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,959
impacts um mental health and resilience

352
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,440
long term.

353
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,320
>> Yeah. You know that that I I love

354
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,040
hearing that reflection. You know we at

355
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,120
open courseware at open learning we hear

356
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
from so many people around the world

357
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,240
that they've been able to make use of

358
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,360
our resources when they are living in

359
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,800
various sort of disrupted situations in

360
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,360
their lives. I mean lives are

361
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,759
complicated and having these materials

362
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,160
shared openly and freely with the world

363
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,160
you know you know clearly people's lives

364
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,000
have some stresses in them but they're

365
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:07,360
they're able to to tap into you know

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,679
some foundational I guess curiosities to

367
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,240
despite or working through with

368
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,559
resilience those disruptions continue to

369
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,480
keep learning and they you know they you

370
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,880
know we we love hearing the stories

371
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,720
reporting back about how you know they

372
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,319
you know continue to be able to keep

373
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,240
learning um you know um

374
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,600
you know people I'm remembering u

375
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
open course where we have this chalk

376
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,720
radio podcast and we just did a series

377
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,039
of hearing you know from learners around

378
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,520
the world specifically you know we heard

379
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,840
a story from a a person named Lafulla in

380
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,320
Afghanistan who you know

381
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,320
>> was living in a in a situation where you

382
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,440
know could not count on having internet

383
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,760
access from day to day from hour to or

384
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,640
um you know and all sorts of other

385
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,559
disruptions, but we're able to um make

386
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,360
use of the materials that we've shared

387
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,480
to keep learning and how just vitally

388
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,880
useful that that was. Um you know, we

389
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,760
hear those stories again and again, you

390
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,240
know, so it does it does seem to switch

391
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,480
something for people and uh really

392
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,440
really glad that we can can help support

393
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
that. Yeah.

394
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,880
>> Yeah. And it's it's um it's um the

395
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
occurrence of what you said is supported

396
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,760
by very you know clearly defined

397
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,000
structures in the brain. Um and again

398
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,840
it's the it's again the midbrain the

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,799
dopamineergic u subsystem in the

400
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,240
midbrain um mainly the vententral

401
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,360
tegmental area and the nuclear

402
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,240
circumbent which allow for this sense of

403
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,120
purpose right for this sense of of the

404
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,280
micro of maybe understanding it doesn't

405
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,360
have to be you know the big goal and the

406
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,520
big monster it can be the small gremlin

407
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,520
that you that you finally tame and you

408
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,760
learn how to deal with but it's those

409
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,000
micro wins those that that feeling of

410
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,960
process that you know I may not have

411
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,039
understood the full thing but at least

412
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,200
I've got this much you know I mastered

413
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,520
this much and maybe tomorrow I'll make

414
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,600
sense of the next bit and next week I'll

415
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,360
make this make sense of the next bit and

416
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,400
that gives a sense of of progress but

417
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,280
also of of purpose of goal directed

418
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,840
behavior which in times of hardship in

419
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,919
times of duress and distress is what

420
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,360
keeps you know keeps you going and It

421
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,720
could be it can be you know as little as

422
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,640
um you know like I said it doesn't have

423
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,559
to be abstract. It can be learning how

424
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,559
to play a new instrument or learning how

425
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,640
to that's not a small thing learning how

426
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,880
to code. I've actually approached

427
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,200
Annabelle's u um code AI and computer

428
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,320
science course so it reminds me of that.

429
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,120
Um, so yeah, maybe it has even a a

430
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,600
stronger impact on people who who who go

431
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,840
through through difficult times because

432
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,840
again it gives you that something to

433
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,480
look for to look forward to. That's

434
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,960
something to mobilize your resources

435
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,400
towards which is so important in um um

436
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,640
the staving of in in staunching symptoms

437
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,960
of of hopelessness which are very

438
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,280
closely linked with depression uh and

439
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,480
and crippling anxiety. So yeah, I

440
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,280
completely agree with you.

441
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. You're what I'm hearing in

442
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,559
your description is this this process of

443
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,840
building confidence bit by bit too. You

444
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,360
know, you start from a

445
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,039
>> from a place of

446
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,799
>> realizing, hey, there's something that I

447
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,400
don't know that I'm curious about and

448
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,880
building that confidence. That

449
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,120
confidence is can be really infectious

450
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,520
in a in a good way. Yeah.

451
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,679
>> Yeah. I I No, you you're spot on. Now

452
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,600
that I'm I told you I'm I'm learning I'm

453
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,240
approaching foreign languages and I was

454
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,400
saying to my friend when I sit down to

455
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,840
relearn I call it relearning Hebrew

456
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,679
because I sort of knew something from

457
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,200
before and I'm drawn to it because it

458
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,559
forces my brain to do things

459
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,120
counterintuitively the same way I I I um

460
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,200
experienced with when I started Iikido.

461
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,000
It's against the way my brain would do

462
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,440
it. Right? Not only is it right to left,

463
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,760
but it's a whole different grammar

464
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,400
structure. So it you know puts me in a

465
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,799
in a situation of discomfort. So um I'm

466
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,440
you know go I'm sometimes overwhelmed.

467
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,880
Um I'm I don't know whether I'll be able

468
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,799
to make sense of it but I the micro you

469
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,960
know there are micro wins. If I manage

470
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,880
to understand this much then the next

471
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,880
day I'll sit down and see okay let's see

472
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,640
what happens. Let's see what happens

473
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,320
today. Let's see what I make sense of

474
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,600
today. So I become a bit more confident

475
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,960
because it's yet another small milestone

476
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,919
uh that I've um I've conquered. I'm this

477
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,840
much closer to something which I don't

478
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,880
even know where it is in in time and and

479
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,520
space but I become more confident and

480
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,840
that takes me back to when I retrained

481
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,919
um in neurosychology. I remember I had

482
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,600
to learn a lot of neuroanatomy,

483
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:04,320
neurohysiology, diagnostics and it was

484
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,360
uh you know often times it was quite

485
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,840
intimidating. It was overwhelming. Um

486
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,480
but even you know the small win of

487
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,400
understanding how cranial nerves work or

488
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,400
finding the acronym to remember

489
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,400
something or nailing a small

490
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,480
differential diagnosis that um not only

491
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,919
did it make me happy right through the

492
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,520
same reward circuitry uh but it um

493
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,720
boosted my motivation the big M word to

494
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,960
carry on. Yeah.

495
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,960
>> So, um it actually kept me on track. Um

496
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,679
otherwise perhaps I would have given up

497
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,240
if I looked at this whole chunk as oh

498
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,960
god here's the big monster. So I agree

499
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,720
with you. Building confidence slowly um

500
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,039
is definitely um something that we see

501
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,440
um with with with lifelong learners,

502
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,919
people who engage in lifelong learning.

503
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
>> Yeah. Yeah. This brings to mind, you

504
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,360
know, stories that we hear from so many

505
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,080
people, especially older learners. I

506
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,480
think there's there's a way in which

507
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,480
>> we're conditioned as older people to

508
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,440
think we're supposed to know stuff,

509
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,000
right?

510
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,240
>> And that moving into that space of not

511
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
knowing can be sort of uncomfortable.

512
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,120
But we hear from so many people,

513
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,280
>> you know, I studied this subject back in

514
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,000
school and I it didn't make sense to me.

515
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,640
And

516
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
>> suddenly, thank you open courseware for

517
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,559
instance for giving me this alternate

518
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,159
explanation. Suddenly now I understand.

519
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,400
I've kind of recovered that sense of of

520
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,440
yeah, I can I can I can come back to

521
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,840
this and and take another try at it. Um

522
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,159
and just how transformative that could

523
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,320
be for, you know, for people no matter

524
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,120
what stage in life they're at. You know,

525
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,840
got to keep doing

526
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,440
>> Absolutely. It also, you know, I like to

527
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,600
say this tongue and cheek that it it

528
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,840
stops you. It prevents one from taking

529
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,640
oneself too seriously, right? Keeping

530
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,480
humble. Uh a lot of us especially if

531
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,559
there's something we become good at

532
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,159
hopefully uh we tend to think that we

533
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,320
know the answers to all the questions or

534
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,240
what we know is enough but it's always

535
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,840
good to have this reality check that you

536
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,320
know there's something there we you

537
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,720
don't know or there may be another way

538
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,360
to look at it and that again takes us

539
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,880
back to cognitive flexibility right is

540
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,880
something that tends to because of how

541
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,320
how brain function declines

542
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,919
physiologically cognitive flexibility

543
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,840
um fluidity of of thinking and of

544
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
appraising reality and what's being

545
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,320
internalized as knowledge is a bit lost.

546
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,799
So um you know working on that wiring

547
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,720
through lifelong learning through

548
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,080
complex work through um um like you said

549
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,799
you know learning new things or

550
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,240
revisiting new things through mentally

551
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,440
stimulating hobbies. Um it it sort of

552
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,120
allows for for the looseness of of that

553
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:01,120
circuitry to to be maintained and also

554
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,919
for um you know the

555
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,880
the the distance from yourself that

556
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,880
sometimes is needed to just be able to

557
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,960
to learn new things and to look at the

558
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,039
world with different eyes. It's a it's a

559
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,360
it's a humble thing

560
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,840
>> uh to be able to do that later in life.

561
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
>> Yeah.

562
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,400
Do you ever have people who who have

563
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,240
learned about your story uh say

564
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
something like, "I just don't know how I

565
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,159
would have time to learn all of these

566
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,600
things. How do you how do you find the

567
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,360
time? How do you create that?"

568
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:41,520
>> I get that in the sauna. I get that uh

569
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,640
at work. I get that uh I get that. Um

570
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,039
and I my answer is how do you know I

571
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,720
actually get that question? My answer is

572
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,039
usually, well, I'm old, so I've had time

573
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,200
to do all those things. That's usually

574
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,640
my go-to get out of jail free card. I

575
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
usually say, well, you know, I'm old.

576
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
I've been around since forever. I've had

577
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,320
I've had time to do these things. But

578
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,200
then you know maybe the more complex um

579
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,159
less tongue and cheek answer would be

580
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,960
I've um

581
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:18,960
I've

582
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,960
I don't I I really enjoyed what I did. I

583
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
never even now people say oh why do you

584
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,200
swim 5 days a week? I'm actually enjoy

585
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,440
doing it. It's not something it's not an

586
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,000
ordeal. Most of the things I've done

587
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,039
I've done because I was really drawn to

588
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,159
them. So for me it's joy. This is joy.

589
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,840
Um I mean there are clearly things that

590
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,159
I would rather not do and there are

591
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,919
there just to maintain something you

592
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,760
know like you know having to do strength

593
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,120
in order to maintain flexibility. Um but

594
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,919
I actually like you said it's

595
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,600
self-relenishing it's self-perpetuating

596
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,520
like now I can't stop learning these

597
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,200
foreign languages. I actually I I wake

598
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,080
up and I think you know you know maybe I

599
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:04,080
want to make sense of that. Um so I

600
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,200
think it's just it's it's something that

601
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,840
um I was encouraged to do also. I had

602
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,960
good uh parental encouragement growing

603
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,120
up and luckily I had the uh you know the

604
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,159
context in the environment to pursue

605
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,760
some interests. Um

606
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,080
and

607
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,159
I maintained like I like I said it's

608
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,720
practice. I I I I maintained the the

609
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,960
curiosity and the motivation

610
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,440
and also the discipline which is

611
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,000
deserves another conversation all

612
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:42,080
together to to do these things and then

613
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,080
you know to complete the answer they've

614
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,600
brought me enough reward to keep me

615
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,760
going

616
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,320
um it was not something I did just for

617
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,120
the sake of doing I've I got a lot out

618
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,240
of it enough to to keep going.

619
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,159
>> Yeah. Yeah.

620
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,840
>> Um

621
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,360
curious to hear a little bit more maybe

622
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:07,279
about your sense of of the the social

623
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,159
aspects of being a lifelong learner. Um

624
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:14,240
in addition to all the things that we

625
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,399
individually are drawn into. Um um how

626
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,279
have how have you experienced in your

627
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,679
life um sharing it with other people or

628
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,320
bringing bringing other people into

629
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,840
these sort of journeys and uh things you

630
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,200
might want to share with share with our

631
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,120
viewers about that.

632
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,520
>> Um

633
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,159
well you you hit the nail on the head is

634
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,840
like you you read my mind. Um I actually

635
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:43,679
meant to bring this into a conversation

636
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,320
how um and and maybe you know part of it

637
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,120
I discuss is sort of a fiction context

638
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,480
in this book I've finished uh writing

639
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,799
how important the social dimension of

640
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,279
learning is in general and also how

641
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,720
important it's been for me and how

642
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,120
intrinsic it is to sometimes just stay

643
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,600
on track and to maintain the motivation

644
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,640
to keep going And it's something which

645
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,000
is perhaps um slightly waning in the

646
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,559
modern world. Um the act of learning

647
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,720
with others, the act of sharing

648
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,799
knowledge with others, uh you know,

649
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,279
we're in this together as hard as it

650
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,360
gets. Uh you know, we're learning this

651
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,480
together or we're learning from each

652
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,120
other to me has has been very important.

653
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,279
Although um in terms of personality

654
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,159
maybe I actually prefer especially when

655
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:38,720
it comes to abstract knowledge to to

656
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,840
learn alone but um then I like to uh I

657
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,080
like to share I like to um have somebody

658
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,559
to um have shared reflection with and it

659
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,600
also helps with accountability you know

660
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,200
um I I remember it could be it could be

661
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,720
a a discussion forum but um learning

662
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,919
with somebody else uh a study buddy

663
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,799
right preferably a human study buddy um

664
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,480
helps with um I've already mentioned

665
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,200
accountability and you know

666
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,600
comprehension and um sharing

667
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,559
understanding of material but what it

668
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,240
also does um I've noticed especially

669
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,080
when you know you study something which

670
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:24,559
is hard and um there are obstacles along

671
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,679
the way and and fatigue um

672
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,600
rears its ugly said having having a

673
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,840
study buddy um helps with eliminating or

674
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,320
reducing the sense of isolation that can

675
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,440
come out of you know months and months

676
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,480
of being engaged in in hard study and

677
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,919
it's sometimes it's that sense of

678
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,159
isolation that can halt progress. So to

679
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,320
me it it's been important to have

680
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,840
somebody to um when it came to academic

681
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,559
pursuits it was important to have

682
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,799
somebody to even meet and have a

683
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,039
conversation about you know tomorrow's

684
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,240
exam or what had to be studied. I was

685
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,480
lucky to have a good friend in

686
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,880
university and I'm forever grateful to

687
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,679
her for you know being my study buddy

688
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,440
human study buddy. Um and when when it

689
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,720
comes to other types of learning, of

690
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,200
course, um you know, just sharing the

691
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,159
fact that uh you know, let me show you

692
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,399
how I um learned to play guitar or you

693
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,159
show me this dance piece and I'll try to

694
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:31,360
copy you. It creates um a sense of

695
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,440
cohesion and also a sense of mastery. Um

696
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,399
like I've I've mentioned before, a sense

697
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,240
of efficacy. I'm showing you that I'm

698
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,480
good at this. I'm showing you that I'm,

699
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,960
you know, I'm I'm I'm competent enough

700
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,919
to do this. And then there's the, you

701
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,559
know, then there's the the

702
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,679
feedback that comes back to me and I

703
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,320
feel competent, right? Through the same

704
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,840
social reward and the circuitry that

705
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,000
supports it is back mirrored to me and

706
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,760
in turn I feel more competent and that's

707
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,679
extremely important and again it helps

708
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,320
with with resilience, you know, with

709
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,960
grit.

710
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,799
>> Yeah. So um social learning I I couldn't

711
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:19,039
encourage it more. Um and

712
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,200
the um the I think learning per se we've

713
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,880
already said you know all the we've

714
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,640
already outlined the benefits the

715
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,440
lifelong benefits that come with just

716
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,480
being engaged in in in learning but

717
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,840
there's also the aspect of you know if

718
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,200
we were to to visualize this in a sort

719
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,399
of visual vignette you have

720
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,200
this learning window or or door let's

721
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,360
call it and you of curiosity and

722
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,559
motivation which help you take the first

723
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,039
steps through good job I didn't say

724
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,039
window um so they tell you you take the

725
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,519
first step through the learning door

726
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,200
>> and then you have the discipline and the

727
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,320
rigor and the structure which keep you

728
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,760
on track but then I think you also need

729
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,919
a sense of community to to anchor you

730
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,399
into something which hopefully will

731
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:13,200
become larger than yourself

732
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:16,320
um so u I'm I couldn't stress more the

733
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,640
uh the the benefits of of social

734
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,840
learning and just you know doing it with

735
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,320
other humans.

736
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,120
>> Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. It makes me

737
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,519
think of MIT's motto, you know, mind and

738
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,120
hand, you know. Yeah. Yes. There's the

739
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,880
there's the the learning part of it, the

740
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,720
intellectual part of it, but the hand

741
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,039
part, the doing

742
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,960
>> in particular, I think has this way of

743
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,279
just bringing other people into the

744
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,120
process. you know, we we demonstrate the

745
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,880
things that we're learning, you know,

746
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,159
through the through the hand, through

747
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,399
the activities out in the world. Um, you

748
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,039
know, we're creating opportunities to

749
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,600
engage with other people. Um, you know,

750
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,840
I know in my in my personal life, I've

751
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,679
been on a learning journey for over a

752
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,080
decade about um, climate change and how

753
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,720
how to respond to these, you know,

754
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,919
intersecting challenges and, you know,

755
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,560
the things that it calls me into, you

756
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,119
know, to to share my learnings have to

757
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,960
do with like how do how do how do we

758
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,440
show up for civic engagement, you know,

759
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,399
as a citizen, how to how to get engaged

760
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,919
there. Um, so there's this there's this

761
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,399
continuous feedback loop between

762
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,919
learning new things and showing up in

763
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,000
social spaces, you know, to uh both

764
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,839
demonstrate what I've learned, but also

765
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,399
ask those questions that are still

766
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,440
ringing that uh sort of lead me into

767
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,919
into the next thing. Um, I'll also note,

768
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,800
you know, yeah, it's not part of MIT's

769
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,440
official motto, but informally mind,

770
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,200
hand, and heart, you know, showing up

771
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,720
for all of this, you know, with our with

772
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,520
our full selves is a is a really

773
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,760
important part of it as well. Um, and I

774
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,440
I I think of uh of the heart part of it

775
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,520
as as very connected with um, you know,

776
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,320
that feeling of curiosity. What is it

777
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,160
that that spark or that that small flame

778
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,240
that that opens up as kind of the heart

779
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,720
piece? So, yeah, just enjoy riffing on

780
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,280
that for a moment. Yeah.

781
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,320
>> Yeah.

782
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:19,680
>> Yeah. I um No, I I I I totally agree and

783
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:23,040
I absolutely love um MIT's moto. Um

784
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,079
I like you know like maybe I mentioned

785
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,640
earlier this this aspect of of embodied

786
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,359
cognition and I touched on it briefly

787
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,720
earlier when I um and I when I mentioned

788
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:38,079
multimodal learning and you know just um

789
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,480
learning through all modalities which is

790
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,800
actually actually preferred and um the

791
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,599
brain likes that because it recruits

792
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:53,839
more areas it allocates more resources

793
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:55,520
is from various bits. Um and um

794
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,079
it's also a very it's quite it's been

795
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,880
quite the buzz word in the uh in the

796
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,760
last few years embodied condition and

797
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,040
how because you know there's both top

798
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,200
down regulation of of processes and

799
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,520
bottom up right it's not just the brain

800
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,640
dictating everything into the body. It

801
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,400
actually what happens in how how emotion

802
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,839
and behavior arises is both top down and

803
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,160
bottom up. What comes through the

804
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,839
senses, what comes from the outside

805
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,320
going all the way up into the higher

806
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,119
instances of the brain and top down as

807
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,200
well. So I'm I'm happy you touched on

808
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,640
that because it's linked with as I said

809
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
this buzz word.

810
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,480
>> Yeah.

811
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,640
>> In body cognition.

812
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,359
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And if I may, um,

813
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
reflecting on the social aspect of this,

814
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,520
we're so grateful for all of the people

815
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,160
who are who are watching our live stream

816
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,280
right now and and, uh, who registered

817
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,839
and we got so many questions from

818
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,359
people, you know, right about the sort

819
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,920
of broader themes that we'd be talking

820
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,520
about today. Maybe maybe I'll turn some

821
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,599
of our attention to what we've what

822
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,920
we've heard from those questions here.

823
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,400
Um I think we got over a hundred

824
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,599
questions that were submitted and our

825
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,320
team has has uh done some valiant work

826
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,800
trying to group these into some themes

827
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
um you know that that people out in the

828
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,440
world are cur are wondering about you

829
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,480
know especially around curiosity. So

830
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,240
here's this.

831
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,280
>> Yeah, here's this first one.

832
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,359
>> Um, Beia, do you think curiosity is a

833
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,839
learnable skill?

834
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,079
>> And if so, what strategies might help

835
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,040
individuals and communities to develop

836
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,400
and reinforce and

837
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,599
uh carry it forward?

838
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,359
>> Uh, curiosity we've said, right? CU is,

839
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,079
let me think of other questions. So, is

840
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,280
curiosity learnable? um

841
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,839
>> or can it be developed? Maybe maybe

842
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,839
>> can it be enhanced? Right. So

843
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,920
>> straight straight off the bat there are

844
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,640
no chemical you know pharmacological

845
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,839
stimulants uh that could enhance or

846
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:06,480
create uh curiosity at least not in a

847
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:08,800
healthy way. But there are um there are

848
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,440
cognitive and emotional conditions that

849
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,839
we could create to enhance uh curiosity.

850
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,280
Well, that this question actually very

851
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,040
good one takes me back to what we

852
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,119
mentioned earlier, right? About

853
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,520
curiosity arising when the brain detects

854
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,920
this information gap, right? So, why do

855
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,079
we become curious? Because we know that

856
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,320
there's something we don't yet know or

857
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,119
we can't yet do or we don't yet

858
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,240
understand, but we could. So the brain

859
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,359
sets in motion uh it's you know tried

860
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,000
and tested ways to make us motivated to

861
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:48,560
go out there and you know find the

862
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,280
missing piece in the puzzle. So how you

863
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,040
know how could we how could we create

864
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,680
the context in which curiosity peaks?

865
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,760
Um

866
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,599
I've I've noticed both in dance and

867
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,000
neuroscience that but mainly

868
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,160
neuroscience has confirmed this that the

869
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,839
human brain likes and at the same time

870
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,520
hates um incomplete puzzles

871
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,599
>> and that's tied in with the information

872
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,320
gap. When the brain detects that there

873
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,560
is a missing puzzle, it will it will

874
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,079
increase motivation to go out there and

875
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,800
find it. Right? We like we like to find

876
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,280
the missing gap. So sometimes if we

877
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,240
frame the learning material and the

878
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,839
question in such a way that we sense

879
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,800
that there's something we don't yet

880
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:38,000
know, our brains will do what needs to

881
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,839
be done to put us in the situation where

882
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,599
we can go out and you know find the

883
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:47,599
missing p the missing piece. So um

884
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,640
that's usually a strategy. Then um you

885
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,920
know novelty novelty is you know

886
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,760
bringing new things into into our

887
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,520
reality into our um environment can can

888
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,760
um can can spike curiosity. Brain loves

889
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,400
novelty. Um new new perspectives, new

890
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,640
ways of looking at the world, new new

891
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,040
tools, new tools are great. Like how do

892
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:19,920
I use this? new angles into a into a a a

893
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,680
problem. Um that's that's what uh

894
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,760
novelty

895
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,520
spikes curiosity.

896
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,800
Um also um that gets me thinking about

897
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,160
something that a friend of mine

898
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,520
mentioned the other day. Um Tim he said

899
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,359
that um he you know he feels more

900
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,440
curious and more motivated to do things

901
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,960
and also performs better when he feels

902
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,560
free

903
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,280
or I would say I would say autonomous

904
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,440
>> um yeah and just to get my disclaimer in

905
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,160
early by autonomous I don't you know I

906
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,400
don't mean anarchy by autonomy I mean

907
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,040
the freedom to to explore to sometimes

908
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,160
choose the question rather than um

909
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:05,359
engaging in the type of learning that

910
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,839
where you you just have to to learn

911
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,760
given material all the time. The sense

912
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,160
of agency, the sense of, you know, I'm

913
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,920
the one who does the exploration and

914
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,760
sometimes if it we don't choose the

915
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,800
answer, we at least choose the question.

916
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,560
M

917
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,760
>> um also you know feeling you know the

918
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,480
sense of sometimes

919
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,400
feeling safe maybe that's the word and I

920
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:33,280
will explain the sense of um you know

921
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,520
that low stake not always engaging in

922
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,680
low in high stakes environment not that

923
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,400
their environments not that they're bad

924
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,040
and they're not uh conducive to progress

925
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,000
or or or mastery or competence but

926
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,880
because the constant involvement ment in

927
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
a high stake slightly threatening

928
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,720
environment dampens curiosity. As we've

929
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,560
said before, curiosity spikes when the

930
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:02,160
brain shifts from threat perception

931
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,319
networks to exploratory networks. So

932
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,640
sometimes feeling a bit looser, a bit

933
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,520
more comfortable in an environment with

934
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:13,359
lower stakes can set off exploratory

935
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:17,280
behavior. um if we're constantly engaged

936
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,200
in in in learning um activities that

937
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,440
titillate the brain's defense

938
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,599
mechanisms, we tend to become less

939
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,920
curious and then motivation goes down a

940
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,560
bit. So

941
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,480
to answer the question, you know, frame,

942
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,280
you know, look for puzzles, incomplete

943
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,920
puzzles, um novelty, autonomy to explore

944
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,760
and then, you know, find environments

945
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,440
where you feel looser, you know, not

946
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,319
constantly judged, not constantly

947
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,680
evaluated and stuck labels on. I think

948
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,240
that helps with long-term sustainment

949
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,240
and uh um

950
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,640
and you sustainment and enhancing of of

951
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,480
curiosity and the motivation to back.

952
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:04,000
>> Yeah. Good. Yeah. Um

953
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,240
it it leads me to another set of

954
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,800
questions we got from from some folks

955
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,440
which I will I will summarize is while

956
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,920
we've been singing curiosities praises

957
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,760
you know are there ways in which you

958
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,680
know one might be too curious are there

959
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,440
are there are there ways that we might

960
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,280
want to think about managing that

961
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,520
curiosity to particular ends versus just

962
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,200
welcoming it

963
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,359
with

964
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,280
Okay, that's an interesting question.

965
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:37,280
Becoming too curious as in dabbing into

966
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,760
>> an excessive number of interests.

967
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,960
>> Yeah. Well, I think we can interpret it.

968
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,760
You know, you you were talking about

969
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,319
novelty and how novelty is a is a the

970
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,160
brain loves novelty. Um I assume

971
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,920
>> No, you're right. The brain Yeah. No,

972
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,839
you're totally right. The brain loves

973
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,319
novelty. But if there's one thing that

974
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,160
the brain can't do, as much as we would

975
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:59,119
like to think that and as much as you

976
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,880
know uh biohackers promise us, uh the

977
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,359
brain can't process unlimited input.

978
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,079
>> Yeah.

979
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,920
>> Right. Um,

980
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,560
cognitive fatigue is a real thing and

981
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,720
it's mainly due to the prefrontal cortex

982
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,680
which is you know sits just here below

983
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,359
the forehead uh being metabolically

984
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,400
extremely costly and uh it fatigues

985
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,280
easily and performance uh performance

986
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,040
goes down. So,

987
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:33,119
um, if becoming too curious about too

988
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,760
many things at one specific time leads

989
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,040
to cognitive overload,

990
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,240
then you have a problem, right? Because

991
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,960
there's, you know, there's mental

992
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,280
clutter. You won't see clearly. You

993
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,920
won't see as clearly. the brains

994
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,359
analytical instances won't be as well

995
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,160
equipped to one comprehend and make

996
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,160
sense of what's being learned to also

997
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,480
evaluate evidence right if it's

998
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,359
something that you know requires you

999
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,880
know seeking truth or you know figuring

1000
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,800
out whether you know trying to make

1001
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,920
sense of things that mental clutter that

1002
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,200
um prefrontal fatigue right prefrontal

1003
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,079
fatigue actually it it the prefrontal

1004
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,599
cortex

1005
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:20,880
fatigues because of two for two reasons.

1006
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,599
One uh when multitasking and two when

1007
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,119
having to switch between uh sources of

1008
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,520
information. So you know um being too

1009
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,760
curious as in being a bit

1010
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,319
>> uh you know jumpy and frivolous about

1011
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,880
what you allow your attention to go

1012
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,960
towards if that leads to cognitive

1013
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,119
overwhelm that those analytical

1014
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,319
instances of the bra of the brain won't

1015
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,040
do their job.

1016
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,359
>> Yeah. as well. Yeah. So you need to you

1017
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,800
need to filter, you need to curate and

1018
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:54,240
then to focus and concentrate just to

1019
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,480
keep uh just to keep cognitive uh

1020
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,440
fatigue and cognitive overload from

1021
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,240
happening. So I would say that is that

1022
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,760
is a caveat when when plus you just

1023
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,760
don't have enough attentional power.

1024
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,960
It's it's mainly an issue of um of of

1025
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,839
computation

1026
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,960
>> mainly it's just brain limitation

1027
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,119
>> but um you know when one you know

1028
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,240
maintains enough distance to become

1029
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,240
their own filter and curator then

1030
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,480
hopefully you know it will get distilled

1031
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,160
to what actually deserves your attention

1032
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,599
and what doesn't.

1033
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:32,400
>> Yeah. it uh this this makes me think of

1034
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,560
um of this interesting balance that we

1035
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,599
have found ourselves in with open

1036
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:42,240
courseware and our MITx you know free

1037
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:44,480
online open courses um that there's a

1038
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,079
way in which the sort of information

1039
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,720
system online is now really good at

1040
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,240
feeding that wish for dopamine hits

1041
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,359
right and the novelty continuous

1042
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,280
>> um

1043
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,880
>> and on the other And there might be

1044
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,599
things that that are out in the world

1045
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,760
that are just like too big to take on,

1046
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,400
right? You know, require too much

1047
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,480
persistence. But by by sharing materials

1048
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,160
like open courseware does, here's

1049
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,520
materials framed within say a course in

1050
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,560
which they were taught, but here's the

1051
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,400
materials openly for you to sort of make

1052
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,119
your way through. There's enough of a

1053
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,480
container that that you can sort of

1054
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,240
match your persistence at the moment to

1055
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,839
track your way through.

1056
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,640
Um it's it's it's like the best of both

1057
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:34,640
worlds if you will. It's like yeah all I

1058
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,960
completely agree all of this all of this

1059
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,280
stuff to feed your curiosity but just

1060
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,800
contain it enough to walk you through

1061
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,359
it. That's

1062
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,280
>> that's what

1063
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,880
>> and that also restores a bit of agency

1064
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,040
if you like you know you're the one who

1065
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,040
who chooses what what you know what's

1066
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,560
internalized instead of everything

1067
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,000
coming towards you and being a bit

1068
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,400
overwhelming. Um I had that issue. I

1069
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,200
remember when I approached uh MIT

1070
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,880
courses I was I want oh god what do I do

1071
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,800
I want to do everything and then I had

1072
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,720
that and I had the immunology course and

1073
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,839
I had Patrick uh Winston's I had the AI

1074
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,560
course and then I I had the mind and

1075
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,560
machine course. So, but it had um I

1076
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,880
noticed that the structure in which

1077
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,880
they're they're presented and then the

1078
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,280
individual structure of the individual

1079
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,800
courses actually um helped me tone down

1080
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,760
that initial anxiety and I was like,

1081
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,000
"Okay, hang on. I can sort of find my

1082
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,040
way through it." So, it wasn't that that

1083
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,359
overwhelming.

1084
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,760
>> Yeah.

1085
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,559
>> Yeah.

1086
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,720
>> Yeah. It's it's a it's a helpful feature

1087
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,040
to not have a defined end date where you

1088
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,599
have to finish it all by Right.

1089
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,640
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1090
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:49,359
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, we got some

1091
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:52,880
other questions um about

1092
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,240
the the the shifting information, you

1093
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,119
know, content landscape [clears throat]

1094
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:00,160
out in the world, you know, um, you

1095
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,200
know, and between say all the all the

1096
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,119
shows that we can stream online and, you

1097
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,800
know, short form videos that social

1098
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,599
media is pushing out. Um, what role do

1099
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:16,480
you think on an ongoing basis platforms

1100
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:19,839
like MIT Open Learning can play in

1101
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,079
in fostering, supporting uh, stewarding

1102
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,680
that sort of like ability for deeper

1103
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,200
learning? This is kind of building on

1104
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,079
what we've just been talking about, but

1105
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,280
maybe anything more to think about there

1106
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,359
with like

1107
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,559
>> opportunities for open for for deep

1108
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,640
learning, you know? Yeah. Deeper

1109
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,040
learning, you know, beyond the, you

1110
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,000
know, the the short form stuff or the

1111
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,200
pure entertainment stuff. Yeah. [snorts]

1112
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,240
>> Yeah.

1113
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,240
>> Well, I think the crux [sighs]

1114
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,119
is

1115
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:53,760
maybe sounds a bit, you know, elitist,

1116
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:56,400
the quality of it, right? the rigor, the

1117
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,960
um the fact that it's not something you

1118
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,960
can it's not I mean it is entertaining

1119
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,040
and it's it's definitely rewarding but

1120
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,200
it's not something you can just brush

1121
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:09,359
the surface of right. It's not something

1122
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,280
that can be you just take a look at and

1123
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:14,240
you dab in and out of this course and

1124
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,800
then you move on to another. It takes it

1125
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,520
takes a certain amount of engagement

1126
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,119
depth of engagement. Does this answer

1127
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,200
your question? Yeah. Yeah.

1128
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,040
>> Um I it's something that again takes me

1129
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,319
back to what we were saying earlier

1130
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,960
about the protective effects of of

1131
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:35,440
lifelong learning and its implications

1132
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:40,079
on you know mental health and wellbeing

1133
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:42,800
and resilience. And there are you know

1134
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:47,200
maybe two things to note. The benefits

1135
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:51,440
we outlined are dose dependent and also

1136
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,079
cumulative. Right? you don't um you

1137
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,559
don't derive the same benefits if you

1138
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,240
dab in and out of interests and you

1139
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:03,119
don't do it in a sustained uh type of

1140
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:06,079
rigorous engagement. And I think at

1141
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,720
least the courses I've uh I've completed

1142
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,880
and the ones I'm I'm looking at now

1143
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,640
don't really allow for that type of

1144
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,720
entertainment

1145
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,440
involvement. You have to you have to

1146
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,319
apply yourself and again without that

1147
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,079
threat that can that can arise from you

1148
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,240
know to too high stakes like you said

1149
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,000
you pace yourself and there are micro

1150
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,319
wins and it comes with sheets and you

1151
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,440
can do you know you can do the exercises

1152
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:34,400
and then you can do the you can read the

1153
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,640
you do the assignments and

1154
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:42,240
um it it sort of requires a certain

1155
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,640
level of of depth

1156
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,240
um from the learner in terms of

1157
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,839
engagement that um underpins uh deep

1158
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,640
learning and the benefits that come with

1159
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,319
that.

1160
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,680
>> That's what I think.

1161
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,800
>> That's what I've noticed.

1162
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,720
>> Yeah. Good. Yeah. In in conversations

1163
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,160
with colleagues around here, you know,

1164
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,880
we we we are talking increasingly about

1165
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,160
how to how to complement that depth with

1166
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,880
like the right forms of engagement. um

1167
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,119
uh you know to have things be MIT good

1168
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,680
without you know right off the bat

1169
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,440
having them all be so hard [laughter]

1170
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,040
academically

1171
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,640
um uh colleagues over at the at the MIT

1172
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,000
Museum who are talking about this

1173
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,480
concept of depth on demand right where

1174
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,280
you where you meet people with you know

1175
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,880
really engaging things you know to sort

1176
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,400
of peique their curiosity but then be

1177
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,559
able to flow through and follow through

1178
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,599
with that uh feels like a really

1179
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,240
important

1180
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,240
um uh set of things to be developing

1181
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,599
over time and I look forward to uh us

1182
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,720
being able to get into that more and

1183
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,680
more.

1184
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,680
I think I think you know hard you know

1185
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,800
the the hardness difficulty is some

1186
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,040
something that people go for at least

1187
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,119
myself when I um when I looked at these

1188
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,359
courses I was actually quite happy that

1189
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,720
they're hard that I didn't understand

1190
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:07,760
because and it's it's normal I think for

1191
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,760
for periods of of of overwhelm and doubt

1192
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,800
and fatigue to occur because the courses

1193
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,480
are so so difficult and so rigorous but

1194
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,960
again if we look at it from from a

1195
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,760
neuroscient perspect perspective. It's

1196
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,599
that level of challenge and that limbic

1197
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,000
friction. We call it that friction, you

1198
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,680
know, that that sense of I'm I'm a bit

1199
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,200
overwhelmed and I'm a bit scared. But

1200
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,520
it's exactly that that

1201
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,400
sense of challenge that drives uh

1202
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,280
neuroplasticity and then helps with the

1203
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,240
motivation to stay on track. So I'm sure

1204
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,000
that um other people will agree um the

1205
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,359
reason why we approached these these

1206
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,559
courses is that they were well excellent

1207
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,640
right exquisite in terms of the quality

1208
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,720
of the material and how they're taught

1209
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,319
but also because they're just in that

1210
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:58,160
goldilock zone of of difficulty right if

1211
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:01,119
something is too easy the brain gets

1212
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,520
bored if something is too hard then

1213
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,680
those defense mechanisms we I mentioned

1214
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,800
earlier are titillated and the desire

1215
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,040
ire to keep going is is is dampened. But

1216
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,920
I think they're um you know they they're

1217
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:17,280
they're perfectly poised on that angle

1218
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,520
of the Goldilock zone of just above that

1219
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,440
level of competence and you know maybe a

1220
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,839
bit higher for motivation to keep you

1221
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,760
going. So I was happy that they're hard

1222
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,640
and you know some of them were so hard

1223
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,839
that I you I have chunks of them that I

1224
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,000
don't I couldn't approach fully

1225
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,960
>> uh professor ran Adams's uh quantum

1226
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,680
mechanics one god I got to the harmonic

1227
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,440
oscillator bit I still even now I have

1228
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,680
shivers down my spine and it took me

1229
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,760
quite a while to work my way out of that

1230
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:50,079
jungle in murky waters

1231
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,480
>> but uh I had a human study buddy and uh

1232
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:57,200
I was I think disciplined enough to keep

1233
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:58,720
going. Um, so yeah, I I kind of like uh

1234
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,640
the fact that they're, you know, just

1235
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,400
the, you know, they're a bit harder than

1236
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,400
than my uh muscles uh can fight.

1237
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,920
>> Okay. Well, that material is will always

1238
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,640
be there for you, so you can keep coming

1239
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,480
back to it. Yeah. So, I think we're uh

1240
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,280
we're about to draw to a close. Maybe

1241
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,359
I'll um pose this very briefly. One last

1242
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,240
question from our audience about, you

1243
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:22,720
know, any thoughts on sort of cultural

1244
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,720
or organizational practices that might

1245
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,200
help foster this sort of environment.

1246
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,880
For for me, for instance, that raises,

1247
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,119
you know, um something that we're very

1248
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,359
committed to, which is this sense of

1249
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:37,200
knowledge as a public good. That this

1250
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,960
this knowledge being out there and

1251
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,720
shared freely with the world and

1252
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,280
supporting that is a really important

1253
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,079
cultural practice that sets the stage

1254
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,079
for people such as yourself to have

1255
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:51,359
access to these materials. And if you

1256
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:53,520
know if any brief thought on a cultural

1257
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,000
practice that you would like to see

1258
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:00,079
supported more to help foster this sort

1259
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,559
of curiosity, I'd love to hear about it.

1260
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,760
>> The first thing that comes to mind and

1261
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,240
maybe not the most relevant one is

1262
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:12,079
linked is connected to what I said

1263
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,799
earlier, the the the sense of safety.

1264
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,319
>> Yeah.

1265
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:20,559
>> Um the sense of low stakes, right? the

1266
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:24,880
sense of looseness and and autonomy, the

1267
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:28,640
not always having to do something

1268
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:31,599
um for some extrinsic good, right? the

1269
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:34,480
sense of I'm doing this not because I'm

1270
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,720
judged and not because there's always a

1271
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,280
job down the line and I have to complete

1272
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,240
this course otherwise I won't keep the

1273
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,880
job and I have to complete this program

1274
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,559
in order to uh you know exceed to you

1275
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:52,640
know a better job and and whatn not to

1276
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:55,680
to to sometimes keep it low stakes and

1277
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,400
not with either a hatchet above one's

1278
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,799
head or with an immediate

1279
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,799
goal which is maybe not even related to

1280
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,839
the to the main interest in the first

1281
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:09,119
place. But to allow for for for

1282
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:12,559
curiosity and and supporting motivation

1283
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,160
to arise naturally to allow for more

1284
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,160
looseness

1285
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,960
um in people to to to move and and

1286
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:26,319
choose their areas of interest and uh

1287
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:30,559
then pursue it in a less judgmental

1288
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:33,119
way. um you know just people feeling

1289
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,559
more supported and and and lifted. I'm

1290
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:41,839
using dance tones rather than constantly

1291
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:44,240
you know evaluated and pushed u in a you

1292
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:46,160
know do this so you can grab the other

1293
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,839
type of way. Does that make sense?

1294
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,720
>> Yes, it sure does. I think that's a

1295
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:53,359
wonderful sort of way to to to wrap the

1296
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:58,480
conversation. you know, may we all find

1297
00:57:53,359 --> 00:58:00,319
