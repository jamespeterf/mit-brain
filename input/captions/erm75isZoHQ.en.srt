1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,759
it's truly an honor to have you here and

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,320
it's mindblowing to sit through the day

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,359
of presentation after presentation that

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,320
inspires in yet another dimension um the

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,560
state of MIT Nano as an organization is

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,080
very simple we are extremely lucky to be

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,720
where we are being embedded in the MIT

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,240
Community allowed us to reach dimensions

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,400
and be exposed to Comm to sub

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,040
communities of it some of which we

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,239
didn't even know existed some of them

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,320
are even formed through the accumulation

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,200
of the user after user into the tools of

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,480
MIT n um six years ago when we opened

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,680
October 2018 uh we had no users because

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,480
we had no tools our first users arrived

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,000
roughly in January 2019 and today there

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,000
are

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,559
1,500 individuals plus some that utilize

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the tools of MIT know uh 340 of them are

21
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,920
not from MIT there are humans that saw

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,759
that we have the tools and we are

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,040
absolutely delighted to offer those

24
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,640
tools to them in those 350 individuals

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,600
outside of MIT you'll find over a 100

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,560
different companies most of them

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,119
startups and many of those supported by

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,320
some of our programs like star. Nano

29
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,240
that indeed you had the choice to be

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,000
exposed to a bit uh through the session

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,840
that Joyce would L earlier today I'm

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,280
tremendously thankful to you for

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,720
spending the entire day with us I look

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,360
forward to what's next there are many

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,280
many great things that come next you can

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,000
maybe find out about some of them by

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,280
joining us for the reception that is

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,719
coming up next so relocate from here you

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,360
can join us in the first floor of MIT

40
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,520
Nano both east west lobby and most

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,759
importantly the space in between that we

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,399
call our Gallery you will for the first

43
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,960
time be able to see our rejuvenated

44
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,720
gallery that was turned on last night

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,520
and that does at this moment display a

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,760
series of recently captured digital

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,360
images from the various nanoscale

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,000
Dimensions we have captured on tools of

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,400
MIT Neno please do stop by please do

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
keep celebrating up with us indeed this

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,120
is our sixth anniversary and we very

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,440
much look forward to indeed engaging you

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
in whatever is next hopefully you

54
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,560
realize if you're one of the

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
corporations that are members of ILP or

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,720
indeed just want to know about m n the

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
strength of your ability to learn is not

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,480
just seeing us on Zoom or finding online

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,599
things we do indeed it is that human

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,400
friction and engagement that lead you to

61
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,480
the next set of grand ideas you might

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,760
have 10 ideas I might have 10 ideas if

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,400
you stay home that that's 20 ideas Al

64
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,480
together but if we meet there are 100

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,000
permutations of the way way your 10

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,159
ideas and mine can be combined and that

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,120
is where the Innovations happen that's

68
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,040
why I say the most dangerous place at

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,720
MIT or in the most dangerous thing to do

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,440
is to stop someone in a corridor and ask

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,040
them so what do you

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,040
do because you'll be left with the next

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,239
hour of just true amazement as we have

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,440
been throughout the whole day today

75
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,280
listening to our colleagues thank you so

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,680
much for spending the time with us and

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,480
we'll see you next year but first of all

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,200
maybe we'll see you in the lobbies of M

79
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,360
Nano celebrating uh at our reception

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,360
thank you
