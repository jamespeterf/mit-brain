1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,519
okay so good

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:24,000
afternoon and uh

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,160
uh we

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,359
are hopefully we'll uh

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,000
finish the topic on uh liquid VAP or

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,000
equilibria

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,360
today now

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,079
uh we we have seen that everything is uh

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:53,719
contained in mechanical

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:56,000
potentials and uh so this U summarizes

11
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,480
for example for a pure substance when

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,640
you have the two phases in mutual

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,040
equilibrium like liquid and

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,000
Vapor the equality of chemical

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,759
potentials uh for the pure liquid and

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,280
the pure uh

17
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,799
Vapor gives a relation between pressure

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,400
and temperature which we call

19
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:22,320
Pat or the inverse function is tat

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,600
that's what you find in for example the

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,000
steam tables for water or every other

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,400
substance has

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,680
this uh establishes the PO the boiling

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,759
point at a given

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,520
pressure so the equivalent for a binary

26
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:44,320
mixture is that now we have if if both

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:47,600
substances are volatile and

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,320
condensible then you have two uh

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,840
chemical

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,119
equilibrium uh chemical potential

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,200
equalities that are required for Mutual

32
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,159
stable equilibrium between the two

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,479
phases of course uh the chemical

34
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,039
potential be is now not only a function

35
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,599
of temperature and pressure but also of

36
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,520
composition but because this the mole

37
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,560
fractions add up to one uh you just need

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,200
one uh in independent mole fraction to

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,200
represent the

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,080
composition but you need one mole

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,840
fraction for the uh liquid phase and

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,480
another mole fraction for the vapor

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,879
phase because they are not necessarily

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:38,160
equal so these two

45
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:40,239
equalities in the uh four variables TP

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,640
y1f and

47
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,760
y1g can be solved to

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,760
give uh this relation so you only have a

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,480
variance of two GES a phase rule

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,280
variance of two meaning that for example

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,480
if you fix temperature and

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,720
pressure that automatically fixes a

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,640
unique composition for the liquid and a

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,760
unique composition for the uh Vapor that

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,480
are not equal and the Raul's law that we

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,840
have

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,400
developed establishes the relation

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,760
between the composition of the in vapor

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,480
and the composition of the

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,680
liquid

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,760
uh you can also rewrite solve these

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,159
equations for other inde independent

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,000
variables for example you keep T and the

64
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,519
mole fraction of the liquid and you get

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,879
a from these relations a function which

66
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,120
we called the B the bubble

67
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:44,760
line or if you instead like to keep the

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,120
temperature and the composition of the

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,120
vapor you get the DU

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,760
line which can be expressed as pressure

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,840
is a function of temperature but also

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,439
temperature is a function of

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
pressure okay so these are all

74
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,680
equivalent

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,560
forms and here is a sort of a thre

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,439
dimensional representation of how these

77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,360
uh things look of course in the limit of

78
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,079
the pure substances you get the usual PT

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,440
diagram for that

80
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,440
substance this is for one this is for

81
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,000
two but uh halfway when the mole

82
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,960
fractions go from between zero and one

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,240
then you get uh uh these

84
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:40,680
relations uh as we have seen gives rise

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,880
to gaps so to Regions that are forbidden

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,240
that cannot be uh

87
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,800
obtained uh in in which the substance

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,639
doesn't behave in doesn't exist in

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,160
stable equilibrium it likes to

90
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:02,039
separate so today uh to finish up we

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,039
need to see a little more about about

92
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:10,240
this so the first uh result that we can

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,080
uh talk about is called enry

94
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:19,759
law which is a byproduct of R's law so

95
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:24,960
remember R slow was a relation here this

96
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:28,800
one uh that gives us as we just said the

97
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Rel the composition of the vapor phase

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,600
in equilibrium

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
is a function of the uh composition of

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,800
the liquid phase with which it is in

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,080
mutual

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,479
equilibrium and the saturation pressure

103
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,560
of the pure substance enters in the RS

104
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:50,840
equation we derive this by equating the

105
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,000
chemical potentials of substance

106
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,080
one and

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,080
U of course if you have if your mixture

108
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,360
is

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,880
ideal uh at all

110
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,880
compositions and both substances are um

111
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,319
volatile and condensible you have also a

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,880
r slow for the second second substance

113
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,639
and so you have the same expression like

114
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,120
here only with the subscript two instead

115
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,960
of

116
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,520
one

117
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:27,800
however very few

118
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,800
mixtures uh in the liquid phase are

119
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,360
really uh ideal

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,440
at all

121
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:42,160
compositions but we

122
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:43,360
know that in a dilute limit so for a

123
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,759
dilute

124
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:52,520
solution uh we argued that every liquid

125
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,720
solution is always uh in that limit

126
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,319
behaving as

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,240
ideal so that means let consider

128
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:05,199
component one as the solvent for

129
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,319
which uh this equation is

130
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:13,960
valid in the limit

131
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:16,879
of uh y1f that means uh the liquid

132
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:22,080
composition is very close to the pure

133
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,080
substance so that's a dilute solution

134
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:32,080
limit substance two does not behave a

135
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,879
slope but we will see that now next

136
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,479
lines are going we're going to need to

137
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:41,039
prove this relation here which looks uh

138
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:45,080
which is enry law which looks

139
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,000
similar to R's law except that instead

140
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,800
of the saturation pressure of the

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,599
substance of the second

142
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,599
substance you

143
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:56,720
have uh another function of not just

144
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:00,199
temperature but temperature and pressure

145
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,520
which is called enris volatility

146
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,960
constant and it's going to be given by

147
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,010
this relation here so how do we how do

148
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,319
we obtain this and this is

149
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,879
[Music]

150
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,400
valid

151
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:17,120
um for any uh mixture in the dilute

152
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,479
solution limit there is a there is a a

153
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,360
constant like that it's called Enis

154
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,599
constant but it's really a something

155
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,879
that is independent of composition and

156
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,560
it's a function but it is a function of

157
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,120
temperature and pressure so it's

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,959
constant once you f F temperature and

159
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:40,080
pressure so where does it come about

160
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:42,880
come it comes about from the Gibs doem

161
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,160
relations because they can they must

162
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,080
always hold remember GBS do relations

163
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,080
are the ones that we use also to derive

164
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,200
the GI phace

165
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,880
Rule and the clus claperon

166
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:00,600
relations for the pure

167
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:04,160
substances uh for a binary mixture

168
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,640
uh the usual summation becomes just two

169
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,440
uh contributions here so this is uh

170
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,920
minus sdt plus

171
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,680
VDP plus the summation minus the

172
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,640
summation of the mole fractions times

173
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,640
the D of the chemical

174
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:23,000
potentials now suppose we fixed

175
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,120
temperature and pressure so we set DT

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,839
and DP equals z then you see this gives

177
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:34,200
a relation between how uh the chemical

178
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:37,079
potential of uh the second substance so

179
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,959
of the solute in the dilute solution uh

180
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:44,560
changes as uh you have changes in the

181
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,560
chemical potential of the solvent so

182
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,560
they are not

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:57,200
independent so if since this

184
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:01,880
solvent uh behaves like like this it's

185
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,000
ideal so it obeys this uh ideal relation

186
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,760
for chemical potential if you do the

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,320
differential of that uh at constant T

188
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,360
and

189
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,640
P you are left with just the the

190
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,440
differential of log of Y which is the Y

191
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,800
over y okay so that's the mu1 in the

192
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,640
liquid phase so you can substitute in

193
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,640
this relation

194
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,640
here so see this relation it can be

195
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,640
Rewritten this

196
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,040
way and then here for this one you

197
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,880
substitute what we obtain from the ideal

198
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,279
solution and here is what you get you

199
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,200
get a similar

200
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:48,560
relation so you get that also chemical

201
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,800
potential of the second substance in the

202
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,720
liquid uh solution behaves

203
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,720
logarithmically with the

204
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,760
composition so that means that

205
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,800
if it is

206
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,760
logarithm see this for the ideal

207
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,200
solution this is a logarithmic

208
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,200
dependence and here you have the pure

209
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:17,000
substance so the the constant here is a

210
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:19,440
pure substance whereas for a oops okay

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,120
whereas for for this other case if you

212
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
integrate this

213
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,480
relation uh you get something similar to

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,360
the one up there but uh with a different

215
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,480
integration constant that is not NE

216
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,680
necessarily equal to the pure component

217
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,160
chemical

218
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,000
potential it is equal to the pure

219
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,519
component chemical potential in the

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,680
limit of Ideal solution all at all

221
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,560
compositions so but in general this is

222
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,680
some other function of temperature and

223
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:56,320
pressure which nevertheless can be

224
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,600
measured and uh and therefore you uh if

225
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,760
you use this relation to obtain like we

226
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,800
did for a obtaining R's law you obtain

227
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,000
enry

228
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,240
law and here is the explicit expression

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,360
that derives for theis constant in terms

230
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,959
of the saturation pressure of the second

231
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,880
substance there is this correction

232
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:21,800
factor and this correction factor can be

233
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,800
very uh large for

234
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,720
example

235
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:33,560
um one one important example in in some

236
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,440
practices is is the one for nitrogen so

237
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,639
the AR is

238
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:44,760
constant as a value which is

239
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:48,399
85,000 atmospheres so very high

240
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,279
pressure uh from the point of view of of

241
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,399
graphic point of view um okay suppose

242
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:59,600
this one is mole fraction of the solvent

243
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:03,639
say that we are talking about uh water

244
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,639
okay so this is the dilute limit is is

245
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,800
is in this area

246
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:13,320
so Mo fraction of water is very close to

247
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,800
one and so what is missing to get to one

248
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,800
is the mole fraction of the

249
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:23,399
solute and supposed solute is

250
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,639
nitrogen uh okay uh the

251
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,600
N slope me if you had ideal ideal um

252
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,720
Behavior

253
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,760
H this line represents the the partial

254
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,120
pressure so it's the product of uh mole

255
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,880
fraction and

256
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,399
pressure and it's a straight line

257
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,920
because that's a linear relation that

258
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,600
takes you to the um saturation pressure

259
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,639
of uh

260
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,680
nitrogen okay uh since this Conant is

261
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:01,040
very high the en constant is very high

262
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:05,360
the actual slope here is much

263
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:09,480
steeper okay and that is sort of the

264
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,079
tangent of this uh IDE non- ideal

265
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,720
Behavior U

266
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:20,320
um Bubble uh bubble

267
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,560
line now it why nitrogen is

268
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:28,720
important for example for uh

269
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,680
divers you know that there is this um

270
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,279
problem of the compression and if you if

271
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,360
you dive and you stay for a long time uh

272
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,680
at high

273
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,120
pressures

274
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,680
nitrogen uh uh you see here if if I

275
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,040
increase uh the the

276
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,959
pressure the the mole fraction uh that

277
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,160
of nitrogen that can stay in uh in the

278
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,639
liquid so let's say the let's call it

279
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,720
the solubility of nitrogen in the

280
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,880
blood uh gets

281
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,639
higher so the longer you stay the more

282
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,120
nitrogen goes into your

283
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:20,480
blood and then uh and this happens in

284
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:24,800
the lungs now if you uh come up to C

285
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:30,040
Surface too quickly and you don't let uh

286
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,160
uh the necessary time to adjust back uh

287
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,160
through the

288
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:40,160
lungs uh this nitrogen will um evaporate

289
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,639
from your bloodstream and form bubbles

290
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,560
all over and these

291
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:50,639
bubbles uh typically collect in

292
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,440
joints and gives you a lot of pain

293
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
especially when you move the joints and

294
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,880
that's why the disease is called also

295
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,880
the bends when you bend you you suffer

296
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:05,759
uh but of course the enris Conant has

297
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,360
also some other applications that also

298
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:14,079
have to do with uh atmospheric and ocean

299
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:18,920
science and uh so this is

300
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:21,720
um for example it determines

301
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,959
the the

302
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:29,839
the

303
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:33,360
uh composition of clouds Cloud droplets

304
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,920
and also it is important in how for

305
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,160
example pollutant some pollutants are

306
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,279
absorbed in Waste Water Management uh

307
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:46,120
plans treatment

308
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:50,040
plans okay so this was an example of

309
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:54,959
application of the Gibbs DM

310
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,959
relation which has some practical

311
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,240
applications um okay before we go on I

312
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,079
have

313
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,760
to stress again something that we have

314
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,919
already discussed so I'm not going to go

315
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,480
into too many details here but I I leave

316
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,919
it this slides for

317
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,720
reference

318
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:24,559
because when we like we're going to do

319
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:28,360
next we deal with models of uh

320
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,840
mixtures to describe U these nonideal

321
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,840
behaviors

322
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,799
um we are going to have to be uh

323
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,559
concerned with the stability or the

324
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,640
solubility limits uh uh the stability

325
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,559
conditions for these mixtures because

326
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:53,600
sometimes uh for example liquids you

327
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,760
know oil and water don't mix at least

328
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,679
not at all

329
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,760
compositions uh so that is an effect of

330
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,880
the the fact that at certain

331
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:08,919
compositions a a a

332
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:12,960
homogeneous mixture of oil and water is

333
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,960
unstable at most

334
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,280
compositions all right well so our

335
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,400
models will will give uh expressions for

336
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,240
the uh GBS free energy and you can

337
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:32,640
express the G free energy as

338
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,679
the total value or the specific value

339
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,799
and of course if we we are we are

340
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,600
talking

341
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,480
about large systems with large numbers

342
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,559
of particles so we uh the we can apply

343
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,440
the oiler relation and this is uh the

344
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,120
fact that the GS specific GS free energy

345
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,880
is essentially you can write it as the

346
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,600
weighted sum of the chemical Potentials

347
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,600
in weighted by the mole fractions of the

348
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
components

349
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,039
uh but we have remember that see you

350
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,440
might be tempted to say that the the

351
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,960
chemical therefore the chemical

352
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,600
potential is the derivative of little G

353
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,320
with respect to

354
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,080
Y but it is not that's why you have to

355
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,360
be careful the chemical potential when

356
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,480
you want to write it in terms of the G

357
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,480
fre energy is the partial of the G three

358
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,919
energy capital G with respect to

359
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:36,799
n at constant TP and all the other ends

360
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:40,000
okay and if you do all the correc

361
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:44,440
steps here it is here is the expression

362
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,720
in terms of the uh specific Gibs free

363
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,799
energy there are lots of contributions

364
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,600
it's not just the partial of G with

365
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,520
respect to

366
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,200
Y there are other

367
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:03,320
stuff for example

368
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,480
if you assume uh if you apply this to

369
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:11,280
the GI free energy of the ideal

370
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:14,679
solution which we discussed last time

371
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:19,600
also which is given so by only by this

372
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:23,960
term plus the mixing mixing entropy type

373
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,960
term and you do this derivative

374
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,880
here you so you see that this this

375
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:34,039
derivative of of the um lowercase G with

376
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,440
respect to the mole fraction is equal to

377
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:40,720
the pure component plus something like

378
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:44,280
that so there is an RT term uh uh too

379
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,400
many which makes it different from the

380
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,919
uh

381
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,919
ideal chemical

382
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,600
potential but if you put this expression

383
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,600
into here then you get the

384
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,840
proper expression for the clinical

385
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,919
potential for a binary

386
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,200
mixture which is something that so these

387
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,400
are relations that we will need uh in a

388
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,440
few moment

389
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,440
moments the for a binary

390
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,640
mixture uh the specific EX3 energ is

391
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,159
function of only one mole fraction of

392
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,880
course because the other is is one minus

393
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:23,799
one my 1us

394
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,720
y1 the chemical potential if you use

395
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:29,720
this

396
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,720
expression can be written this way

397
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,600
and for the second component can be

398
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,120
written this

399
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,720
way in terms of the derivative of little

400
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,200
G with respect to

401
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,840
Y and uh

402
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,919
so why where where do we need these two

403
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,360
expressions we need them when we want to

404
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,080
apply the conditions for Mutual

405
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,960
equilibrium between two

406
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,000
phases because if we have the two phases

407
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,480
in equilibrium component one must have

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,120
the same chemical potential in both

409
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:08,320
phases and component two also so this

410
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,440
gives give two relations and these two

411
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,159
relations can be

412
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,880
written from these two relations you can

413
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:19,080
obtain this by substituting the

414
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,679
expression about these two expressions

415
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,720
here so it tells you that uh uh the

416
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,679
partial of G with respect to

417
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,919
Y must be equal for the two phases even

418
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:35,159
if this derivative doesn't represent the

419
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,279
chemical potential but only a part of it

420
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:42,360
still it has to be equal for the two

421
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:45,840
phases and plus it represents a slope

422
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:51,400
that of a geometrical construction that

423
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,200
uh uh looks like this so if I have if I

424
00:22:51,400 --> 00:23:00,400
plot uh

425
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:04,159
G with respect to uh mole fraction why

426
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:09,720
sometimes we will see you get

427
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,720
uh Expressions I mean plots like

428
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,520
this and we will see that uh the

429
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,600
condition for Mutual equilibrium the

430
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,760
first one this

431
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,760
one says that if there are going to be

432
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,440
if if you find a line which is tangent

433
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,440
both here and there

434
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,679
okay

435
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,600
almost okay so this slope is

436
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:45,640
DG uh d

437
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,240
y also there but here is evaluated at y

438
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,200
Prime

439
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:55,880
first uh phase one and here it is

440
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,880
evaluated at y double

441
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:04,720
Prime so that uh so finding this tangent

442
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:10,000
line identifies those two mole

443
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,000
fractions that are in neutal

444
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:20,640
equilibrium and also see this is G Prime

445
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,640
and that's g double

446
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,039
Prime and as you see the equation of

447
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,760
this

448
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:32,559
line is precisely

449
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,559
this equation

450
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,880
here okay so that

451
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,159
construction helps us identify for a

452
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,520
given uh temperature because here we

453
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,520
have fixed a given temperature and

454
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:54,279
pressure it helps uh identify these two

455
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,279
points

456
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,600
so

457
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:10,799
again that means suppose I fix now the

458
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,919
pressure and I take that

459
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,240
temperature so at this temperature

460
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,799
T I'm going to

461
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,399
plot these two points that I have found

462
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,399
y Prime and Y double

463
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,039
prime those this represents

464
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:39,039
uh the two phases in mutal

465
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,080
equilibrium so this would be say y1 for

466
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:47,200
example for the for the phase

467
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:51,039
um this would be y1 F and this is y1 G

468
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,880
if you're talking about liquid Vapor

469
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,120
equilibrium now if I change the

470
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,240
temperature and make another plot of the

471
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,120
same kind I'm going to identify

472
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,240
by the same

473
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,080
way the two

474
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,279
other uh compositions that are

475
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,159
correspond to the mutual equilibrium and

476
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,520
so

477
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,200
on until I get to a temperature in which

478
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,520
these Point are going points are going

479
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,720
to coincide so I'm going to

480
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,720
obtain a curve like

481
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,760
that maybe it's a bit smoother for in

482
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,430
practice

483
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,960
uh this is called this is a critical

484
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:39,360
[Laughter]

485
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,120
point uh it's critical in what sense

486
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,039
it's critical in the sense that above

487
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,640
that

488
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:51,679
temperature you can see that all

489
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:55,080
compositions are possible for

490
00:26:51,679 --> 00:27:00,960
equilibrium whereas below

491
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:03,760
here there is a gap so this area

492
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,200
here is

493
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,200
forbidden and it's called the visibility

494
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,120
Gap there are no stable situations

495
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,120
inside

496
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,840
here but as we have seen for the pure

497
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,240
substance we may have a metastable

498
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:30,159
situations which is

499
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,159
now what we want to uh analyze

500
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:38,640
so let's try to do that construction

501
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,240
with one of the uh models that we have

502
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,480
assumed the simplest the one parameter

503
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:50,039
marulas model for the binary mixture so

504
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:54,880
just parameter a so the Gibs free

505
00:27:50,039 --> 00:28:00,120
energy is a sum of an ideal part and

506
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,120
excess part the ideal part is given

507
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,960
here something can be computed from the

508
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,360
pure substance properties something is

509
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,480
related to the entropy of

510
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:17,559
mixing and then here the excess part is

511
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:22,760
related to the composition and to this

512
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:29,080
constant a which you remember is is is

513
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:30,919
a essentially the uh mixing enthalpy

514
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,000
of the two components which in this

515
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:38,200
model are equal for the two

516
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,760
components okay so that's the

517
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,919
model

518
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,039
now we

519
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:46,720
apply uh the

520
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,240
stability

521
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,799
conditions because you remember that for

522
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:56,720
Mutual I mean for stable equilibrium

523
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:59,559
we've derived while ago U General

524
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,320
conditions for stability that are not

525
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:07,760
just yes they are the theoretical things

526
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:10,799
but which have practical consequences

527
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,640
consequences uh and that therefore allow

528
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,640
to describe uh some physical

529
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:25,159
reality okay so the second differential

530
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,640
of G um if I move out from a state in

531
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,559
which the system is in equ mutual

532
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,600
equilibrium with Reser at temperature T

533
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,200
and P and uh and I move out uh by

534
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,559
changing the

535
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,559
composition while keeping T and P

536
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,720
constant uh this differential must be

537
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,720
greater than zero so that

538
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:54,480
implies that if I uh keep also n among

539
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,720
the various possibilities uh I can of

540
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,760
changing the composition I'm taking the

541
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,559
simplest so I take uh uh keep constant

542
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,919
the total amount and just change the

543
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:05,360
relative

544
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,480
composition so I just change the mole

545
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,919
fraction of component

546
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:16,240
one and this second differential

547
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:19,159
uh gives rise well maybe here more than

548
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,080
an equal sign there should be an arrow

549
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:25,559
because this is not an equality it's

550
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,840
wrong mathematically but uh because here

551
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,840
should we should have also a d uh

552
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,840
y1

553
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,640
squared which being squared as

554
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:41,120
a positive sign so it doesn't that it's

555
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,760
always

556
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:49,559
positive so I have to correct that

557
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,559
and so this uh is the second derivative

558
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:56,399
and on this graph the second

559
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:58,720
derivative is the convexity no of the

560
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,000
curve it has to be

561
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,880
positive so you we see here that uh it's

562
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,600
positive here it's positive here it's

563
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,480
positive up to a certain point here but

564
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,399
then it becomes negative second

565
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,559
derivative so from from where it becomes

566
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:19,559
negative to where it comes back

567
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:24,159
positive this is the region of

568
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,960
instability and these two points here

569
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,240
are going to

570
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,559
Define so they're not they there are a

571
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,679
different uh there are a different uh um

572
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,000
mole

573
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,960
fractions than the two phases in a

574
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,960
mutual equilibrium so see this is a

575
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,240
different mole fraction and a different

576
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,679
mole fraction so this will identify

577
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,559
another

578
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:53,039
curve inside

579
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:56,279
here so the locus of all these other

580
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,600
points this other curve is what we will

581
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:03,960
call uh this spine noal

582
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,320
curve so usually one calls this one is

583
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,320
called

584
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:13,080
bodal and the one inside that's the SP

585
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
no

586
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:18,399
SP

587
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,799
okay so we have the expression for the G

588
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,440
free energy we can take derivatives let

589
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:31,880
me skip the steps and go to the uh

590
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,159
result here this is the second

591
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,000
derivative it's in terms of the mole

592
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:42,639
fractions RT and a the constant

593
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,639
a for this to be greater than

594
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:51,000
zero I see this is subtract so you need

595
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,960
that a should not be too too

596
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,639
large the maximum value of this fraction

597
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:03,720
is one is um is two no is four because

598
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:06,639
half and half and therefore a equals 2

599
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,639
is the maximum

600
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,720
allowed value so the stability condition

601
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:18,880
is satisfied is if a is less than

602
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,360
two the critical situation is when a is

603
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,360
equal to

604
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,799
two and if a is greater than two

605
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,559
uh you can

606
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,000
still

607
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,000
satisfy this

608
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,600
condition but only in a certain range

609
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,559
see this is the expression is a like um

610
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,240
a second order equation so you can solve

611
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:58,600
it and you find uh this range so this is

612
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,679
the um this is these uh this mole

613
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,200
fraction and that is this other mole

614
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:08,599
fraction as a function of parameter

615
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,800
a so this is one part of the condition

616
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:17,079
for it's a necessary condition for

617
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,440
stability but the other condition for is

618
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,119
that the the two phases are in mutual

619
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,119
stabil stable equilibrium and therefore

620
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,720
you also have the conditions that the

621
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,720
chemical potentials must be

622
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:32,800
equal and this two conditions

623
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:35,679
essentially are correspond to this

624
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,200
construction of the tangent line that we

625
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,200
just

626
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:45,399
described so this equation here if you

627
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,440
fix an a you

628
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:53,040
find uh you find the mole fractions of

629
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,040
the phases in mutual

630
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,560
equilibrium so this is easy enough that

631
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,960
you can implement it for example in an

632
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,480
Excel

633
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:10,280
file H so you see the the Gibs free

634
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:12,599
energy uh little G uh mol is given by

635
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,000
this relation it's the sum of the two

636
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,760
contributions the

637
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,320
ideal which is

638
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:26,640
this and the excess which is

639
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,480
that okay in this case for a less than

640
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,920
two at all

641
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,839
compositions the second derivative of G

642
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,119
is positive and we have

643
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,000
stability so at

644
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,040
this uh in general this a depends on

645
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,960
temperature let's say these

646
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,640
temperatures uh so um the two liquids

647
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,640
are completely

648
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,280
missible as you decrease the temperature

649
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,800
the Val the value of a changes and

650
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,040
eventually you reach the critical value

651
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,440
a equals

652
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,599
2 at that

653
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:09,440
moment you still are okay in terms of

654
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:13,680
stability but there at the minimum here

655
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,160
um you have a second order derivative

656
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,160
equal to

657
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,880
zero not a minimum at this at some point

658
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,079
you get a second order second Dera equal

659
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,079
to zero

660
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,200
of course this plot for these plots we

661
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,119
had to assume something about the

662
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,079
properties of the pure substances so I

663
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:44,359
assume the these values 02 for one

664
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:50,119
substance and point uh uh four for the

665
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:53,560
other if you uh Set uh uh lower

666
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:58,960
temperature so you go to a greater than

667
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:04,560
two then you get uh partial Miss

668
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:08,480
ability you get this uh

669
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,240
uh mbil Gap so from the spinoid

670
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,319
composition here to the spidal compos

671
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,839
composition there for the liquid and the

672
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:19,760
vapor there is the this entire uh range

673
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,960
of compositions in which the mixture

674
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,359
doesn't

675
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,640
uh want to

676
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:30,480
stay so if you find if you manage to

677
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,319
produce a mixture with this composition

678
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,599
at these conditions of temperature and

679
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:37,359
pressure it will separate spontaneously

680
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,480
in search for

681
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,440
stability and it will

682
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,160
form

683
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:51,200
um two phases so it will form a phase in

684
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:55,200
which uh uh which is rich in component

685
00:37:51,200 --> 00:38:00,280
one this one and a phase in which is

686
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:02,000
lean in component one which is this and

687
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,920
eventually it will reach Mutual

688
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,240
equilibrium I mean it

689
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,720
will will face

690
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,280
separate uh to two phases that are in

691
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,280
mutual equilibrium at these

692
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:19,480
compositions okay these equations are

693
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,800
again that constructions that we'

694
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,800
already

695
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:27,599
done so if you uh

696
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,079
by some means for example one

697
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,480
possibility is to start from a mixture

698
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:40,760
at a temperature above

699
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,960
critical uh say here and then you find a

700
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:47,119
way to quench

701
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:51,040
it much like what we discussed also for

702
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:55,920
the Vander bals spinodal decomposition

703
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,040
so you quench to this uh Point

704
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,240
here uh

705
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,079
and uh so you uce the temperature at

706
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,280
this point the the

707
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,839
instability uh

708
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,440
triggers what you see uh here it

709
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:17,119
triggers that the fact that from

710
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:21,599
homogeneous the phases uh U begin to

711
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:25,720
separate because substance one uh either

712
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:30,319
wants to be close to uh a lot of

713
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:35,480
substance ones one or or a little of sub

714
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:40,280
substance on so it you get diffusion U

715
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:44,400
uh process and this is

716
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,839
fast because you have uh uh as we have

717
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,960
seen for the Vander vals case we have a

718
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:56,440
lot of free energy available to create

719
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,280
uh the um the surface that separates the

720
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,839
two phases

721
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,599
and then once that

722
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,400
happens

723
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,560
uh

724
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:10,960
coalesence

725
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:14,079
makes uh uses up that surface

726
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:18,240
energy and tries to to find

727
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:21,800
configurations of of lesser uh um free

728
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:26,440
energy by um

729
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:30,839
making drops or bubbles uh drops in this

730
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:35,960
case uh uh bigger and

731
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:39,000
bigger and also here if you do the

732
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,319
separation uh if you do this quenching

733
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,720
at

734
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:49,280
exactly the critical comp uh

735
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,480
composition then uh the mixture the

736
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,040
separation as you see doesn't doesn't U

737
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,880
um

738
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:03,359
either neither do U uh drop drops nor I

739
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:08,000
mean doesn't do yeah in the Vander vals

740
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:12,119
it's neither drops nor bubbles here it's

741
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:17,119
uh it's drops in in all cases but you

742
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,119
see instead of drops it's continuous uh

743
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,920
um continuous

744
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:28,520
regions that become gross and

745
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:32,560
grosser if you instead are

746
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:36,839
off critical on either side uh you get

747
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:40,680
drops of uh one into a

748
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:43,680
continuous um region of the

749
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,680
other

750
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:52,119
okay now there is also this uh region

751
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,880
here of meta stable States between the

752
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:58,359
spinodal and the binodal uh

753
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,000
curve there is a a

754
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:05,400
metastability and these metastable

755
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:09,440
states are uh interesting because

756
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:12,000
sometimes they uh can be used for

757
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,680
applications for

758
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,800
example this is uh

759
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:22,599
you U I know that

760
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:26,880
um one of you is Greek and so uh

761
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,640
certainly knows uh this uzo effect but

762
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,720
uh

763
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,160
these

764
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,359
um uh in the

765
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,800
Mediterranean there is these liquers

766
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,280
that uh have very different names so

767
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,960
let's see I wrote them down because I

768
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:47,920
forget like in France get Anette or ptis

769
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:50,240
and uh in Italy sambuka that one I know

770
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,520
uh turkey is

771
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,760
raki in Colombia uh there is some kind

772
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,559
of

773
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:01,319
guent which is um flavored with with

774
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:05,720
anet with

775
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:08,160
Anis uh Mexico also has its own and also

776
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,559
uh some of the

777
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,720
uh Egypt

778
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:18,839
and Israel have

779
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,839
araq uh so essentially this is

780
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:28,359
uh the the funny thing of these U

781
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:31,040
liquers is that they they are

782
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:34,200
transparent

783
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,599
so and when you mix it with water which

784
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,839
is another transparent

785
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,640
liquid they become they give you a Milky

786
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:49,119
kind of

787
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:52,280
opaque um thing so that's um always a

788
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,079
sort of a mysterious U effect if you see

789
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,079
it the first

790
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,440
time uh it turns out that this effect it

791
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,359
has been named Uso effect only

792
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,200
relatively recently maybe 20 years ago

793
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:11,880
when somebody uh some real

794
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:15,400
scientist uh visited the

795
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,800
Mediterranean uh but

796
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,880
um and it is not spinodal

797
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,880
decomposition it is just the

798
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:28,000
fact uh that you start you generate a

799
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,559
mixture okay this has to do

800
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,280
this is more complicated because it's

801
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:36,480
not a binary mixture it is a three

802
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,319
component mixture it has uh water it has

803
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,760
uh

804
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:44,640
alcohol which is

805
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:49,160
ethanol and it has a little amounts of

806
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:54,240
this um oily thing that you extract from

807
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:58,319
the seeds of uh the of a plant of of a

808
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,920
flower that is called an amet or

809
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,720
something like

810
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,000
that no I don't have the name of

811
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,720
that

812
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,119
uh I think the chemical uh the the

813
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:17,760
chemical composition of this oily thing

814
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:20,839
that gives the flavor is trans anol and

815
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:25,040
it's like C10 h12

816
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:28,720
o you find uh all these in in these um

817
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,640
nice articles that give U the scientific

818
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,680
explanation and from which I have

819
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,680
extracted these

820
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,520
pictures so the idea here is that you

821
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,760
have

822
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:45,359
uh uh three

823
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,800
substances so let me just uh see uh they

824
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:52,079
call it

825
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:55,520
dvb in that uh graph that this plays the

826
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,040
role of the an is uh an his

827
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,520
um yeah

828
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:04,400
an

829
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:07,480
is oil but I don't think they prefer to

830
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:11,160
do it with a polymer that has

831
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:14,720
polymeric oil that uh so they used d d

832
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,559
venil Benzene so this is

833
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,559
D

834
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,240
vile

835
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:28,920
Benzene at least in their experiment so

836
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,920
let's say this is a substance uh C

837
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,559
okay now it turns out that this

838
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,559
substance is

839
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,079
soluble in

840
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:46,000
alcohol is not soluble in

841
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:03,280
water so let's call water B

842
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:06,200
and alcohol a okay so

843
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,760
essentially here we

844
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,720
have the mole

845
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,079
fraction of the organic oil that uh

846
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,640
that's our

847
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:20,520
C and this is the mole

848
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:24,200
fraction of uh the uh ethanol which is

849
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:27,319
our a

850
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:31,599
okay this is how this the the the the

851
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:33,040
equivalent of this diagram looks at a

852
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,040
fixed

853
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,040
temperature as function of this

854
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,760
compositions of course the mole fraction

855
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:49,280
of water is one minus the sum of these

856
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:55,119
two hence the uh triangular uh line

857
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,119
here so up up here we got just pure

858
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:01,640
water uh if you plot this uh since is

859
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,160
very skewed if you plot it in a

860
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,559
logarithmic scale in the composition of

861
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,119
the organic

862
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:11,640
oil uh this is how it

863
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:11,640
looks it opens

864
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:23,720
up so what you typically have is

865
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:29,079
uh Uso is a is a is a 40% by volume

866
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:32,200
meaning about 35 or 34 % by weight and

867
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,520
here is by weight uh so this is the

868
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,880
alcohol

869
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:40,160
content and let's say the content of

870
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:46,280
this oily um

871
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:49,640
an organic oil uh extract from these

872
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:53,920
flowers from these seeds suppose is this

873
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:58,280
much okay what happens is when you add

874
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:01,240
water you dilute the solution and so the

875
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:07,000
the fraction of ethanol goes down from

876
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:09,839
35 say to uh you cross this line and you

877
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,319
get into the the metastable

878
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:15,880
region in that metastable

879
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:19,000
region you get an

880
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:24,680
immediate U

881
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,680
separation or formation of these minute

882
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,200
droplets which then

883
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:34,160
because you so you

884
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:36,920
release the excess G gives free energy

885
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:41,079
that forms those minute

886
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:46,720
droplets those droplets are the the

887
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:51,880
reason uh why then uh light does

888
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:54,359
not get through gets diffused by these

889
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:57,799
droplets so that's why the

890
00:49:54,359 --> 00:50:01,640
liquid uh loses the transpar to

891
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:04,599
light it's the the reasons are these

892
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,799
droplets but differently from spinodal

893
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:10,240
De composition if you

894
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:13,240
had generated this kind of situation

895
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,319
from the unstable State H the separation

896
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,680
would would have been uh much more

897
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:21,599
vigorous and it would

898
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:26,799
generate have more energy so generate

899
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:29,119
bigger uh drops in the end and and

900
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:31,799
eventually the mixture will uh will

901
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,799
separate or maybe in any case it will

902
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:39,000
form bigger drops whereas uh in the oo

903
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:42,520
effect you generate you produce very

904
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,160
small uh droplets they they remain in a

905
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:52,960
sort of an Emulsion that is relatively

906
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:52,960
stable in other words it survives uh

907
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,480
hours and u

908
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:03,200
and in some

909
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,160
cases this kind of process is wanted

910
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,680
because uh there are applications in

911
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,839
which you want to generate

912
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:16,160
emulsions uh which is precisely a

913
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:20,599
mixture of of a solvent with a lot of

914
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:25,559
small droplets in it uh like when you do

915
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:29,640
vinegret that's an Emulsion and

916
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:32,520
uh many times in order to uh produce

917
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,040
emulsions you need uh surfactant but

918
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:38,200
this is

919
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:42,599
instead a way to

920
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,599
produce uh emulsions without

921
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:51,520
surfactant and chemical industry is full

922
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:56,119
of processes that go back and forth uh

923
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:59,920
with with this kind of uh of of effects

924
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:04,160
in know order to uh separate or mix and

925
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:09,839
uh uh generate uh things

926
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:14,559
also uh I think that this um this method

927
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:18,319
has also been used in order to generate

928
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:22,839
scuffles for biological applications for

929
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:24,760
example uh because if you once you have

930
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:28,920
this Emulsion you freeze

931
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:32,079
it in such a way way

932
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,839
that uh okay if you freeze it in such a

933
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:39,480
way that the the the bul phase remains

934
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:42,760
liquid and the uh the droplets be become

935
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,559
solid then you've generated small

936
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,559
spheres so in this this is a way in

937
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:53,680
which you produce small

938
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:55,680
feares or conversely if you uh perhaps

939
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,960
not these ones because they are not

940
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,040
connected and so if you freeze

941
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:03,640
this and

942
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:06,400
uh uh the the liquid droplets remain

943
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:09,319
liquid you you still have droplets and

944
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,799
you not there is no path for the liquid

945
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:15,760
to go away but if you use a situation

946
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:20,520
like this one generated by a spinodal

947
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:23,839
decomposition and you freeze then uh uh

948
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,520
you because there is a path in which the

949
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,480
say the the the dark phase becomes soft

950
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:33,640
solid and the liquid in the white phase

951
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:37,760
can drain away and then you you produced

952
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:41,160
a a a porous material which can be used

953
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:45,680
with a high surface um material that can

954
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:48,599
be used for uh enhancing or studying uh

955
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,119
biological but also for other uh

956
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:54,079
applications in which you need you need

957
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:57,359
a lot of surface for things to happen

958
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:04,440
like uh catalysts

959
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:04,440
uh okay all right so with this

960
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:12,280
uh I think we

961
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:18,920
can terminate the mixture stuff at least

962
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:22,400
uh uh of that kind but uh we start with

963
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:25,799
mixtures that are subject also to

964
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,799
chemical reactions

965
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:35,920
so this is uh the two main um situations

966
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:40,280
that we will uh

967
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:43,440
approach uh at the beginning

968
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:46,240
here it's two kinds of

969
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:50,079
systems in which we have chemical

970
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:55,520
reactions one is a closed system and the

971
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,520
other is a open system

972
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,160
so this is a model for a batch process

973
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:05,160
and this is a model for a uh steady

974
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,799
state flow

975
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,799
process or flow

976
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:14,440
reactor in the close syst situation you

977
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,240
have

978
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:22,119
U

979
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:24,920
Box uh the the application that I uh I

980
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:27,319
like to have in mind uh is the internal

981
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:31,280
combustion engine so you imagine that

982
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:34,440
this wall is the is the Piston of your

983
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,559
uh uh the cylinder of your um internal

984
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,559
combustion engine and uh so this wall

985
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:43,960
goes up and down and uh at the top dead

986
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,680
center it will be at a certain volume

987
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,319
okay and

988
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:53,480
suppose the Piston stops there for a

989
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:57,760
while okay so uh at that moment uh you

990
00:55:53,480 --> 00:56:02,799
have a mixture inside your um combuster

991
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:05,000
chamber which is a mixture of air and

992
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,000
your

993
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:12,119
fuel and some water vapor sometimes

994
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,839
because air air is humid so there is

995
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,839
water vapor content also at the

996
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,720
beginning of the combustion

997
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:21,520
process um it has some temperature some

998
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:24,440
pressure because the Piston has

999
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,960
compressed that mixture of course since

1000
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,079
we are in a stable equilibrium state it

1001
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,680
also has chemical

1002
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:33,520
potentials and if we want to compute the

1003
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,880
energy and the entropy because they will

1004
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,319
enter in the

1005
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,960
uh energy and entropy

1006
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,839
balances we know how to do it because we

1007
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,520
we've deal we've dealt with mixtures for

1008
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,520
a long time

1009
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,839
now so the energy in general is simply

1010
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,920
given well simply is given

1011
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:57,160
by uh the weighted sum weighted on the

1012
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,960
amount

1013
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:03,160
s of the partial

1014
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,359
properties and the partial properties

1015
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,599
depend on composition and we here we can

1016
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:12,960
apply all our theories about ideal

1017
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:16,400
mixtures or other models and so

1018
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,480
on and the same holds also for the other

1019
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,720
properties like entropy which is the

1020
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:26,480
other one that is needed for the entropy

1021
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:28,799
bance Okay now what's new here is that

1022
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:34,240
uh next

1023
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:38,440
you sort of turn on chemical

1024
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:42,880
reactions so the composition is allowed

1025
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:45,640
to change according to one or more uh

1026
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,880
chemical reaction

1027
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,880
mechanisms we will describe them um I'll

1028
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,119
go into detail of the of this

1029
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,240
description in the next slide but we

1030
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,119
will describe it by this General

1031
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,119
notation

1032
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:04,599
and what will happen is that um the

1033
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:06,119
process the the the fact that you turn

1034
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:09,920
on the possibility of the chemical

1035
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:13,559
reaction makes the the the the state

1036
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:17,559
evolve towards uh

1037
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,559
equilibrium and the composition will

1038
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:22,960
change so in the end you will have a

1039
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:26,160
composition that is different from the

1040
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:30,200
beginning so here you have the reactants

1041
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:34,960
so R stands for reactants here not for

1042
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,839
Reservoir and uh P stands for products

1043
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,480
see these are the products of combustion

1044
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:41,960
for example in which case you have a uh

1045
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,880
a

1046
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:47,400
air which you've consumed some of the

1047
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:52,000
oxygen

1048
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,880
um and then you have a carbon dioxide

1049
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,119
water

1050
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,119
vapor and maybe some and nitrogen

1051
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,079
oxide

1052
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,520
okay they will be because the reaction

1053
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,760
occurs

1054
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:13,520
irreversibly uh spontaneously there will

1055
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,280
be some entropy produced by

1056
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,200
reversibility you can compute once you

1057
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,640
have or at at least in terms of the

1058
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,079
final composition and the final

1059
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,720
temperature and

1060
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:28,039
pressure um you can compute the energy

1061
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,039
and the entropy the same way

1062
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:33,599
only of course relative to the new

1063
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:36,359
composition maybe the F not all the

1064
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:42,240
final things are

1065
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:43,799
known uh if you can uh use up only the

1066
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,599
energy and the entropy balance and

1067
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:48,960
perhaps also the volume balance if if

1068
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:51,559
you assume that this volume remains

1069
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,079
constant or relatively constant because

1070
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:57,000
that reaction at the top dead center uh

1071
00:59:55,079 --> 01:00:00,599
occurs very quick quickly and so the

1072
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,200
Piston doesn't move a lot uh then you

1073
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,280
have three equations energy entropy and

1074
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,200
volume balance with which you can solve

1075
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,720
for three

1076
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,599
unknowns so the various possible

1077
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,680
problems that can be solved are

1078
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:17,440
variations of this this

1079
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:21,160
thing and of

1080
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:25,359
course even though that is uh happens

1081
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:27,559
quickly maybe there is some U exchange

1082
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,760
of uh heat

1083
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:34,280
between your

1084
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:37,480
mixture uh and the walls of the

1085
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:39,720
container like the cylinder because the

1086
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:43,640
internal combustion engines are cooled

1087
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:46,559
water cooled or air cooled and so uh

1088
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:49,440
some of the energy can be exchanged with

1089
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:53,520
heat to the wall

1090
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:56,720
temperature and also the if the Piston

1091
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:59,680
is moving while this is happening there

1092
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,680
may also be some

1093
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:06,480
work due to the pressure times the

1094
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:10,039
volume uh

1095
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,640
change okay so that's the setup of the

1096
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:16,240
close system so internal combustion

1097
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:21,319
engine here instead is

1098
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:23,760
a steady state burner or reactor again

1099
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:27,440
if I have in mind a combustion of the

1100
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:33,359
hydrocarbons this is a State burner

1101
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:36,880
which is typically uh inside a power uh

1102
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:40,160
combustion fossil fuel power

1103
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:45,760
plant here the idea is that you have a

1104
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:47,920
flow bulk flow one if it's all the

1105
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:52,160
substances are premixed or maybe you

1106
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:54,599
have several if you have some of the um

1107
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:58,359
substances that are inject for example

1108
01:01:54,599 --> 01:02:01,200
air in you have a injection of air

1109
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:04,000
through one stream Al so one blf flow

1110
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:07,079
interaction and then uh your fuel

1111
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,720
injected in from another pipe that goes

1112
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:14,279
in so I indicate here a simple single

1113
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:18,079
Arrow but uh and but of course you you

1114
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:19,400
may have many the properties of for bulk

1115
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,960
flow

1116
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,760
interactions what what enters in the

1117
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,240
energy balance as you remember is the

1118
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:30,960
enthalpy

1119
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:35,599
and so we need the enthalpy the rate of

1120
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:38,960
enthalpy uh brought in uh by this uh

1121
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:42,839
Inlet uh bulk flow interaction which has

1122
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:45,039
to do with the partial

1123
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:48,200
enthalpies of the components in the

1124
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:51,480
mixtures for those that are mixed and

1125
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:55,520
that would be the specific if they are

1126
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,520
injected as pure components

1127
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:03,079
and the same for the

1128
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:05,079
outlet so the outlet here would be the

1129
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:07,319
hot product for example the hot products

1130
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,319
of

1131
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:13,680
combustion uh but in other

1132
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:19,000
configurations they could

1133
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:22,279
be uh if this reactor contains not only

1134
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,400
um just is not a diabatic but it

1135
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:28,039
contains also the machinery and the

1136
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,920
thermal cycle that extracts the energy

1137
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:33,400
and so on these would be just the

1138
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:38,200
products that gets that get exhausted at

1139
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,200
the chiminy or the stack of your power

1140
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:45,720
plant all

1141
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:47,599
right and so then u in that case we may

1142
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:52,799
have heat interactions and work

1143
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:54,680
interactions while while this uh complex

1144
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,960
uh uh

1145
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:59,480
[Music]

1146
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,960
power plant is evolving there is of

1147
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:06,359
course entropy produced by

1148
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:09,200
irreversibility and again the new aspect

1149
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:13,480
of that we need to deal with is the fact

1150
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:16,960
that inside here chemical reaction or

1151
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:22,039
chemical reactions can occur changing

1152
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:25,720
the composition from the inlet to the

1153
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:28,559
outlet the energy balance equation for a

1154
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:30,559
steady state says that the rate of

1155
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,119
change of the energy is zero because

1156
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,880
it's steady

1157
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:40,119
state and therefore uh that must be so

1158
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:43,319
the the rate at which the energies are

1159
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:45,839
exchanged in and out must balance to

1160
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:48,240
zero so the

1161
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:51,440
enthalpy uh of the

1162
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:56,440
inflow is a positive inaly of the

1163
01:04:51,440 --> 01:05:00,000
outflower and the uh heat uh flow

1164
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:02,799
positive if if if it has the arrow

1165
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,880
inside it means positive if

1166
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:09,480
received minus the work which is as the

1167
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:11,480
arrow outward and so it's positive if it

1168
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,279
is

1169
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,119
produced and similarly for the uh

1170
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:18,960
entropy

1171
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:21,079
balance the entropy the rate of change

1172
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,000
of the entropy of the reactor because we

1173
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:26,920
are making a balance equation for this

1174
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,559
reactor here

1175
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:33,359
uh if it is steady state the properties

1176
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:34,760
don't change so the rate of entropy

1177
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:39,839
change is

1178
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:43,720
zero and uh so then you have a balance

1179
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:46,520
between the net amount of entropy that

1180
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:50,680
uh comes

1181
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:53,119
uh in and out and the entropy that is

1182
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:57,119
produced by

1183
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,119
reversibility okay

1184
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:05,520
now if you look at these ones if you

1185
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:09,400
look at these equations uh and compare

1186
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:13,160
them you are often tempted

1187
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:16,760
to for example rewrite these ones with

1188
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:18,799
HP and minus HR on the left hand

1189
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,880
side which is

1190
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:26,079
okay just a legitimate mathematical

1191
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,799
step however

1192
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,799
you should be shouldn't be confused

1193
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:36,240
because otherwise say well why do I use

1194
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:39,559
enthalpy here why do I use energy there

1195
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:43,079
okay you're not using enthalpy here the

1196
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:45,720
same way it doesn't play the role of the

1197
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:49,480
energy the rate of energy change is this

1198
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:52,760
zero here that zero is important so if

1199
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:56,680
you if you do that mathematical step you

1200
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:59,480
sort of kill a zero that is important

1201
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:03,440
and giv you remind reminder that you're

1202
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:06,440
talking about steady state uh

1203
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,440
process

1204
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:14,079
okay how about

1205
01:07:09,799 --> 01:07:14,079
notation so let's take an

1206
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:21,000
example of the reaction in which you you

1207
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,000
have two

1208
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:29,359
hydrogen

1209
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:35,440
molecules this and that and an oxygen

1210
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:39,760
molecule and they get uh

1211
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:42,200
reassembled by this mechanism into two

1212
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,200
molecules of

1213
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,200
water

1214
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:53,880
okay

1215
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:57,119
so I use the equal sign

1216
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:59,440
here to say that this refers simply to

1217
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:02,000
the mechanism it doesn't say which

1218
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:06,039
direction uh it will

1219
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,799
go it simply defines the

1220
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:11,559
mechanism and therefore you can go in

1221
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:13,960
One Direction but also the

1222
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:16,640
opposite

1223
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:20,080
okay and there is therefore some

1224
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,560
arbitrary uh choice you could put on the

1225
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:25,120
left hand side hydrogen and oxygen or

1226
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,600
you could put on the left hand side the

1227
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:31,839
water

1228
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,839
the symbol for water it's either one is

1229
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:37,239
okay you can also once you have written

1230
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:40,719
that written it this way you can also

1231
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:43,719
put them all on the left hand

1232
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,719
side

1233
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:50,799
and with the stochiometric coefficients

1234
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:53,440
positive for what you will consider the

1235
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:55,199
products of the reaction and negative

1236
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,560
for those for those that you will

1237
01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:01,319
consider consider the

1238
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,319
uh the the

1239
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:09,799
reactant okay now the meaning of the

1240
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,560
stochiometric

1241
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:16,480
coefficients are that they

1242
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:19,040
determine the possible changes in

1243
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,640
composition so if I start with a

1244
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:26,880
composition which is given by these

1245
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:30,000
numbers any anything

1246
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:33,000
and then I want to see uh how the

1247
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,440
composition that composition can change

1248
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
according to this reaction mechanism and

1249
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,000
only this

1250
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:46,159
one then you can write these changes are

1251
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:50,400
not uh completely uh

1252
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:53,480
arbitrary because you have to have the

1253
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:56,040
fact that the the ratio of the change of

1254
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,920
one component to the to the

1255
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,120
respective stochiometric coefficient

1256
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:04,640
must be equal to the same ratio for all

1257
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:07,199
the other components so this ratio we're

1258
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,520
going to call the reaction coordinate or

1259
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:12,719
change in reaction coordinates that

1260
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,159
defines the reaction coordinates the the

1261
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,760
change over the stochiometric

1262
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,280
coefficient notice that this

1263
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:22,560
stochiometric coefficient must be

1264
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:25,520
taken with the sign the proper sign so

1265
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:28,719
negative for the reactant and positive

1266
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,719
for the uh

1267
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,360
products okay so with that in

1268
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,120
mind

1269
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:42,159
then in order to introduce a notation

1270
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:46,199
that also uh that is typically used

1271
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:49,560
in software that deals with

1272
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:53,880
calculations uh of chemical equilibrium

1273
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:56,000
or chemical kinetics

1274
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:59,880
uh we can

1275
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,760
Define a symbol a sub I a sub 1 a sub 2

1276
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,080
a

1277
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:09,239
sub3 uh to represent the the chemical

1278
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,239
symbols in the list so for

1279
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,520
example

1280
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,520
um we make we make a

1281
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:30,159
table one two three we decided to call

1282
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:33,520
uh the first component to make it H2 the

1283
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:34,679
second component is oxygen and the third

1284
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,760
is

1285
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:40,960
water okay so the stochiometric

1286
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,719
coefficient we use the symbol nuai for

1287
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,400
the stochiometric

1288
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:50,840
coefficient is

1289
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:55,880
min-2 for hydrogen minus one for oxygen

1290
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:55,880
and two for water

1291
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,000
and

1292
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:06,600
then you you see that this equation here

1293
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:09,880
that presents the chemical reaction

1294
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:13,840
mechanism translates into this summation

1295
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,840
which we we can write in the summation

1296
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,199
way the advantage of

1297
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:27,159
that is that so I have um

1298
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:35,840
this for my first reaction but suppose I

1299
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,960
have because in general uh life is not

1300
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,840
simple and uh very few things can be

1301
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,840
described with just a single chemical

1302
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:50,360
reaction for example even for that uh

1303
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,080
formation I mean water just for the

1304
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:55,239
combustion of

1305
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,040
hydrogen uh

1306
01:12:55,239 --> 01:13:00,120
I think that

1307
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:03,960
the the mechanism you have to consider

1308
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:07,760
at least uh forget now probably eight

1309
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:12,040
mechanisms and uh for the combustion of

1310
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:15,360
methane it's probably 250 or

1311
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,159
more that play a role uh and determine

1312
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,239
the

1313
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,760
kinetics different thing is for

1314
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,360
equilibrium but for the kinetics you

1315
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,360
need many

1316
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:28,440
mechanisms Okay so for example suppose

1317
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:31,159
we have also

1318
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,719
another

1319
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:36,280
important equation

1320
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:39,320
for

1321
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:43,280
for combustion which is the dissociation

1322
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,280
of CO2 in Co and

1323
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:52,920
oxygen uh if together with my uh initial

1324
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:56,400
reaction which is 2

1325
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:59,639
h2+ O2 =

1326
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:04,080
H2O which we already represented in our

1327
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:06,719
list if we also have that one we can

1328
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:11,600
keep going in the in

1329
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:14,719
our um list of of uh chemical species

1330
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:17,840
that are relevant to our

1331
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:21,159
problem we add CO2 and

1332
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,920
Co of course they don't play a role in

1333
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:24,679
the first reaction so we'll have

1334
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:28,840
psychometric coefficients for reaction

1335
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:30,960
One let's say this is reaction one so

1336
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,320
I'm putting a superscript one for the

1337
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,520
first

1338
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,520
reaction and

1339
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:45,280
then I put here the chemical

1340
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,080
uh sociometric coefficients for the

1341
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:51,639
second reaction so for the second

1342
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:56,440
reaction I have plus one since it's a

1343
01:14:51,639 --> 01:15:00,719
product for Co So Co is one

1344
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,719
oxygen 1 12

1345
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:09,360
so5 positive and CO2 it's it's on the

1346
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,960
left hand side so it's negative it's

1347
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:14,040
minus

1348
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:17,320
one of course the

1349
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,320
others are

1350
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:25,760
zero because in reaction one there is no

1351
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:30,360
play by CO2 and Co and in reaction two

1352
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,360
there's no play by water and

1353
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:40,000
hydrogen and so you see I have just put

1354
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:44,120
a j there and I have a system of as many

1355
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,120
chemical reactions as we

1356
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,520
want now the proportionality

1357
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:55,239
relations namely these relations here

1358
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:57,120
that uh represent the role of chemical

1359
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:59,960
um I mean sociometric coefficients in

1360
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:03,120
order to uh represent what compositions

1361
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:07,040
are changes in composition are possible

1362
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:12,639
are written this way or

1363
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:15,719
also in generic terms like Delta n over

1364
01:16:12,639 --> 01:16:17,639
new subi equals Delta Epsilon which

1365
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:20,280
which we

1366
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:25,920
can

1367
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:29,760
write uh more uh explicitly for example

1368
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:33,080
if we like in the previous uh uh

1369
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:36,159
examples with like in the batch process

1370
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:40,000
the composition goes to uh from the that

1371
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:43,360
of the reactants to that of uh the uh

1372
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,639
products so the change Delta n is equal

1373
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:50,280
to

1374
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:51,239
uh final minus initial so this is NP

1375
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:57,120
minus

1376
01:16:51,239 --> 01:17:00,400
NR is equal to U new sub Epsilon new new

1377
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:04,400
sorry new sub times

1378
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:06,159
Epsilon and this Epsilon here could

1379
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:10,560
be

1380
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:12,320
uh it's actually it's it's a Delta it's

1381
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,239
the difference between the value of the

1382
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,199
reaction coordinate that describes the

1383
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:21,360
products and the value of the reaction

1384
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:21,360
coordinate that describes the reactant

1385
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,300
composition if we have instead this

1386
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,520
steady state

1387
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,040
[Music]

1388
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:33,280
uh um flow

1389
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,840
uh continuous

1390
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:39,600
reaction then we talk about the rate of

1391
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:42,679
change of uh the composition so we take

1392
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:47,000
we Define we divide this by DT so Delta

1393
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:49,760
n by delta T is the stric coefficient

1394
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,639
times Delta EP delta T let's call it

1395
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,600
Epsilon

1396
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:57,159
Dot and so you you find that the rate

1397
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,960
that which the the difference between

1398
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:03,760
the rate at which the products and the

1399
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:05,639
reactants come out and in is related to

1400
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,800
this rate of change of the reaction

1401
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:13,960
coordinate which uh somehow is related

1402
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,960
to the uh reaction rate or

1403
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:24,000
rates in

1404
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:27,320
fact do I have it in the next slide no

1405
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,320
uh so in

1406
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,040
fact so we have n

1407
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,760
dot

1408
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:47,040
i

1409
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:49,840
p is equal to n do I

1410
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,920
plus uh okay so if you have only one

1411
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:55,239
reaction is uh the summation of uh

1412
01:18:53,920 --> 01:19:01,239
Epsilon Dot

1413
01:18:55,239 --> 01:19:01,239
times new I but if I have several

1414
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:09,400
reactions then each one has its own uh

1415
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:11,440
reaction coordinate and I have to sum

1416
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:14,199
up the

1417
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:17,960
contribution uh to the change of the

1418
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:17,960
various reactions in

1419
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,800
play

1420
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,719
okay so now let's let's go back sorry

1421
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:32,679
let's go back here to the

1422
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:34,960
structure of the balance

1423
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:37,840
equations in the balance

1424
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:41,000
equations you have we have to deal with

1425
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:43,000
differen between the energy between

1426
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,639
products and reactants the entropy

1427
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,480
between products and reactants also here

1428
01:19:45,639 --> 01:19:54,360
the enthalpy between reactants and

1429
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:54,360
products the entropy these differences

1430
01:19:55,639 --> 01:20:05,159
yes it is true that uh we can um write

1431
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:08,600
them we know how to write them except

1432
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:11,480
that we have to learn a proper way to

1433
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:14,199
deal with the fact that uh the

1434
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:16,520
composition is changing here so some

1435
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:19,239
molecules are disappearing and some are

1436
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:21,520
appearing uh that have different

1437
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:26,239
properties and therefore we have to be

1438
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:27,440
careful in how we take uh

1439
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,639
reference

1440
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:32,920
value for these

1441
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:37,239
properties and this is done

1442
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:41,000
here for example U of those differences

1443
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:43,480
let's take uh one which is the

1444
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,040
energy so we write the

1445
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:50,760
energy difference between products and

1446
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:53,440
reactants as uh as we said okay so this

1447
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,679
is just the implementation of what we

1448
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:57,760
said

1449
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,440
in terms of partial

1450
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:04,760
properties

1451
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:07,040
now we let's add and

1452
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:10,400
subtract something which will not change

1453
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:12,080
therefore the result and which we select

1454
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:17,080
to added

1455
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:17,080
subtract for each um

1456
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:22,800
constituent the specific property of

1457
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:25,920
pure component of that constituent at

1458
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,600
some reference and here let's say at

1459
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:32,719
some reference temperature and

1460
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:35,360
pressure I'm going to call the pressure

1461
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,639
p not because typically it's taken the

1462
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:40,360
standard pressure is the one

1463
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:42,960
atmosphere whereas here for temperature

1464
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:45,639
let's use the generic temperature for

1465
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:50,760
the moment if it will

1466
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:53,719
be the the standard temperature to to

1467
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,280
298.15 that we we will denote it by T

1468
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:57,280
not

1469
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:00,040
but for the moment this can be done at

1470
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:07,480
any temperature and this temperature is

1471
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:10,920
not necessarily equal to either TR or

1472
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:14,360
TP okay so we add and subtract so here

1473
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:16,880
is here it is so we uh we subtract from

1474
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:19,000
from this summation we subtract from

1475
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,600
that

1476
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,840
summation but then we realize that since

1477
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:27,120
we put it in this summation here it is

1478
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:31,400
um multiplied by

1479
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:32,560
NP and here it is multiplied by NR so we

1480
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:36,000
have

1481
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:38,360
to add up

1482
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,560
uh what we

1483
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:44,360
subtracted so

1484
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:47,000
this multiplied by the corresponding

1485
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:49,600
amounts

1486
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:53,159
here so in this summation that

1487
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:55,800
compensates for those subtractions is we

1488
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:59,120
we we recognize

1489
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:01,080
uh the difference between composition in

1490
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:03,040
between products and reactants and

1491
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:05,760
that's related to

1492
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:09,960
the uh reaction

1493
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,960
coordinate through the proportionality

1494
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:16,480
relations so the Epsilon doesn't have a

1495
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,480
subscr it goes out of the

1496
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,520
summation and here we are left with the

1497
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:22,960
summation of the stochiometric

1498
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:26,120
coefficients which multiply this

1499
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,880
reference with with the

1500
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:30,760
pure component

1501
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:33,480
properties uh specific properties at

1502
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,880
those reference temperature and

1503
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:38,120
pressure

1504
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:41,840
this

1505
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:45,000
summation we call it the energy of the

1506
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,880
reaction at standard pressure and at

1507
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,080
that temperature and we denote it by

1508
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,520
this symbol here so that defines the

1509
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,880
energy of the

1510
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:58,520
reaction you can do that for for all the

1511
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,239
other uh for all the other um differen

1512
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:03,520
here for example this is for the

1513
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,520
enthalpy the rate of

1514
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:11,960
enthalpies add and

1515
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:15,040
subtract uh the pure component specific

1516
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:18,639
enthalpy you get

1517
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:20,199
uh in this final term you get the

1518
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,440
proportionality relation for the

1519
01:24:20,199 --> 01:24:26,159
continuous process Epsilon dot goes out

1520
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:31,800
of the summation the summ you also call

1521
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:35,000
it the enthalpy of the reaction uh at it

1522
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,320
is the enthalpy of the reaction because

1523
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,400
uh it has in it refers to a specific

1524
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:42,119
reaction because it depends on the

1525
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:44,920
stochiometric co efficients of that

1526
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:47,159
reaction okay so I'll have an enthalpy

1527
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:50,840
of this reaction another enthalpy for

1528
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:54,400
that reaction so each reaction has its

1529
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:56,600
own value for these properties of

1530
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,920
reaction we call them properties of

1531
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:02,880
reaction and here's the list you can do

1532
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:06,159
that for for all properties including

1533
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,320
energy entropy enpy gives fre energy and

1534
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:11,400
even

1535
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:15,800
volume and of course since they these

1536
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:18,400
are uh pure component uh uh

1537
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:21,800
properties

1538
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:24,960
um the relation that hold

1539
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:29,040
between properties also hold

1540
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:31,119
between uh the properties of reaction so

1541
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:34,880
since the Gibs free energy you can write

1542
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:37,040
it as H minus TS it turns out that the

1543
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,679
GI free energy of reaction is equal to

1544
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:43,679
the enthalpy of reactions minus t times

1545
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:47,960
the entropy of

1546
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:53,600
reaction or since the enthalpy uh is

1547
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:55,080
equal to energy plus PV U plus PV there

1548
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,119
there is a relation also between the

1549
01:25:55,080 --> 01:26:01,600
enthalpy of reaction the energy of

1550
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:01,600
reaction and the uh volume of

1551
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:08,440
reaction this is for a generic

1552
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:11,560
temperature T at standard temperature

1553
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:16,000
pressure also the temperature is fixed

1554
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:19,119
we we drop the symbol uh function of T

1555
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,440
and for for Simplicity we just uh by

1556
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:25,199
convention say well if if there is

1557
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:30,800
no dependence of of t means that we are

1558
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:34,639
at at T not so the KN here is uh has two

1559
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:37,600
meaning uh pressure and also temperature

1560
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,600
are at standard

1561
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:44,199
values now it turns out that if you want

1562
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:47,400
to uh

1563
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:51,600
compute the properties

1564
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:54,960
of reaction you see as we've said every

1565
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:59,480
reaction has its own properties

1566
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:02,639
should then be uh all uh measured so if

1567
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:05,280
you have one

1568
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:08,520
uh interesting in one reaction you have

1569
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:10,800
to find the experimental values of

1570
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:13,000
somebody who measured these the

1571
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,840
properties for your reaction well the

1572
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,840
answer is no

1573
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:20,520
fortunately because of the EST relation

1574
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:24,719
which we will prove in a

1575
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:27,159
moment uh whereby you you

1576
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,400
it turns out that uh there is a minimal

1577
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:34,760
set of uh measurements that you have to

1578
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:36,679
make which is um the measurement of the

1579
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:40,400
reactions of formations of the various

1580
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:42,639
component once you have those uh using

1581
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:47,400
these relations H

1582
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:50,560
relations uh you can find the

1583
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:53,719
um properties of reaction for any

1584
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:55,840
reaction by just taking the weighted sum

1585
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:57,440
with the

1586
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,320
stochiometric coefficients of your

1587
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:04,040
reaction of the reactions of formations

1588
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:08,199
of the various uh of the various

1589
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:08,199
molecules that play in your

1590
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:15,840
reaction so essentially

1591
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:18,840
here I'm interested in

1592
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,840
energy

1593
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:29,000
uh symbol yeah okay the F goes before f

1594
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:32,360
i not and then I'll have to list

1595
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,199
somewhere here the values of the en

1596
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,800
energies of formation for these various

1597
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:38,679
components and these ones I find

1598
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:41,679
tabulated in the handbooks of

1599
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:41,679
chemical

1600
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:48,360
physics now before before we prove this

1601
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:51,159
relation let's

1602
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:54,840
U uh

1603
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:57,400
see the meaning of this Delta

1604
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,400
U and

1605
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:02,760
Delta actually this is for enthalpy and

1606
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,920
entropy and so let's consider one

1607
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:12,199
particular reaction like that of in

1608
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:15,159
which hydrogen molecule splits into uh

1609
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:15,159
two hydrogen

1610
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:30,560
atoms so here I'm drying I'm drawing the

1611
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:34,159
uh eus s or actually the enal versus S

1612
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:38,760
curve for the stable equilibrium

1613
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:41,320
states of atomic hydrogen this is atomic

1614
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:44,000
hydrogen in the amount of one fixed

1615
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:49,400
fixed amount one

1616
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:54,639
mole and at standard pressure one

1617
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:54,639
atmosphere this other curve represents

1618
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,960
half a

1619
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,000
mole

1620
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:06,440
of molecular hydrogen

1621
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,440
H2 also at standard

1622
01:30:08,119 --> 01:30:15,679
pressure then I take a

1623
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,639
slope equal to

1624
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:20,400
2

1625
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:23,719
985

1626
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:25,080
Kelvin and search for the point on this

1627
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:27,679
curve

1628
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:29,920
what I have that temperature turns out

1629
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:34,360
the derivative of the of H with respect

1630
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:37,199
to S constant p is uh equal to the

1631
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:40,199
temperature so also on this diagram uh

1632
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:40,199
the slope is the

1633
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:47,840
temperature and here I find it

1634
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:50,280
here and for this other substance I find

1635
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,280
it

1636
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:59,960
there now these two curves

1637
01:30:55,239 --> 01:31:04,560
uh until uh yesterday

1638
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,560
or until we didn't consider chemical

1639
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:13,320
reactions we're sort of

1640
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:16,280
independent if we needed to describe the

1641
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:20,639
properties of this molecule we just draw

1642
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:25,480
this curve anywhere taking an

1643
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:29,280
arbitrary zero for the enthalpy I didn't

1644
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:32,520
matter but now instead what matters is

1645
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:35,280
the fact that you with a chemical

1646
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:37,679
reaction mechanism you can go from one

1647
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:42,000
substance to the

1648
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:44,320
other so they the you cannot arbitrarily

1649
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,760
choose reference values for the

1650
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,760
properties uh for

1651
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,600
both because

1652
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:02,280
for example if you look at um suppose we

1653
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,280
were at zero

1654
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,840
temperature

1655
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:12,320
uh in order

1656
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:17,960
to

1657
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:21,280
split uh this molecule of atomic I mean

1658
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:25,480
molecular hydrogen into two hydrogen you

1659
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:28,440
have to break a bond chemical Bond and

1660
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:32,159
the strength of this chemical

1661
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:35,760
bond corresponds to an energy that you

1662
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:39,360
have to provide in order to uh

1663
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,920
detach these two atoms that compose the

1664
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:45,199
the

1665
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:49,280
molecule this energy this bond

1666
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:52,719
energy is what you have to plot here so

1667
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:55,760
that is is uh the the number that allows

1668
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,960
you to place in relative position the

1669
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:01,480
two

1670
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:03,800
curves because this value you

1671
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:06,360
measure uh and

1672
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:08,480
therefore these two curves must be at

1673
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:12,360
this distance

1674
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,560
here then using the properties of the

1675
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:17,520
the substances of the pure substances

1676
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:19,880
here you can compute like using specific

1677
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,560
ke and so on you can compute what would

1678
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:24,320
be the value of the enthalpy at this

1679
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,760
temperature

1680
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:30,480
and then also using the specific Heats

1681
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:33,040
of this other substance you can uh

1682
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:36,000
integrate the equation this

1683
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:39,400
the the fundamental relation and get to

1684
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,520
this point okay these are correspond to

1685
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:43,480
the standard the

1686
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:47,080
conditions

1687
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:51,400
and the enthalpy of

1688
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:56,679
formation of uh Atomic hydrogen so of of

1689
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:59,719
this state here uh from from molecular

1690
01:33:56,679 --> 01:34:03,000
hydrogen is is given by the difference

1691
01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:06,440
in the inal between here and there this

1692
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,360
is the amount of energy that you have to

1693
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:13,960
provide in a steady state

1694
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:17,760
reactor uh where as input you have

1695
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:19,480
hydrogen at standard conditions and as

1696
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:25,719
output you have

1697
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:25,719
a atomic hydrogen at also standard

1698
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:39,719
conditions all right

1699
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:42,560
and this also there is a difference in

1700
01:34:39,719 --> 01:34:48,280
entropy this difference in entropy

1701
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:48,280
corresponds to the entropy of uh

1702
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:54,920
formation okay

1703
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:05,560
now

1704
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:09,000
this the strength of the bondes we will

1705
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:12,560
return on this graph but just to the

1706
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:19,040
strength of the of the bonds

1707
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:21,920
um is uh also um describable

1708
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:24,239
using for example Leonard Jones's

1709
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,880
potential

1710
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:29,440
but the strength and the distances in

1711
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,719
play are very

1712
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,719
different for

1713
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:39,159
example this would

1714
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:42,719
be uh the Leonard Jones potential that

1715
01:35:39,159 --> 01:35:46,280
describes the calent

1716
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:48,840
bond uh which is what happens when um

1717
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,840
this

1718
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:54,400
um hydrogen atom gets close to the

1719
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:59,159
oxygen

1720
01:35:54,400 --> 01:36:01,760
and U gets to share

1721
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:06,159
U they get to share two

1722
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:10,960
electrons and these two electrons form a

1723
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:16,040
a negative charge enough

1724
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:18,800
to to cover up the repulsion between the

1725
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:21,719
positive charges of the

1726
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:25,000
nuclei okay so then this this is the

1727
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:30,719
repulsion of the nuclear this is the

1728
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:36,119
attraction and this is a very heavy um

1729
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:38,560
dip it is 459 KJ per

1730
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:43,400
mole if you compare it with the Vander

1731
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:45,840
vales forces between uh um that that are

1732
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:47,280
that you can calculate for water

1733
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,800
molecules

1734
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:52,239
in that describes the liquid and Vapor

1735
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:56,280
phase for water molecules using the

1736
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:59,199
lonard John's uh fluid model that we

1737
01:36:56,280 --> 01:37:04,639
discussed the value of the

1738
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:04,639
Epsilon is uh you see

1739
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:12,000
it's what is it 4,000 times smaller

1740
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:16,520
5,000 time times

1741
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,440
smaller so much that in order to show it

1742
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:20,679
in the plot I have to multiply it here

1743
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:25,320
by a factor of a

1744
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:26,880
thousand and still it's smaller and also

1745
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:31,000
the minimum

1746
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,639
here for the Vander vales forces the

1747
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,679
attraction between

1748
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:37,679
molecules uh which are also of

1749
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:41,480
electrostatic nature but of from

1750
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:44,280
different source is

1751
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:48,360
uh makes

1752
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:52,239
the has very larger much larger

1753
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:58,280
characteristic uh distances so it's like

1754
01:37:52,239 --> 01:38:01,719
uh uh three angstrom here or or 300

1755
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:04,239
picometers here and instead for the

1756
01:38:01,719 --> 01:38:08,159
calent bond is of the order of

1757
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:12,159
74 so they have to get much closer in

1758
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:16,480
order to in order for these um much

1759
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:20,000
stronger forces to to to get in play and

1760
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:24,159
hold the molecule so this is

1761
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,679
a to to say that uh

1762
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:29,520
um yes you can use Leonard Jones

1763
01:38:26,679 --> 01:38:34,480
although it's not really a great model

1764
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:38,000
for for this kind of of bonds but it it

1765
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:40,880
gives you the first order

1766
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,239
uh idea and

1767
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:46,560
but you have to realize also of the

1768
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:49,320
different order of magnitude of the

1769
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,920
strengths of the bonds with respect to

1770
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:56,760
the V vales

1771
01:38:50,920 --> 01:39:00,119
forces okay so yeah let's stop here I

1772
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,119
guess yeah
