1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:17,680
well now that we've all turned in our

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,439
proposals for repertories for uh for the

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,519
second problem set I want to go through

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,800
some of the problems that arise even in

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,560
uh Western notation and even in

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,560
classical music that raise interesting

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,920
questions for representation so we're

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,360
looking at a Piano Trio this by clar

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,000
Schuman and it might look like there's

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,600
not too many problems to represent but

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,800
we'll get back to it a little bit and

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,760
look a little bit deeper here's a little

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,120
piece from Don Giovani by Mozart and you

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,480
can see it's not a highquality scan but

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,559
there's still uh interesting things here

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,440
this is not actually Don Giovani this is

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,760
a piano reduction so we have the singer

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:02,359
Donna alira and all the orchestra

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,000
reduced to two staves here is uh the

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,799
similar uh passage the same passage

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,840
actually with uh different language we

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,280
have Italian and English before and now

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,680
Italian and German but where we have the

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,119
full orchestral score out and how do we

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,799
represent the differences and the

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,960
connections between these two

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,759
scores this is already a difficult

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,920
problem that hasn't been fully solved

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,320
but wait till we try to represent oh how

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,439
do the manuscript parts for various

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,040
pieces uh

32
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,040
relate when we go into the 20th century

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,360
and 21st centuries there are even more

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,360
complex problems this is a late score by

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,560
osinsky which is actually pretty uh

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,040
standard in many ways in that uh it uses

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,920
notes and things but the um the clefts

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,680
if they continue into the next staff

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,640
they're continued with lines and

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,000
probably most obviously when an

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,439
instrument doesn't play its part is it's

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,520
staff is

43
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,560
removed or something like this this is

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,959
from one of my scores when I was in

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,239
college where the stabs staves are

46
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,599
removed where people don't play but also

47
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,680
at various points the representation the

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,800
distances between notes are not given

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,440
with standard note heads but are given

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,879
with uh with time durations and some of

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,280
the some of the notes such as the these

52
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,040
here that are accelerating aren't given

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,080
in ex exact uh they're they're not given

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,360
exactly between a quarter an eighth note

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,400
or 64th note but some Continuum in

56
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,480
between a lot of the greatest music

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,120
being written today such as this piece

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,239
by Kate soer uh uses extended um

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,879
notational techniques so here we have

60
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,319
filled in circles representing uh closed

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,480
mouth and we have open mouth signal

62
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,440
signals and we have uh symbols for pure

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,519
speech and the violin part you might see

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,799
actually uh isn't in trouble cluff but

65
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,799
it's in percussion cluff with four lines

66
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,640
each one representing just to play on

67
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,959
that string these are the notes these

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,720
are the strings to be playing

69
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,080
on there are many pieces such as this

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,080
piece by Brian fer how

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:30,080
AAL that that require us to have

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,519
notational formats that uh that go again

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,519
beyond what we might think of as com

74
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,360
common notation but only push it a

75
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,159
little bit further such as uh early on

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,439
here we have a triplet in the place of

77
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,239
21 over 20 in the place of 74 or at the

78
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,840
end we have a measure whose time

79
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,640
signature denominator is not a power of

80
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,519
two how do we represent such

81
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,280
things we don't have to get into 20th

82
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,799
and 21st Century Music to run into

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,799
problems like this here is another path

84
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,000
message from Mozart D Giovani where

85
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,640
there are three different orchestras

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,799
playing on stage and in the pit and they

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,200
are in three different time signatures

88
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,359
representing the different classes of

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,880
people whose dances would be represented

90
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,040
in different tempos in 38 24 and

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,600
34 measures do not necessarily line up

92
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,759
how do we even count measures in

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,080
something like

94
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,000
this in other wise seemingly normal

95
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,199
passage by DBC we have this moment and I

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,600
thank Donald bird for pointing this out

97
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,919
where we actually have two different CS

98
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,919
active simultaneously on the same staff

99
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,080
how does this get

100
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,680
represented if we go back to the clar

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,039
shiman example with which we began we

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,720
can see that there are actually certain

103
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:59,160
things that are extremely difficult to

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,479
represent why is this rest here but

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,320
there's no rests before what part of the

106
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,560
measure does this mean well it's kind of

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,080
obvious this voice is moving up to here

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,919
but how is that obvious for a computer

109
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,600
or what parts exactly are these notes

110
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,759
that cross staves part of um how do we

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,840
represent cross staff beaming how do we

112
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,360
represent some of these U the time that

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,759
would actually be used in a Grace

114
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,120
note and when we go earlier in time

115
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,240
there are problems that expand even

116
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,120
further this is a only a little bit

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,400
different from common western music

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,919
notation in this uh example from I

119
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,759
believe the 16 no from the 17th century

120
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:49,600
um of church music but we are using

121
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,560
different symbols for for different

122
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,400
notes and not not having leaving out one

123
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,840
layer of the open

124
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,120
Notes when we go very far back in time

125
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,759
uh such as in this I believe 9th century

126
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,599
uh chant manuscript from the opening of

127
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,199
the mass for Christmas uh we have

128
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:14,319
symbols that just tell us the direction

129
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,560
that notes go not their exact pitch do

130
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,840
we want to be able to encode things such

131
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,680
as

132
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,280
this here is a beautiful manuscript from

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,479
the beginning of the 15th century in the

134
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,240
shape of a heart because the composer's

135
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,240
name b cordier core means heart and do

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,080
we want to represent the graphical

137
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,160
layout of the original score let alone

138
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,599
these notes that are in uh red or other

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,400
uh unusual

140
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:48,960
formats and here's another example from

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,160
the same time period where the harps

142
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,360
strings become the staff lines but the

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,160
notes only appear on the staff lines

144
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,840
therefore all of the notation is sort of

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,879
expanded into double

146
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,759
size what we want to do with this what

147
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,520
do we want to do with a piece such as

148
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,639
Cornelius cardu Trea where notational

149
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,759
symbols are used to give inspiration to

150
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,400
the performers to the singers and how to

151
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,919
perform this there is a score but every

152
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,800
performance is

153
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,879
different here is another score for Earl

154
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,240
Brown folio from December of

155
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,199
1952 how do we interpret this how do we

156
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,599
store the interpretations of this piece

157
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,080
I already mentioned in class that

158
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,720
non-western music and popular

159
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,319
music have their own difficulties as

160
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,639
well have their own problems and

161
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,759
interesting points as does Machine music

162
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,919
electronic music or in this case a piano

163
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,759
player role where exact precise

164
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,639
differences distances between notes can

165
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,080
be encoded so I hope that this gives

166
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,080
some sense of some of the rich variety

167
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,800
of representation and I'm looking

168
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,919
forward to seeing how your

169
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,919
representations end up
