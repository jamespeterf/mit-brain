Hi, my name is Ally Bowman and I work

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,200
here in the admissions office at MIT

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,679
Sloan.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,759
The MIT Sloan Min program was launched

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,920
in 2008 at the height of the financial

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,680
crisis. The program was designed to

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,760
empower the future leaders of the

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,240
finance field in a time that we really

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,160
needed strong leaders. If you enter the

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
MININ program, you will be able to learn

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,880
from faculty that are at the height of

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,480
the finance field. They are experienced

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,920
and knowledgeable and they are looking

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,719
to share that knowledge with you.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,120
The EMP program is geared towards early

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,200
career professionals. We are looking for

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,440
candidates that are knowledgeable about

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,840
and passionate about a career in

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440
finance. That being said, you don't have

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,120
to have a professional background in

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,680
finance in order to be eligible for the

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
program. Um again while passion and

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,680
knowledge about finance field is um

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,039
beneficial you don't have to have

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,399
professional work or internship

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,559
experience in order to be eligible for

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,559
the Emp

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,520
GMAT or GRE scores are optional.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
However, we do strongly encourage

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
students to include their scores if they

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,680
have them. The more data that we can

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
know about you, the better. And so if

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,640
you do have those test scores, we

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,960
strongly encourage you to include that

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,960
on the application.
