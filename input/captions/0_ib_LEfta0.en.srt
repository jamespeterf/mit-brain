1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,600
so we are really very pleased to be able

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,439
to offer the opportunity for you to get

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,920
to hear from three of our most recent um

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,599
graduates of the enin program um I'm

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,160
going to have them actually do quick

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,920
introductions in a minute but I do want

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,680
to um just say that we recognize that

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,000
this is an investment for you and while

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,599
your primary focus is going to be on the

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,240
academics and learning the technical SK

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,640
skills that you need both in terms of

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,320
you know the deeper quantitative Finance

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,040
as well as just understanding how

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,640
markets behave modern finance that after

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,079
all was um basically started here at MIT

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
um these are important Concepts and so

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,000
while we know that that's a a big Focus

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,680
the reality is that the program and

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,399
again it's primarily designed to be

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,199
delivered in 18 months with an

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,920
opportunity to FastTrack in 12 months

22
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,000
that time period goes by so so quickly

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,039
I'm sure my alums will attest to that

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
and as soon as you start it's a summer

25
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,280
term so we start July 1st it's in person

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,119
fully residential there's a lot that you

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
have to cover in the in the whether it's

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,040
12 or 18 months and while you're doing

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,680
all of your cours work you're then

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,560
jumping right into um recruiting

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,240
essentially looking at what your options

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,640
are going to be if you're in the 18month

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,280
of Summer internship um or if you're in

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,880
the 12 month full-time opportunities so

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
you really do have to hit the ground

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,320
running um and it's important to be

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,720
prepared and thinking about that even

38
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,119
before you arrive to MIT what are some

39
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,920
of the you know career um or banking or

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,960
Finance functions that you think you're

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,079
more interested in and when you look at

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,680
the employment reports you know you can

43
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,880
see that we have students who

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,680
quantitative Finance as well as more

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,240
traditional I Banking and as it turns

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,960
out our alums that we have today for the

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,560
most part are in on on the lad but um I

48
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,920
think it's important to get a sense from

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,119
them of how they were able to best

50
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,600
utilize the resources that are available

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,719
to them both from the CDO as well as

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,159
just other things that they may have

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,280
done on their own I'm going to ask Emily

54
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,200
if you want to kick things off and

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,119
introduce yourself tell us where where

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,400
you were before you came to the mfin

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,120
program graduated did you have a

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,840
particular focus when you were in the

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,239
mfin program maybe you did a

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,200
concentration or if not that's fine and

61
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,560
then what you're doing now yeah of

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,120

internship opportunities and experiences

69

um at Ming I completed my Corporate

70
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,959
Finance certificate with um I guess my

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,360
focus would more so be on the corporate

72
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,840
finance banking site instead of PA as uh

73
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,640
Laura and Diane previously mentioned I'm

74
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,280

which is in Boutique Investment Bank

76
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,440
specializing in power energy and

77
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,400
infrastructure I joined here around six

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,360
six months ago time

79
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,920

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,599
good though um Arjun I'm GNA have you go

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,519
next yeah absolutely uh so I graduated

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,480
from UCLA after which I worked for a

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
couple of years so I worked at ernston

audit private equities and hedge funds

89
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,640
and I really loved the way they they

90
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,840
valued their positions and I realized

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
that I need some more experience in uh

92
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,239
in that line so I came into the infant

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,760

Texas um I actually came into the infant

104
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,439
program thinking I wanted to do more of

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,040
a quantitative role and uh ended up

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,959

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,599

infrastructure team excellent thank you

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,959
so much so um Laura did you want to go

112
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,519
ahead and ask some more questions I know

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,519
you had a few that you teed up through

114
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,359
our Lums but we want to also keep this

115
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,000
as you know a little bit more informal a

116
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,400
little bit more loose let them talk a

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,440
little bit about you know some of their

118
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,120
experiences too um so I'll I'll give you

119
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,160
let's say a softball and just want to

120
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,840
know how did the m program prepare you

121
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,560
for launching your careers George you

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,120
want to go first I mean I guess I can

123
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,120
you already knew um the uh I honestly um

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,120
I know that the panel as Dian was saying

125
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,800
is largely in the corporate finance side

126
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,120
but I think the overall breadth of the

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,160
program allows you to take extremely

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,880
quantitative uh uh courses as well all

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,840
the way from uh you know in the

130
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,960
mathematics Department to any other uh

131
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,639
courses you can take you know at Sloan

132
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,120
as well at through cross registering at

133
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,360
different schools within the Boston area

134
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,960
so any kind of uh curriculum that you

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,600
kind of want to set for yourself I think

136
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,199
is uh will ultimately prepare you to at

137
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,919
the highest level of degree that you

138
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,880
could really go um I think it's a lot of

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,199
the invins that come out whether that is

140
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,919
on a trading or Quant research or a i

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,600
banking role does uh it is pretty

142
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,240
astounding how well uh they teach you uh

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,880
in the infant program I uh I sometimes

144
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,680
think I wish I did my undergrad in the

145
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,520
infant program too and you know just

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,280
stay there for four years but uh you

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,960
know it's a it's a tough one sure I can

148
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,800
go next yeah I mean like George said

149
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,520
just seconding that an incredible

150
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,880
experience learning so much from people

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,160
like yourself as well and yeah but I

152
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,919
would say that if I were to pick

153
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,160
something that was very particular it

154
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,639
was the Futures and options class

155
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,639
because that really taught me depth into

156
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,720
financial instruments and I use that on

157
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,319
on a day-to-day basis today at my job

158
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,199
and I wouldn't have been able to do that

159
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,280
had I not done the infant program like

160
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,120
learning nuances of different financial

161
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,440
instruments yeah I think I think sorry I

162
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,759
think adding on to that it's I

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,000
definitely agree that there's like a

164
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,199
Quant portion of like the the curriculum

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,800
like the python requirement and

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,319
everything but for someone like me that

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,000
has like a corporate finance or like a

168
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,360
banking perspective there are like some

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,039
valuable coures that I've taken um sort

170
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,000
of like like Paving my way basically to

171
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,960
like banking or like valuation or like

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,479
how like the indry will look like so

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,919
that's definitely something that's also

174
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,919
like a balance between like the Quant

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,479
side and also uh the corporate side of

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,319
like banking or

177
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,440
Finance so I I spoke briefly to how

178
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,560
career is everywhere at MIT and you're

179
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,599
touching upon some of the courses um can

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,520
you think too maybe about a networking

181
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,759
event another class or faculty member

182
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,960
action learning was there something that

183
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
really impacted you and you feel that it

184
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,199
contributed to your career your growth

185
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,080
as a student and to where you are today

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,080
love to hear about what comes to

187
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:17,080
mind um oh think oh

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm ladies first oh sorry George um I I

189
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,639
was gonna mention um I remember like the

190
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,160
M thing networking I um that was

191
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,280
definitely one of the top hits in my

192
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,160
mind because we our firm actually just

193
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,120
went there it was I think the past

194
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,400
Tuesday um that's where I met my current

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,199
firm and they you know they um come down

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,919
to come up to like Boston and they like

197
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,039
I network with them I talk to them

198
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,000
that's like one of the great ways to

199
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,240
know some of like the firms that aren't

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,319
really necessarily post like their job

201
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,599
postings anywhere um like I know that

202
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,280
our firm didn't really post a lot of

203
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,360
openings online but they would offer to

204
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,720
like M students because um MIT or M

205
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,960
program is one of our

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,440
targets um another thing um in terms

207
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,919
like courses I'll probably flag the um

208
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,159
Pro seminar classes that we have at MIT

209
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,560
I took the investment banking Pro

210
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,560
seminar

211
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:12,240
with um and it was a very exciting

212
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,000
Journey we partnered with one of the

213
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,560
investment Banks gox to do one of the

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
projects that's where I definitely

215
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,280
learned and gained some like real

216
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
hands-on experience by like doing the

217
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,479
modeling the process um and

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,159
talk to them um or like whoever is

219
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,319
really working the industry every week

220
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,319
so that's definitely one of the most Val

221
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,760
thank you George arjent is there

222
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,399
something that comes to mind that really

223
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,919
impacted you during the program for your

224
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:45,480
career growth oh yeah um absolutely the

225
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,200
the networking night was wonderful and I

226
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,000
think for me personally it was meeting

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
the professors and getting a perspective

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,839
from them about like what exists in the

229
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,519
market because prior to coming in MIT I

230
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,279
didn't even know a role like Stout

231
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,279
exists and a professor really educated

232
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,640
me about this because I'd come in from a

233
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,440
Consulting background where I loved

234
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,279
advising clients but I wanted to know

235
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,279
more about finance and specializing onto

236
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,519
like financial instruments and doing

237
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,120
more work like that and that's something

238
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,360
that yeah I got to know about that field

239
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,399
to begin with and then she was kind

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,079
enough to introduce me to a a person

241
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,440
who's a director of my current firm and

242
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:20,800
that's how I was able to like land this

243
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,800
role so yeah very grateful and that

244
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,399
yeah I think uh just one more to take

245
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,120
home would be the the overall SL

246
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,959
Community it's know it's extremely

247
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,760
divers

248
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,320
and everyone is extremely collaborative

249
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,000
as well so especially if you know if

250
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,480

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,040
these except these are people at all the

260
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,560
different stages throughout their career

261
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,240
that are going to be you know in some of

262
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,079
these classes with you they're going to

263
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,360
be uh you know grabbing coffee next to

264
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,120
you and the ultimate uh ability to just

265
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
kind of ask questions to these

266
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,160
individuals that have you know built an

267
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,519
entire career in you know Quant trading

268
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:22,240
or you know have built a firm in the

269
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,320
early stage VC like I think that uh that

270
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,240
is a tremendous opportunity for uh

271
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,760
getting a level of insight that you

272
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,839
really can't get anywhere else other

273
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,079
than Sloan

274
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,959
you know especially at just before you

275
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
know coming out of your undergrad and I

276
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,399
you understand too if you're further

277
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,480
into your career as well I think there's

278
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,440
plenty of opportunity to collaborate

279
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,720
with them as

280
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,040
well you've each talked about in a way

281
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
how you learned about opportunities that

282
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,440
you didn't know existed until you came

283
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,600
in the program or you discovered your

284
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,839
opportunity through an event from the

285
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,040
program or you transitioned what your

286
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,240
original goals were you went through the

287
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:07,279
program can you speak to how those

288
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,160
resources um impacted you and how you

289
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,720
were supported in making those

290
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,320
Transitions and experiencing that growth

291
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,560
you know how how do you feel that you've

292
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,279
benefited professionally from that

293
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,279
growth and those resources in the

294
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,560
program I I'll throw it back in um I

295
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,839
think it terms uh I think multiple

296
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,480
avenues that were extremely helpful for

297
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
my group uh growth personally whether

298
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,120
that's you know I think is talked about

299
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,480
the action learning Labs uh you're you

300
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,120
get to work with um you know these these

301
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,160
you know amazing companies and you're

302
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,720
going to their offices and meeting with

303
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,120
them and actually being able to solve

304
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,120
you know real problems and they're

305
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,800
giving you you know their data where

306
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,079
you're able to actually feel like you're

307
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,920
doing something meaningful and I think

308
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,000
that was a you know kind of an excellent

309
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,880
uh kind of like a test round before you

310
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,360
really hit the real you know the real

311
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,360
market and maybe you're still figuring

312
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,120
out which you know is the exact pathway

313
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,880
you want to take in the infant program

314
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,199
and I think that provides you a really

315
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,040
great testing point to what you really

316
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:22,040
want to do and no I think the the

317
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,279
overall um support that you get uh with

318
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,240
from the CDO and all the different

319
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:32,000
faculty you know within the m0 uh just

320
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,519
um group is is pretty tremendous I think

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,600
uh you know I heard you can have

322
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,600
unlimited career advising appointments I

323
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,760
abuse that uh quite a bit so yeah

324
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,760
there's you know lots of

325
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,480
support um I can chiming here um so I

326
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,000
think the opportunities that's like

327
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,160
George mentioned like the CD

328
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,279
opportunities like appointments I

329
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,320
panicked during my first summer when I

330
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,959
saw everyone else it's like um

331
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,079
recruiting like filing out online

332
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,160
applications so I threw a lot of emails

333
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,120
at CDO people I was like can I have an

334
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,920
appointment and yes I also abuse that um

335
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,880
and I also use a lot of like the resume

336
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,959
editing and stuff like that which is

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,720
definitely helpful another thing that I

338
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,440
want to mention would be um CDL in a

339
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,160
good way like CDO kind of pushed you or

340
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,079
at least me push me to like look for

341
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,160
more opportunities checking with me to

342
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,720
see if I landed on like interviews with

343
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,519
the status of my current recruiting and

344
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,199
it feels like like coo people are like

345
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,680
more in a rush than I am actually so

346
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,839
that's like definitely good to always be

347
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,480
on the spot like sort of like being a

348
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,360
little bit I wouldn't say like being

349
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,120
pressure but always like someone is like

350
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,680
kind of like asking you to reach out to

351
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,279
make sure that you're doing the job not

352
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,399
just like being you know sort of like

353
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:52,279
lazy on the end just doing school work

354
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,800
not recruiting so that's definitely one

355
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,759
of the thing that I think CD did really

356
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,240
good at least on me by asking me the

357
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,880
progress by giving me like appointments

358
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,440
by checking with

359
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,920
opportunities um so sort of that and I

360
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,519
do remember that there are like weekly

361
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,560
emails from CDO career development that

362
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,880
we um there are like open opportunities

363
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,600
listed online with like the links to the

364
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,399
applications so that saves me a million

365
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
hours basically from like just like

366
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,399
looking through Linkedin or like other

367
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,399
career opportunities um another thing

368
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,800
that I do want to mention is the

369
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,560
community

370
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,040
of the M students

371
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,360
um like all of us were basically very

372
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,440
Hands-On in terms of recruiting

373
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,320
everything so that Community would

374
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,279
definitely drove at least me um sort of

375
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,839
like to keep recruiting in mind not just

376
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,079
to forget about that because besides

377
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,040
cours workk we would talk about

378
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,240
recruiting we would talk about

379
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,519
interviews so that like that Community

380
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,560
sense definitely fer my sort of like my

381
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,560
progress on recruiting as

382
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,560
well yeah definitely absolutely

383
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,519
seconding both of them and just adding

384
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,160
on a couple of things so I so the the

385
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,040
mbas I believe have this program called

386
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,360
New York Finance day where you get to go

387
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,920
to New York but I just wanted to say the

388
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,440
CD was so proactive and because I had

389
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,120
enough work experience under my belt I

390
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
they actually put in my name and I was

391
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,000
allowed to accompany the mempin for that

392
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
program which is very very helpful and

393
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,399
uh get in front of all the prospective

394
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,639
employers so I just wanted to put

395
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,600
Testament out to how proactive and

396
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,920
incredible the CDO is and secondly just

397
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,000
uh going further into what Emily touched

398
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,759
upon like the even the students that you

399
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,360
study with are so incredible like I

400
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,720
didn't come from like any sort of a quan

401
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,000
background at all and I still don't know

402
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,680
a lot but uh but my interview needed me

403
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to know a little bit of option math and

404
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,680
I was fortunate enough that I had my my

405
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,279
fellow students training me before the

406
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
interview and stuff and I was able to do

407
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,560
well enough so yeah so please take

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,240
advantage of like the people around you

409
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,480
yeah yeah well and also um it was our PR

410
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,199
our privilege to work with all of you

411
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,759
there was no abuse of our advising

412
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,160
that's what we're here for but it was

413
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,319
always nice to see each of you in our

414
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,319
offices um I want to leave time for

415
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,720
questions in the audience so I'll my can

416
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,240
I give one last question Diane yes

417
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,399
absolutely great I just want to think

418
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,839
put yourself back uh two years ago when

419
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,279
you're deciding to apply to M fin you

420
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,120
know what's one thing you wish you knew

421
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,120
um then that you know

422
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,040
now I probably say prepare more um I

423
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,160
think there's a there's a bit of a

424
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,880
buffer uh between when you're accepted I

425
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,120
think it's usually around early March

426
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,560
until you start in July um I would be

427
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,759
remiss to say that you shouldn't use

428
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,720
every second that you have preparing for

429
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:47,440
the program um because as Ian said as

430
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,440
well earlier the the the summer that

431
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,040
converts into when you are you're taking

432
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,000
it is an accelerated timeline over the

433
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,480
summer and you are going to feel a lot

434
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,519
of pressure with the recruiting

435
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,000
timelines so the more prepared you'd be

436
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,079
going and on all the kind of topics and

437
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,079
honestly The Faculty does an amazing job

438
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,760
on making sure that they get you

439
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,280
everything you need to prepare for so

440
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,959
utilize the materials that are given to

441
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,039
you before you start just so you can

442
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,039
it'll allow you to utilize the time that

443
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,199
you have in the program while you're

444
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,439
there because it is it does go by fast

445
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,120
St feel like man I'm s yeah as Emily

446
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,120
said oh my God it's already been six

447
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,120
months

448
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,440
that's great advice again we can't

449
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,919
overemphasize that

450
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,520
enough yeah I think one thing that I

451
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,840
wish I knew before joining would be um

452
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,600
definitely reach out to MIT people um

453
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,160
you know working at an investment bank

454
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,360
right now we receive a lot of like

455
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,960
networking emails um and if there's like

456
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,880
an email from MIT email address no

457
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,520
matter it's you know no matter it's for

458
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,360
like networking or if it's for like a

459
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,159
general chat into the banking industry

460
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,200
or if it's asking if we have any open

461
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,280
opportunities we would answer to those

462
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,520
especially if you know we study at the

463
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
same

464
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,080
school if like you know user alarm

465
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Network for sure um whenever I see like

466
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,120
an MIT email coming through I would

467
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,200
respond to it um although that might be

468
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,480
like a delay response given how given my

469
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,039
email volume but yes we would um answer

470
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,360
that not even even if we don't have any

471
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,919
openings you know like email us with a

472
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,400
resume we'll keep that on file if

473
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,240
there's an opening we can probably think

474
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
of you and then we can go from there so

475
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,120
that's definitely one thing that I do

476
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,480
want to uh let everyone know that if

477
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,640
you're an MIT kit uh email us we'll

478
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,720
respond great yeah absolutely I I just

479
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,120
second both of them in fact I just did

480
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,799
like an a referral for somebody who

481
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,080
applied at the firm so yeah

482
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,799
definitely yes and we talk a lot about

483
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,960
the network and engaging in the

484
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,440
community so even you know while you're

485
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,000
in the program being able to leverage

486
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,360
all those resources not only your fellow

487
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,799
mfin classmates but also anyone you

488
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,720
engage with uh when you're participating

489
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,600
in clubs or attending conferences

490
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,280
speaker series um all of the different

491
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,679
activities that are open to all of our

492
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,760
students really um can help to build

493
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,960
that additional community and networking

494
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,919
that's so important so I'm going to go

495
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,520
through there's um quite a few questions

496
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,840
some of them I think Laura may be more

497
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,200
for you but um let me see if I can find

498
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,679
um a couple of those that you could

499
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,760
answer and then for the alums as well so

500
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,280
um there is a question around

501
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,280
pevc and um you know enin students being

502
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,320
able to launch their careers directly

503
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,280
from enin into that and I know that I

504
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,440
know Laura we understand that industry

505
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
pretty well but I'll leave it to you to

506
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,720
respond to that

507
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,360
one okay sure happy to take that one so

508
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,039
you'll see in our employment reports you

509
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,600
can look at year after year we do have a

510
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,679
small percentage of students that go

511
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,280
into private Equity or Venture Capital

512
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,880
following the program it's usually

513
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,520
hovers around four or five% of the class

514
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,320
each year what what's true about the

515
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,120
private equity and Venture Capital

516
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,039
industry is they often like talent that

517
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,880
has a few years of work experience under

518
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,760
their belt already and so a lot of our

519
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,640
enin students aspire to go into private

520
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,280
equity and Venture Capital but they'll

521
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,200
do it by going to banking first and then

522
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,280
after two or three years pivoting into

523
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,440
that space um others also go through the

524
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,280
strategy Consulting route those tend to

525
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,760
be the most common Pathways to break in

526
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,480
there that's true for the US market it's

527
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,159
broadly true internationally as well

528
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,480
there can be some more opportunities to

529
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,559
go directly into PE in the European

530
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,600
market it it varies but generally we do

531
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:03,360
have a lot of EMP interested in that

532
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,120
space more in the medium to longterm um

533
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,840
career goals yep yeah absolutely and

534
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,400
again this also is important as it

535
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,159
relates to what we just talked about

536
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,200
engaging in the community getting

537
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,960
joining the pebc club networking with

538
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,120
you know our mbas executive mbas all

539
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,440
many of whom may have already had work

540
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,480
experience in that industry and they can

541
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,039
be you know again for your future you

542
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,840
have that mit.edu after your email um it

543
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,320
really is a very powerful um way to to

544
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,760
develop those networks in that community

545
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,240
so there were a few questions around the

546
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,400
rise of fintech of course and Ai and

547
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,840
other technological advances um what are

548
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,640
we seeing if at all um and maybe this is

549
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,919
for you Laura too but if the panelists

550
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,320
have any thoughts on it you know in

551
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,520
terms of how this is impacting the work

552
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,520
that they do or

553
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:59,360
careers great question I can let um the

554
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,400
panelists speak to the work that you do

555
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,080
in terms of how AI is impacting as far

556
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,760
as the career support and recruiting

557
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,600
opportunities it's something that we're

558
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,559
seeing a lot of our students leverage

559
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,320
for additional practice there's a lot of

560
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,840
ways that AI can help you prepare it

561
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,559
gives you additional practice it can

562
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,880
help you with your research it can help

563
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,559
you with feedback um and so we are

564
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,279
helping educate students on how to

565
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:28,640
utilize AI to help really accelerate um

566
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,720
their preparedness

567
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,919
also sourcing job opportunities I've

568
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,600
seen some uh AI leveraged as well for

569
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,080
that yeah and I mean I will also add to

570
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,480
that just what you know MIT is after all

571
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,520
research institute hence there is a

572
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,799
tremendous amount of um work and

573
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,840
opportunities to engage in the community

574
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,559
here around AI fintech we have the

575
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,240
gallab center for finance um and policy

576
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,799
research that does a tremendous amount

577
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,640
of work in fintech space um we've got

578
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,559
the lab for financial engineering and

579
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,760
then just throughout MIT because keep in

580
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,240
mind while you're at MIT Sloan um and it

581
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,880
often times you can find yourself

582
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,880
getting you know sort of caught up in

583
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,039
the bubble of MIT Sloan there's the rest

584
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,640
of MIT um that has a ton of work that's

585
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:17,000
being done in this space so there's lots

586
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,039
of ways for you to engage um and just

587
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,640
learn what's happening in terms of the

588
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,640
research as well as potential

589
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,720
opportunities anything else from our

590
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,720
alums on this topic

591
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,480
yeah I think um luckily if at least on

592
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,360
like a banking perspective like if

593
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,279
you're going to a more Boutique firm

594
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,520
imlet like uh like we're at I think the

595
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,679
you're you are able to leverage more of

596
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,880
use of using llms in some way uh you

597
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,799
know any kind of Open Source uh uh

598
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,320
format there and then implementing you

599
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,559
know a level of using Python and some

600
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,960
tasks like they're especially when you

601
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,960
know you are given a lot of data from

602
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,200
clients or there isn't some kind of data

603
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,400
analytics uh or kind of route that needs

604
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,520
to be done I think you are given a bit

605
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
of freedom to do so you know even in

606
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,760
like a a banking side but from like

607
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,559
maybe a broader industry I know it is

608
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,760
being used from like a more bulge

609
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,240
bracket perspective on helping them you

610
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,080
know like automate certain of tasks on

611
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,320
their reach out or automating on some of

612
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,760
the pitch deck creation where it's a

613
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,440
little bit easier on that side um and

614
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,360
then on the Quant side I think yeah it's

615
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,559
it's just going to be uh ultimately the

616
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,159
being at MIT as D was saying is

617
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,039
definitely the best place to be in terms

618
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,799
of getting a kind of a Competitive Edge

619
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,159
going into that market where having the

620
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,000
level of understanding and the level of

621
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,200
competition is going up and your great

622
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,720
understanding of how a lot of things

623
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,880
working uh I mean I I I took like a an

624
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,640
an LP class in finance and it was you

625
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,360
know I was with all of uh all my team

626
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,840
were went into you know Quant research I

627
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,080
was a very lucky to be on their team um

628
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,000
but I think yeah I think they there's a

629
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,640
lot of opportunity there for you know

630
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
MIT to prepare you whether you're going

631
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,360
the Quant side or the banking side

632
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,520
because of the different Dynamics I'm

633
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,480
going to keep you on the hook for a

634
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,559
minute George I know you'll you'll be

635
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,720
fine with this so one of the questions

636
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,000
for you

637
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,880
specifically was around the fact that

638
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,360
you know yes you're in corporate finance

639
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,919
but you you know had came from an

640
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,880
engineering background sort of what what

641
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,520
made you kind of sort of what put you in

642
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,320
the direction of the career choice that

643
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,559
you made launching your career and and

644
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,799
let me just preface it not to answer the

645
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,399
question for you but keep in mind that

646
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,600
this program is it's not just about the

647
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:47,600
first job out of the gate it's an entry

648
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,760
point for you into the field of finance

649
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,279
and so hopefully we'll give you the

650
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,120
skills that you need to really um have a

651
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:55,559
lifetime career in finance and that

652
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,320
could go in a number of different

653
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,880
directions but that said I'm going to

654
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,399
give you an opportunity George to

655
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,159
respond to

656
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:07,320
that yeah no of course I think in uh uh

657
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,799
I think ultimately for me like I had to

658
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,760
be very honest with myself with what I

659
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,559
was most interested in doing long term

660
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,279
uh I think a lot of the people that are

661
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,320
coming in the program that are more

662
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,440
focused whenever I you know I did come

663
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,559
in thinking the you know i' just done

664
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,600
engineering The Next Step must be the

665
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,360
financial engineering and ultimately

666
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,520
from taking the summer classes I found

667
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,679
that I was actually much more uh

668
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,640
oriented to wanting to do more of a

669
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,320
corporate finance track where it be more

670
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,960
the banking or the or something in in

671
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,399
those regards and definitely fell in

672
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,399
love with a lot of the banking side I

673
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:43,600
know yes you work you know long hours

674
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:47,159
and all those things but I find the job

675
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,520
very rewarding um so ultimately be yeah

676
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,399
just had to be honest with myself I

677
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,919
think other people coming into the

678
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:55,360
program that have the idea that I want

679
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,880
to you know work in a pod and a hedge

680
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,640
fund and or be a PM uh for and I see

681
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,799
that as a long-term career choice then

682
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,200
yes I think the um you know the more

683
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,880
quantitative side is definitely the the

684
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,559
way to go and you know honestly the I

685
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,120
know I saw the the median uh you know

686
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,399
base salary coming out I could

687
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,880
definitely is far higher on the if

688
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:19,399
you're going on the quantitative side

689
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,279
the uh it is a very attractive pathway

690
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:23,399
but uh but yeah for me I think it's it's

691
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,559
also playing to your strength I think as

692
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,320
you can tell from the call I'm probably

693
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,200
better interacting than uh you know than

694
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,880
am against some of the people in uh you

695
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,039
know in some of the financial

696
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,360
mathematics classes so yeah that's great

697
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,159
thank you George appreciate it and Arjun

698
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,519
it looks like we have a question for you

699
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,600
about um a little bit different Tac but

700
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,159
um how did you position yourself as a

701
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,440
good candidate without having a

702
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,640
quantitative background I'm not quite

703
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,559
sure that that's exactly what you

704
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,760
intended for them to understand about

705
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:55,519
your background but let let let's

706
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,159
suffice it to say that when we talk

707
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,480
about quantitative background from an

708
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,799
admission standpoint we're looking for

709
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,000
individuals who can again if you've had

710
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,640
an opportunity to look at our

711
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,840
application which I encourage you to do

712
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,840
if you're really interested it's live

713
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,200
there is some relevant coursework it's

714
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,919
these are not prerequisites but having a

715
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,880
solid foundation in what's one of our

716
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,000
finance faculty likes to refer to as

717
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,559
Elemental mathematics um linear algebra

718
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,799
calculus probability statistics these

719
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:27,159
are going to set you up to really um you

720
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,799
know be able to take advantage of

721
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,919
everything that MIT and mm fin has to

722
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,120
offer without feeling like you're always

723
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,519
catching up and so Arjun I'll let you

724
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,760
sort of uh no no absolutely fair

725
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,720
question uh so I uh so I we made a

726
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,399
conscious effort before replying so I

727
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,360
had done uh I learned a lot of python on

728
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:48,360
my own firstly but secondly i' had also

729
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,240
taken two college level math classes

730
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,120
which are after my undergrad like where

731
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,600
yeah so that really prepared me uh to be

732
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,840
fine enough for both yeah basically for

733
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,720
the first class and so forth yeah yeah

734
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,919
great great now thank you Arun and yes

735
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,360
coding a while again it's not a

736
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,440
prerequisite um it's really helpful to

737
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,399
have some familiarity with python in

738
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,120
particular and in fact as part of the

739
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,880
admissions process there will be um an

740
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,640
assessment if you advance in admissions

741
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,320
um past the application there will be as

742
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,840
part of the whole interview and

743
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,240
admissions process there will be an

744
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,600
assessment that includes a little bit of

745
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,320
coding and some mathematics so again

746
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,360
this is these are just foundational

747
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,480
we're not asking you to have advanced

748
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,360
python um but some coding familiarity

749
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,039
and of course just again a strong

750
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,279
foundation in

751
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,519
mathematics um so I think there were

752
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,519
some questions around uh ESG and impact

753
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,640
investing I don't know if any of our

754
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,880
panelists had an opportunity to take any

755
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:51,159
classes or maybe um got to do a course

756
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,080
somewhere or even an action learning

757
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:57,120
lab did anyone

758
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,840
hear yeah I did a u I did an action

759
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,960
learning lab with was with u tzp Group

760
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,679
which is a small uh private Equity Firm

761
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,360
in New York and it was basically the uh

762
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,559
studying the impact of uh how carbon

763
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,320
credits can be uh used in alternative

764
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,240
investing and which was I thought it was

765
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,480
a great experience um you know it was it

766
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,120
was not only uh you know being able to

767
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,159
come to New York and work with the the

768
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,760
team and but also kind of learning about

769
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,399
their investment approach and how they

770
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,320
were looking at opportunities in this

771
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,039
space and kind of how they could

772
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,679
leverage the existing uh like especially

773
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,880
like the EU ETF where there's a lot more

774
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,760
built out uh than it is in the US aside

775
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,760
from you know California having a bit of

776
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,200
a system there and I definitely had uh

777
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,440
there is plenty of opportunities far

778
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,240
beyond uh impact in you know just in

779
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,039
that you know one action ring line at

780
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
sure yes and we we actually thank you

781
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:56,480
George and we have an impact um Finance

782
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,240
club we have an impact Finance um

783
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,600
concentration within the program that is

784
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,519
optional so if it's an area or space

785
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,039
that you're very interested in pursuing

786
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,840
there's definitely um as George

787
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,320
mentioned many opportunities to engage

788
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,240
in that so we're getting close on time I

789
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,360
want to finish off our with our alums um

790
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,679
and for each of you um I thought this

791
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,399
was a an interesting question because we

792
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,360
talk a lot about the program and the

793
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:23,960
academics and the curriculum while of

794
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,399
course this is the primary focus but

795
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,960
love for each of you to answer the

796
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,159
question of how did you balance

797
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,480
coursework and any social fun activities

798
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,519
that you got to engage in as part of

799
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,519
being at MIT in the

800
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,120
community oh yeah absolutely I think

801
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,240
that's a huge part and uh one of the

802
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,960
clubs which I never failed to go for was

803
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,080
the wine club so I was a part of the

804
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,799
Sloan wine club during my time there and

805
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,720
yeah that really helps me out even today

806
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,200
when we go for networking events and

807
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,720
they clients out so yeah so that's so I

808
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,840
think MIT and the sloon community gives

809
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,200
you a lot of opport unities whether it's

810
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,240
like just your work or you can go wine

811
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,799
ceiling I think a lot yeah unbelievable

812
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,480
opportunities so yeah so definitely take

813
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:10,919
advantage of those yeah but certainly

814
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,039
test your time management skills correct

815
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,720
yes yes yes yes please don't go for one

816
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,120
if you have an exam the next day yeah

817
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,120
exactly thank you

818
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,440
Aran Emily George oh go ahead George oh

819
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,519
yeah yeah um I think the luckily the the

820
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,600
the structure of the program kind of

821
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,399
indirectly allows for like a super

822
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,440
tight-knit Community within the infant

823
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:40,159
program because whenever you do come in

824
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,120
over the summer you know in July and you

825
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,840
know the weather is beautiful in Boston

826
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,840
uh infant is really the the only you you

827
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,320
kind of have slown to yourselves uh for

828
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,399
that summer term and it kind of and of

829
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,240
course it being accelerated I think uh

830
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,159
the study rooms are usually always

831
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,720
filled uh all day long and late end of

832
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,240
the night so that kind of environment

833
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,279
allows you to get really close to people

834
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,120
and kind of find your you know find your

835
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,600
kind of close Community while also being

836
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,679
uh connected to the broader Community

837
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,240
within the infant program as well uh and

838
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,000
yeah you tend to just you know people

839
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,039
are always you know Fridays you know

840
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,240
going out and hanging out or you know

841
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,480
you you can sale at MIT as well I know

842
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,600
some some of the friends in in the

843
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,480
program absolutely love theiling um they

844
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,480
ask me probably every day to go out with

845
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,360
them uh it's there's a lot of

846
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,799
opportunities there okay great

847
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,120
Emily yeah um one thing that I didn't

848
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,559
get to do I didn't really have the

849
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,880
chance was um selling I really wanted to

850
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,760
do it but somehow I didn't really get

851
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,360
that course so for whoever's interested

852
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,720
definitely register early um I think

853
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,960
other than I mean I had a lot of fun

854
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,519
when I was in Boston course work versus

855
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,639
recruiting versus you know your own time

856
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,760
I think it definitely is hard when

857
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:00,600
especially when with kick off like in

858
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,799
summer when it's like an accelerated

859
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,320
summer as George mentioned and it's also

860
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,960
like packed study rooms at SLO

861
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,320
everywhere um but meanwhile like besides

862
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,240
that if you work for like you know the

863
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,280
whole day until

864
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,960
like 5 or 6 p.m. then you know have fun

865
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,480
with your classmates or like friends for

866
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,200
like a dinner and then maybe I don't

867
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,240
know some wine um it's it's it's all

868
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,520
doable it's not going to be like 247

869
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,560
you'll be grinding or like studying but

870
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,240
it does require a lot of like commitment

871
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,720
into study but it's it's not like that's

872
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,320
the only thing so don't be scared um I

873
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,359
think that I think that definitely

874
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,520
course design um you know we had the

875
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:39,320
choice of basically choosing what

876
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,119
courses we want to take in terms of like

877
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,520
uh what's required versus what's you

878
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,720
know like the credit thing that we have

879
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,720
to fulfill but overall like you do have

880
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,200
the choice of um choosing you know like

881
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,919
how how busy you want it to be like this

882
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,760
semester uh balancing off like a

883
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,520
recruiting timeline so I know my friends

884
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,440
and I basically chose lighter end of

885
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,280
like course load like dur fall semester

886
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,079
given the recruiting schedule and then

887
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,599
once we secured offer luckily um spring

888
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,560
semester was when we chose probably a

889
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,400
little bit more like more difficult more

890
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,359
time committed classes so we did have

891
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,000
the option to balance off cour work and

892
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:17,000
recruiting and fun and fine and that's

893
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,280
exactly what we want students to do is

894
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,839
to be able to really again it's it's a

895
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,960
balance and it's sometimes not easy to

896
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,640
strike that balance but it sounds like

897
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,640
all of you were able to take advantage

898
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,640
of of a lot of things at MIT
