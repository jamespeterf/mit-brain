00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,520
good morning everybody Welcome to the

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:09,559
mpg primer series um today we have the

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,920
pleasure of having R speaking Jordan is

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,559
a fifth year PhD student in Alex Price

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
research group in the department of

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,760
epidemiology at Harvard School of Public

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,320
Health Jordan's current research focuses

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,359
on methods development for caal variant

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,320
identification using

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,240
multi- before his PhD Jordan was an

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,719
associate computational biologist with a

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,239
data science group here at the Bro

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,000
Institute um with that he's talking

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,000
about population structure and AD

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,360
mixture today do we have some slides

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,039
up thank you oh um feel free to raise

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,879
your hand and ask questions throughout

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,520
the talk there's a microphone in the

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,840
middle and I could also bring you one if

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
you raise your hand so yeah I'm Jordan

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,960
uh and I used to be an associate

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,079
computational biologist here now would

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,160
come to this lecture and the other MPG

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,239
lecture pretty often and it kind of help

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,840
me like figure out what I want to do for

26
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:08,320
my PhD so it's uh exciting to come back

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,280
and give back um and today we'll be

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,280
talking about uh population structure

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,280
and AD

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,520
mixture and so this is the outline for

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,720
the presentation um we're probably not

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
going to get through it all like we'll

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,240
probably just get through the population

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,680
structure part and like feel free to ask

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,079
questions because I'd much rather have

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,880
us get through a little bit of this

37
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,520
lecture and uh have us all actually

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,320
understand what's going on and uh get

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
through all the floods first we'll talk

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,399
about population structure uh some

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,960
background and then go through three

42
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,200
different approaches towards inferring

43
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,479
population structure um and then if we

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,079
have time we'll get to population ad

45
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,720
mixture talk about an interesting

46
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,240
phenomenon that is caused by ad mixture

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,240
um and then talk about how to infer

48
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,840
local

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,759
ancestry and so without further Ado uh

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
population structure you can find it in

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,000
different ways uh but it can refer to GE

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
genetic differences due to Geographic

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,119
ancestry another definition is

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,079
differences in alal frequencies or hype

55
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,159
frequencies among different groups or

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,039
populations within a species and then

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,960
population ad mixture an admix

58
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,479
population is a population with recent

59
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,399
ancestry from two or more uh continents

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,920
or groups that were uh previously

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,879
isolated so why study population ad

62
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,800
mixture um the first reason is that

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,080
helps us understand human migratory uh

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,920
patterns and ancient history uh the

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,360
second reason is to improve our power to

66
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,840
identify and localize disease genes and

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
understand mutations that cause disease

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,040
um I won't really talk about gwos

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,599
because that's the subject of the primer

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,760
for next week but understanding

71
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,319
population structure and kind of

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,200
handling it appropriately is a

73
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:40,720
prerequisite for doing effective

74
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,840
Vios um okay so one of the definitions

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,840
for population to structure talked about

76
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,080
alal frequencies and so to kind of

77
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,319
understand what's going on here we

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,400
should just start with this object

79
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,319
that's called a genotype Matrix uh each

80
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
row of the genotype Matrix contains data

81
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,720
for an individual uh that we have

82
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,720
mutation calls for then each column of

83
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,560
the genotype Matrix corresponds to a

84
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,120
specific mutation that might occur in

85
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,319
each person person's genome one zero one

86
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,400
or two times and so this first entry

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,040
zero uh in the one one that has a zero

88
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,959
here uh that's saying that individual

89
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,080
one has zero copies of mutation one and

90
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,360
then if we go down one we can see that

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,120
individual two has two copies of

92
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,040
mutation one um and so we're going to

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
see a lot of this genotype Matrix today

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,200
but if we look at this we might start to

95
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,720
notice something and and it's that some

96
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,680
of the rows are colored red and some of

97
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,840
the rows are colored blue uh but really

98
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,000
what we're supposed to see is that like

99
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,080
the red rows tend to have a similar

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,280
pattern of genotypes and the blue rows

101
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,799
tend to have a similar pattern of

102
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,159
genotypes and so just going into a

103
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,680
little bit more detail we can see that

104
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,680
in the first two columns uh the red rows

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
tend to have zeros and maybe a couple

106
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
ones in the first two columns and the

107
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,319
blue rows tend to have twos and maybe a

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,720
couple of ones in the first two columns

109
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,080
this corresponds to us saying that

110
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,439
mutations one and two are pretty common

111
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,120
in the blue rows and mutations one and

112
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,159
two are pretty rare in the red rows then

113
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,519
it switches at mutation three um and so

114
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,079
now red has high Valu blue has values

115
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,519
and so if we want we can now just

116
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,079
directly compute simal frequencies um

117
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,599
and so to do that uh we can group all

118
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,599
the red individuals and then uh sum the

119
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,200
number of mut times we observe each

120
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,079
mutation and then divide it by the

121
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,359
number of chromosomes and so that's two

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,919
times the number of people so here we're

123
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,120
going to sum up this column we get one

124
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,840
and then we divide it by eight because

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
there's four times two people or

126
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,639
chromosomes and so that's how we get

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
this alal frequency and that just tells

128
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,400
us how common a mutation is in a

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,600
population um

130
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,039
and so what we can see here is that we

131
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,440
have these patterns where all the red

132
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,199
people seem similar all the blue people

133
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,720
seem similar one potential explanation

134
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,680
for this is that uh these two groups of

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,039
people have ancest have distinct

136
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,919
ancestries or uh have descendants that

137
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,240
from distinct continents and that's one

138
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,560
thing that could cause this pattern Neal

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,199
frequencies and this is exactly what

140
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,680
we're talking about when we talk about

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
population

142
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,919
structure and so to take uh make things

143
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,759
just kind of more concrete you can look

144
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,560
at a very specific mutation RS 10913

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,960
before then look at three populations

146
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,280
that have been sequenced in this uh hmap

147
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,919
project so we have Northern Europeans

148
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,639
from Utah uh uin individuals from

149
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,680
Nigeria and Han Chinese individuals from

150
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
Beijing we can see that this mutation

151
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,960
has different frequencies in these three

152
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,280
populations there's nothing particularly

153
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,400
interesting about this mutation but it's

154
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,400
like an example of how we might have

155
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,639
different alal frequencies but if

156
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,319
instead of looking at just one mutation

157
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
uh we choose to look across the genome

158
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,479
we can look at these three different

159
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,000
populations and kind of quantify the

160
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,600
degree of uh genc Divergence between

161
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,960
these three three populations and that's

162
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,560
what's happening um in this FST metric

163
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,160
where uh High values mean that two

164
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,800
populations have diverged uh have lots

165
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,440
of Divergence genetically low values

166
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,680
mean that there's very little Divergence

167
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,039
so we can do this and kind of do this

168
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,960
pairwise analysis across these three

169
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,840
populations but uh so if we want we can

170
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,280
pick any two populations and say what is

171
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,759
the genetic Divergence between these two

172
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,360
populations maybe that's interesting or

173
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,400
not but it's important to understand

174
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,880
that uh kind of the variation the

175
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,440
genetic variation that exists between

176
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,000
populations is much smaller than genetic

177
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,440
variation that exists within populations

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,720
and so Rosenberg at all 2002 science

179
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,919
takes a crack at estimating these

180
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,880
quantities and they say that 5 to s% of

181
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,160
worldwide human genetic variation is due

182
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,759
to genetic differences between

183
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,639
populations the remaining 93 to 95% of

184
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
human genetic variation due to genetic

185
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,080
variation within

186
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,319
populations um and so given that uh

187
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,280
maybe these population labels are are

188
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,120
unable to explain most of the genetic

189
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,039
Vari

190
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,720
why consider this at all and so in

191
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,680
genetic analyses individuals are often

192
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,400
classified based on their Continental

193
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,520
genetic ancestry this is this warer to

194
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,520
the continents or subcontinent from

195
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,080
which individuals distant ancestors have

196
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,560
historically resided and so this is

197
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,319
really based on oops

198
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,120
um where your genome has come from uh

199
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,199
and it's distinct from self-identified

200
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,319
race or ethnicity um and so however this

201
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,960
approach of kind of classifying

202
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,560
individuals based on their Continental

203
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,759
genetic ancestry glosses over lots of

204
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
within continent genetic heterogeneity

205
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,160
but it does capture some extremely

206
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
important historical migratory patterns

207
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,440
so this model like obviously loses lots

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,400
of detail and isn't objectively correct

209
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,800
but it captures some may still be useful

210
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,360
um and there exist alternative

211
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,120
approaches that allow us to understand

212
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,960
genetic structure on a much finer

213
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,199
scale and those are really important um

214
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,400
but to continue let's just look at an

215
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,360
example of kind of one approach towards

216
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,240
classifying or anal izing population

217
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,400
structure uh this is the output from a

218
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,319
modelbased clustering program such as uh

219
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,879
structure and so the way that we should

220
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,479
interpret this plot is that uh each

221
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,120
super skinny colored bar corresponds to

222
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:48,479
a single individual um and

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,039
uh I can't use this to move can I okay

224
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,759
um each super skinny uh colored bar

225
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
corresponds to a single individual and

226
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,639
then the colors of that of that bar

227
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,919
correspond to the ancestry contribution

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,240
from different groups so uh for example

229
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,159
in the European individuals we can see

230
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
that there's lots of blue that

231
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,639
corresponds to European ancestry however

232
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,080
we can see that in some group in the

233
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,280
middle uh there's a lot of sizable

234
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,720
proportion amount of orange contribution

235
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,240
so that corresponds to their these

236
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,039
individuals having a sizable uh amount

237
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,879
of uh African genetic ancestry in

238
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,000
addition to their European genetic

239
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,360
ancestry

240
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,720
[Music]

241
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,120
um

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,479
yeah and so I mean this is like a very

243
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,840
coarse grain approach where we've kind

244
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
of just said let's just Suppose there

245
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,279
are six ancestry groups in this

246
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,279
population that we're analyzing however

247
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,279
if we want we can be much more granular

248
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,279
about things so this is from a recent

249
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,279
bioarchive preprint who at all 2023 um

250
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,880
and in this paper they instead of uh

251
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,720
just classifying individuals based on

252
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,600
their Continental genetic ancestry they

253
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,600
take the UK biobank resource and try to

254
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,000
classify the individuals uh based on

255
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,079
much smaller regions they divide the UK

256
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,160
and Ireland into 23 different regions um

257
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:06,720
and then in each region they uh classify

258
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,959
the individuals or they they uh estimate

259
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,440
the genetic ancestry using these these

260
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,920
very small regions in addition to some

261
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,880
other Global regions and so we can see

262
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,959
here this plot is basically just all the

263
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,680
individuals that are from Cumbria and so

264
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,200
we can see kind of which color each

265
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,200
region is we have to match the color

266
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,240
from the region from the map to the

267
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,800
color in uh our ad mixture plot but here

268
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,040
we can see there's a lot of individuals

269
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,279
that have primarily auman ancestors

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
however there's a sizable portion of

271
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,480
individuals that have primarily

272
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
Northumberland ancestry which makes a

273
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,480
lot of sense because Northland is right

274
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,680
next to kumria and we can tell like a

275
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,120
similar story about North Yorkshire um

276
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,440
and so like that's that's pretty cool

277
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,480
but the point of this slide is just to

278
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,560
show that we don't have to use uh these

279
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,360
super large Continental ancestry groups

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,440
to understand our ancestry we can be

281
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,800
much more granular about things um so

282
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,720
that's kind of the background for

283
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,720
population structure uh feel free to ask

284
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,480
any kind of broad questions about our

285
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,480
understanding of it but if there aren't

286
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,440
any of those we're going to go into the

287
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,120
inference so we're going to talk about

288
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,320
three different approaches for uh

289
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,399
inferring population structure and uh so

290
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
we'll start with these tree based

291
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,320
approaches these are some of the

292
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,519
earliest approaches and

293
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,680
um they're kind of well we'll see

294
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,279
they're simpler than the other ones and

295
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,000
so what we see here is this is a big

296
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,760
tree um and all the leaf nodes at the

297
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,480
very end of the tree the the periphery

298
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,279
of the tree correspond to individuals

299
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,160
that we uh have genotyped and are

300
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,399
analyzing um and then we can interpret

301
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,240
this tree roughly as a a tree Will Group

302
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,760
individuals that have similar genetic

303
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,000
ancestry or or look similar genetically

304
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,000
um and we can roughly think of the

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,839
distance of the path between two leaves

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
of this tree so if I go up and then back

307
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,800
down we can think of the length of that

308
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,120
path as some approximation of uh the

309
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,040
genetic similarity or distance between

310
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,959
two individuals um and so now we'll talk

311
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,160
a bit about exactly how we get a tree

312
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,160
like this

313
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,800
so living in this certain region are

314
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,800
mixed have mixed ANW to

315
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,720
fromion does it mean we are referring to

316
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,680
a past where there was no mixture or was

317
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,279
there always a mixture and then they

318
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,000
start because it's looks like circular

319
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,120
the you say people from their areas but

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,399
when they all mix or when not mix yeah I

321
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,440
mean uh it's it's it's a very good point

322
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,920
kind of how you find

323
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,720
is of how far back we want to look or we

324
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,480
understand is like yeah these previously

325
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,720
isolated population so we get

326
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,920
some

327
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:51,200
uh information how make this fall based

328
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:55,600
on population that have been previously

329
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,120
isolated oh we think of European

330
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,240
individuals long

331
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,240
being uh

332
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,120
European so it's a tricky question to

333
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,320
answer um but and it requires some call

334
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,399
but it's kind

335
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,360
of it's true that if we go back far

336
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,040
enough all populations kind of have to

337
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,000
be ad mixed um but

338
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,320
these labels uh these kind of

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Continental ancestry groups are still

340
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,279
useful for understanding population

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,240
structure because the populations have

342
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,040
been isolated for a long time as a

343
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,120
result there has been genetic Divergence

344
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,000
between them so taking that genetic

345
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,760
Divergence into account is important is

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,760
that is that that a decent answer yeah

347
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,600
thank you okay good cool

348
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:53,320
um cool so now we're back to our

349
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,880
genotype Matrix and so uh just to re re

350
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,560
interpret this again uh this one here

351
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,360
means that individual two has one copy

352
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,360
of mutation to um and so here we have

353
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,959
genotype Matrix for eight individuals

354
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,519
and 10 Snips just in our cartoon example

355
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,760
um and in order to turn this to turn

356
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,079
this genotype Matrix into uh some tree

357
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,320
structure that tells us about the

358
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,480
similarity between individuals uh the

359
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,199
first step is to compute differences

360
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,680
between genotypes and so kind of the

361
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,600
most straightforward approach to doing

362
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,800
this is to take one genotype subtract it

363
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,120
from the other genotype and then take

364
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,399
the absolute value of each of uh those

365
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,760
genotype terms so 0 minus one is

366
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,639
negative 1 and the absolute value of it

367
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,480
is one so we'll do that for every single

368
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,160
one of these columns then we'll sum up

369
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,959
the absolute difference and divide it by

370
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,279
the number of markers and so this just

371
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,959
tells us a kind of crude metric of

372
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,880
exactly how similar do these genotypes

373
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,760
look uh and then we'll do this for every

374
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
pair of individuals and so we'll end up

375
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,320
with like because they're eight

376
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,800
individuals in our data set we'll have

377
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,480
like an 8 by8 distance Matrix um and

378
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,959
then from here we just apply some

379
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,320
hierarchical clustering algorithm uh and

380
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,320
kind of like a hand wavy way the way to

381
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,160
think about these algorithms are uh

382
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,160
either we we start with all of our eight

383
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,880
individuals in one big cluster and then

384
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,399
we split it into two clusters and then

385
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,959
we the way that we decide that

386
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,079
partitioning of the individuals into two

387
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,759
clusters is we try to uh minimize some

388
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,320
like something like the sum of the

389
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,880
distance between individuals in the two

390
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,880
clusters so we kind of have two groups

391
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,199
that looks similar to each other then

392
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,959
we'll continue to divide those two

393
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,360
clusters until everybody has their own

394
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,279
cluster or alternatively we'll start

395
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,120
with uh everybody in their own cluster

396
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,720
then we'll kind of merge these clusters

397
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,160
based on the distances to each other um

398
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,079
and so I'm I'm kind of not doing a great

399
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,639
job like explaining this component of

400
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,839
the inference in detail but I'm doing

401
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,199
that because I think the rest of the

402
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,880
inference methods are more interesting

403
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,360
and so uh but it's it's uh definitely

404
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,240
like if you're interested in this read

405
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,160
more into it it's cool um but so now if

406
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,920
we do that for a larger data set than

407
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,560
our eight individuals we might end up

408
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,519
with the tree uh diagram like this and

409
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,199
so um in order to kind of let's look at

410
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,920
this tree diagram for a second we can

411
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,560
see here um it's kind of hard to see

412
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,480
here but uh the oh maybe I should go

413
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:12,839
back so like in this picture we can see

414
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,440
uh the legend for this figure uh tells

415
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,079
us kind of what geographic region these

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,160
individuals were sampled from and then

417
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,320
they code it based on the shape of these

418
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,199
uh nodes so we can see here that mostly

419
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,959
we have circles together over here and

420
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,480
mostly we have squares or diamonds

421
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,000
together over here that corresponds to

422
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,279
individuals that were sampled from the J

423
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,319
same geographic region having similar

424
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,720
genetic ancestries to each other um so

425
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,199
that's what we see here but there's a

426
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,880
few other interesting observations that

427
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,560
we can take from this tree structure uh

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,639
the first is that as I mentioned before

429
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,000
we can think of the distance of or the

430
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,920
length of the path between two

431
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,639
individuals as being an approximation of

432
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,360
the distance between those individuals

433
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,279
and so we can see here is that the

434
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,600
distance uh of the length of the path

435
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,040
between two individuals from the same

436
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,240
population is similar to uh is only a

437
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,759
little bit smaller than the length of

438
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,079
the path between to individuals from

439
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,440
different ancestries or different

440
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,800
populations and that's kind of

441
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,360
Illustrated in the cartoon and the right

442
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,519
like the distance between uh a to a is

443
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,720
only a little bit smaller than the

444
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,120
distance we from A to B this is kind of

445
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,959
consistent with that slide earlier where

446
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,160
I was claiming that uh Continental or

447
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,480
population labels are unable to explain

448
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,720
most of the human genetic variation um

449
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,399
feel there's one other thing that I

450
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,720
wanted to say about this

451
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,959
figure um oh and one other thing just to

452
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
notice is that we aren't able like the

453
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,720
output of this uh inference method

454
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,160
doesn't give us a number of like uh what

455
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,120
is the percent ancestry from this group

456
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,199
for this individual uh and so we can

457
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,040
kind of see it and kind of understand

458
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,839
what's going on in the data but uh

459
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,160
having an explicit estimate of this

460
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,000
quantity which is uh what portion of

461
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,800
your genome comes from a given ancestry

462
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,120
group will be really helpful in some

463
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,000
applications and we don't get it from

464
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,880
this type of method um so uh with that

465
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,560
motivation we can move on to uh a group

466
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,120
of methods which we'll refer to as

467
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,319
model-based population structure

468
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,799
inference and so uh one good thing about

469
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,520
these methods is that they will give us

470
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,640
that number of what portion of an

471
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,160
individual's ancestry came from a given

472
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,160
group um and so so this kind of group of

473
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,240
methods is a little bit uh the I think

474
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
the name is kind of deceptive because

475
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,600
like a lot of these approaches assume

476
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,439
some kind of model but here the model

477
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,760
what we mean by modelbased clustering or

478
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,520
uh population structure inference is

479
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,559
that uh we're going to propose an

480
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,640
explicit generative model for our

481
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,919
genetic data that's kind of based on our

482
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,600
understanding of genetics um and then

483
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,880
use that genetic model to do our

484
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,880
inference and so here uh let's just get

485
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,919
ourselves familiar with the uh data

486
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,080
objects that we're going to be working

487
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,960
with so G is our genotype Matrix and uh

488
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,120
that's the same object that we've

489
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,960
already interpreted a couple times g l

490
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,679
is the number of mutations of number of

491
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,240
times mutation L occurs in individual I

492
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,480
and then we have these other two objects

493
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,640
uh there's this P Matrix and so the

494
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,280
dimension of p is uh the number of

495
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,600
populations that we have contributing to

496
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,159
our individuals in G uh by the number of

497
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,919
snips and so each individual and or each

498
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:14,360
entry in L tells us how common snip uh L

499
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,840
is in population k sorry I think I said

500
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,039
something wrong there uh each entry in P

501
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,039
is uh tells us about how often mutation

502
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:25,240
L occurs in population k um and this is

503
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,400
just what we were Computing on that

504
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,880
first slide where we had the blue and

505
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,080
the red individuals um and then we have

506
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,840
this Q object and so uh the the the Q

507
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,200
object we can think of as our ancestry

508
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,360
proportion Matrix um and so each entry

509
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:48,159
in Q tells us what the proportion of

510
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:50,320
ancestry uh K is an individual I so uh

511
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,200
if this if if if

512
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,039
q11 is one then we're saying that

513
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,000
individual ones ancestry is all from

514
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,080
population one um and so for now just to

515
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,840
make things simple we're going to assume

516
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,520
that Q is binary and that each row has a

517
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,000
single one and uh all the rest of them

518
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,679
are zeros and so this corresponds the

519
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,799
assumption that all of our individuals

520
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,360
have ancestry from uh one group each so

521
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,640
there's no ad mixture this isn't a good

522
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:20,360
assumption uh but we'll relax it in a

523
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,559
second um and so just to really drive

524
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,320
home exactly what Q is this is like a a

525
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,080
sample 23 and me report and for Jamie it

526
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,080
says that they have 74% European

527
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,280
ancestry 17.5% subsaharan African

528
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,640
ancestry and so these are example values

529
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,559
that might go in Q like Jamie would just

530
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,320
be one row across this way and they

531
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,480
would it be four numbers in here um

532
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,480
except it wouldn't fit our current

533
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,520
structure because uh Q has only one one

534
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,000
right now and all the rest are zeros um

535
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,880
okay so now we're going to talk about

536
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,679
our infant strategy kind of at a very

537
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,760
high level uh this is kind of this is a

538
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,240
an outline for how to do uh comput a

539
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,840
maximum likelihood estimator which is

540
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,440
kind of a general statistical thing

541
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,080
you'll probably run into

542
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,400
um but the first step in doing this

543
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,080
inference is going to be propos a

544
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,039
generative model that relates our

545
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,440
observed data oh I I forgot to say

546
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,039
something um here there's a dash line in

547
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,400
the middle uh and so we're asking

548
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,960
ourselves what's up with this dashed

549
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,880
line and so the things on the left of

550
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
the dashed line are the object is the

551
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,799
data that we're assuming that we've

552
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,200
observed and have access to so we can

553
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,480
like load G and P directly into memory

554
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,679
in our computer and mess around with

555
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,840
them but Q is uh uh what we want to find

556
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,280
out this is our unobserved variable that

557
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,400
we want to under that we want to do

558
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,360
inference on um and so the first step in

559
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,840
our inference strategy is to propose a

560
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,919
generative model that relates our

561
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,600
observed data to are object of in

562
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,679
inference and so in words this is going

563
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,600
to be relate our genotype and alal

564
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,360
frequencies to uh the unobserved

565
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,679
ancestry proportions that we want to

566
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,640
infer um the Second Step will be to use

567
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,559
the generative model to write out the

568
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,480
probability of The observed data given

569
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,240
the unobserved data and so this is going

570
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,159
to be we're going to write out the

571
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,880
probability

572
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:06,760
of our observed genotypes given uh the

573
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,159
ancestry uh the ancestry proportion

574
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,720
Matrix q and then finally uh we're going

575
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,640
to find the values of q that maximize

576
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,320
the probability of our observed data and

577
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,279
those will be our favorite values of Q

578
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,960
so this is very not specific and we'll

579
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,039
go into this in in more detail so the

580
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,600
first step is to propose a generative

581
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:29,559
model that relates our genetic uh or

582
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,480
observed data to the unobserved data and

583
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:35,120
so here our generative model is going to

584
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,159
be that uh the genotype for individual I

585
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,279
at mutation L given that they're in

586
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:44,720
ancestry K is binomially distributed

587
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:47,679
with parameters p k l and 2 and so to

588
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,679
make that kind of less mathy uh we can

589
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,559
say that if individual I uh we're trying

590
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,279
to say what is the distribution of

591
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,600
mutations for an individual that is in

592
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,440
ancestry K we're basically going to flip

593
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,080
coin twice uh and then we'll take the

594
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,039
sum of the number of times that that

595
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,559
coin comes comes up heads and the coin

596
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,720
comes up heads

597
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,640
uh with a probability equal to the alal

598
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,279
frequency and so kind of intuitively

599
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,320
each individual has two chromosomes uh

600
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,960
if I tell you that both of those

601
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,320
chromosomes come from a given ancestry

602
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,960
then we would expect those chromosomes

603
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,840
to have a given mutation based on the

604
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,320
alal frequency of that uh mutation in

605
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,240
that population and so hopefully this

606
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,600
this first statement is is kind of clear

607
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,799
now um so the second step is going to be

608
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,640
write out the probability of our

609
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,960
observed data for individual eye so here

610
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,080
this equates to uh writing out the

611
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,159
probability of an individual ey's

612
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,240
genotype given that they're from

613
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,360
population or that they have ancestry K

614
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,320
and so here this GI corresponds to one

615
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,720
row of that genotype Matrix and we can

616
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,279
write out the full probability for GI as

617
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,159
the product of each of the probability

618
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,600
of the individual mutations and so we're

619
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,520
making some assumption here saying that

620
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,240
the mutations are like independently

621
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,159
distributed uh but we're not going to

622
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,440
worry about that for now but basically

623
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,760
yeah let's just go back to this so we're

624
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,400
looking at the probability of one row of

625
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,880
this G Matrix and we're going to say

626
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,880
what's the probability of GI i1 and

627
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,840
multiply it by probability of gi2 do

628
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,880
this for the entire row of this Matrix

629
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,080
this gives us the probability of

630
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,880
individual's observed genotype so now

631
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,559
we'll notice that g l given Qi K is

632
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,559
equal to one that's exactly what we have

633
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,200
up here and so uh uh we can just go to

634
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,000
Wikipedia and look up what is the

635
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,200
probability for a binomial distribution

636
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,080
like what's the equation for the

637
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,080
probability of a given outcome from a

638
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,480
binomial distribution and just plug that

639
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,840
in for p of G given Qi K is equal to one

640
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,120
and so that's exactly what we've done to

641
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,679
get to this next line is we've just

642
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,640
replaced this pgil with the Wikipedia

643
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,000
probabilities uh for a binomial

644
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,480
distribution so now the third step is we

645
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,799
just have to ask ourselves uh is this

646
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,840
quantity maximized when we have

647
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,480
individual coming from ancestry one or

648
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,760
ancestry 2 or ancestry 3 um and so now

649
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,279
we'll just go into a workout example of

650
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,880
this we're doing we're assuming that we

651
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,360
have two populations we're going to try

652
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,400
to figure out whether this individual

653
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,039
has ancestry from population one or

654
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,039
population two and so the end of the

655
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,480
first row of equations is just that

656
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,080
exact

657
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,960
um equation from the last slide and then

658
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,320
we just plugged in the numbers and so

659
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,880
like

660
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,399
G11 is this individual's genotype at

661
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,279
snip one P1 L is the population one a

662
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,360
Leo frequency at snip one um and that

663
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,600
those are all the things we have to plug

664
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,320
in here and so we'll just do that for

665
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,000
each snip and then we end up with some

666
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,399
uh equation which we can evaluate

667
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,240
numerically and we get

668
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:45,159
022 so that's the probability that

669
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,080
individual one's genotype would occur if

670
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:48,559
they're in population one and then we'll

671
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,520
do the exact same thing for population

672
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,559
two so now we're just plugging in these

673
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,840
alal frequencies from population two

674
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,000
instead of the IL frequencies from

675
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,240
population

676
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,440
one and uh then we just just compute

677
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,320
what that number actually is we get

678
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,520
068 and so uh we have these two numbers

679
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,960
and we can see that the probability of

680
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,720
indiv individual ones genotype is higher

681
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,200
if they're in population two and so our

682
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,679
estimate is that this individual is

683
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,760
probably from population to um okay so

684
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,840
this approach assumes that each

685
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,120
individual belongs to a single ancestry

686
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,559
we just compared the individual the

687
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,080
probability of individual ones genotype

688
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,559
if they're in population one the

689
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,640
probability of individual ones genotype

690
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,480
if they're in population two however we

691
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,840
know that admx populations uh exist and

692
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,240
and have genetic ancestry from

693
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,080
populations that were previously

694
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,720
isolated so can we change our generative

695
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,279
model to uh no longer have this

696
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,480
assumption that individuals belong to a

697
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,039
single ancestry group and so here we

698
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,159
have the exact same data objects as

699
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,440
before G and P are on the Le hand side

700
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,320
indicating that these are observed

701
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,600
objects Q is on the right hand side but

702
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,600
now we're goingon to assume that each

703
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,440
row of Q has values between zero and one

704
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,760
that sum to one uh I guess there's an

705
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,840
extra this whatever um

706
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,480
and but so it's the same as I mean now

707
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,399
it's now we're actually in a case where

708
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,039
we can give Jam's 23m report where here

709
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:12,840
now we have contributions from multiple

710
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:15,440
different ancestry groups um and

711
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,000
so in our inference kind of at a high

712
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,880
level strategy is going to be exactly

713
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,120
the same Ros Model A generative model

714
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,919
that relates our observe data to the

715
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,320
object of inference use the generative

716
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,000
model to write the probability of the

717
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,600
probability of The observed data and

718
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,919
then to find the values of q that

719
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,000
maximize the probability of The observed

720
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,120
data and so first let's just I mean the

721
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,840
hard part of this is just going to be

722
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,039
kind of Transforming Our generative

723
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,640
model so before we assumed uh this

724
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,720
distribution for the genotypes of

725
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,919
individual L at mutation or individual I

726
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,840
mutation L um but then here this assumes

727
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,760
just that q i k is equal to one which is

728
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,120
saying individuals I only has the K

729
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,000
ancestry group uh but this doesn't isn't

730
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,720
going to work anymore so intuitively if

731
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,440
individual I has 25% ancestry 1 and 75%

732
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,039
ancestry two then you expect their

733
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,799
genotype to look like a weighted average

734
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,200
of the Leal frequencies from ancestries

735
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,120
1 and two with weights 25 for ancestry 1

736
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,799
and 75 for ancestry 2 so the weighted

737
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,399
average of the Le frequencies at snip L

738
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:16,200
is just going to be this thing so we've

739
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,760
taken this is the the Leal frequency at

740
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,880
snip L 25% of that and then this is the

741
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,279
Leal frequency at uh in population two

742
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,440
75% of that and so we just have to take

743
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,000
this number and plug it in for our our

744
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,399
old ilal frequen that's exactly what

745
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,640
we've done here so here we've just taken

746
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,039
the old binomial distribution that we're

747
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,520
using before changed the first parameter

748
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,519
to reflect individuals like indiv

749
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,000
individual eyes personal weighted alal

750
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,600
frequency based on their ancestry

751
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,320
proportions so now our strategy is going

752
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,120
to be basically the same all we have to

753
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,880
do is now uh change our generative model

754
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,200
up here that now has individual eyes

755
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,159
personal alal frequency based on their

756
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,840
uh weighted uh ancestry

757
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,120
proportions and then we're basically

758
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,640
going to do the exact same procedure

759
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,960
down here de like like right individual

760
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,080
eyes uh the probability of individual

761
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,120
eyes genotype as the product of all the

762
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,360
mutations and then we'll just plug in

763
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,120
our our Wikipedia binomial uh

764
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,600
probability equation down here um and so

765
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,080
here this Alpha parameter is what we're

766
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,159
doing what we're using to quantify the

767
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,240
proportion of individual eyes ancestry

768
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,559
from population one and then one minus

769
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,120
Alpha would just be uh the proportion of

770
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,960
individual eyes ancestry from population

771
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,679
to and then we just have to figure out

772
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,360
exactly what value of alpha maximizes

773
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:43,360
this equation for each individual and so

774
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,480
here uh we have a worked out example

775
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,799
um I've yeah here so we're just going to

776
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,360
figure out exactly we we we can uh plug

777
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,240
in our values for individual eyes

778
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,960
genotype and the different minor or the

779
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,679
different alal frequencies into that

780
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,440
equation from before and now we have uh

781
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,840
an and the only variable here is Alpha

782
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,880
and so this is just going to be the the

783
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,519
probability of individual eyes genotype

784
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,880
at different ad mixture proportions and

785
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,159
we can just graph this out and so here

786
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,480
this is the uh numerical value for that

787
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,039
last equation where we vary Alpha across

788
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,279
many values and we can see that

789
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,760
uh individual eyes genotype is uh much

790
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,799
higher sorry uh we maximize this

791
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,919
quantity when Alpha is equal to 0 22

792
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,039
which corresponds to individual

793
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,200
individual I having 22% ancestry from

794
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,360
population

795
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,600
one and so now

796
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,960
um up until now we've assumed that we

797
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,080
have access to some a Leo frequency

798
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,080
panel where we know the Leo frequency

799
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,279
for each individual or sorry we know the

800
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,039
Leal frequency for each mutation in each

801
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:51,320
population um that's this P Matrix

802
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,840
however um and so this is like there are

803
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,240
many resources that we can use to get

804
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,200
this alal frequency reference panel um

805
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,840
however there's maybe maybe that's not

806
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,320
so good if we don't really know exactly

807
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,159
what populations are contributing to

808
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,360
each individual um in our uh like maybe

809
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,440
there's some population that isn't

810
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,120
included in our reference panel that has

811
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
contributed ancestry to our genotype

812
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,799
Matrix G um and so now we're going to

813
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,880
try to do this exact same inference

814
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,640
problem but move p over to the right

815
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,480
hand side of the dash line and so that

816
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,200
means that now instead of assuming that

817
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,519
we have access to some alal frequency

818
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,480
reference panel um we're going to assume

819
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,960
we're going to infer our Alo frequencies

820
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,640
from the dat

821
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,760
um and so now our inference approach is

822
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,120
a little bit more complicated um because

823
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,880
we have to infer both Q the ancestry

824
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,760
proportions and P the alal frequencies

825
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,760
of each ancestry

826
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,679
um and so at a really high level our

827
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,640
approach is going to be just alternate

828
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,360
between estimating the alal frequency

829
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,039
Matrix assuming that we have the

830
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,559
ancestry proportions and then uh go on

831
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,039
to estimating the ancestry proportions

832
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,480
uh given that we have the Le frequency

833
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,360
Matrix and so this is uh similar to an

834
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,519
approach used by software uh such as

835
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,000
structure and AD mixture but it's it's a

836
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,559
simplified version of this but it kind

837
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,679
of gives you the intuition behind what's

838
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,480
going on um and so to do this approach

839
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,480
we're first going to take in each value

840
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,679
of Q basically just randomly assign

841
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,760
ancestry proportions so say individual

842
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,480
one is in is in population one

843
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,679
individual two is in population three

844
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,399
randomly assigned q and then we'll use

845
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,000
that randomly assigned Q to estimate a

846
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,000
frequencies um given our current

847
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,720
estimates of the ancestry proportions

848
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,679
and then proceed to estimating uh

849
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,760
individual ancestry proportions based on

850
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,279
the current estimates of ilal

851
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,440
frequencies uh and so like this P update

852
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,639
P given QEP is just taking the means of

853
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,360
all of the uh ancestry of the genotype

854
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:52,519
Matrix what's

855
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,679
up

856
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,679
yes thank you

857
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,039
um do you have to provide this approach

858
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,840
with the number of populations that you

859
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:14,000
think yeah okay that's and they're SL on

860
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,559
it in a second

861
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,880
oh

862
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,880
um yeah I mean here in all of these

863
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:28,240
mates you can

864
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:31,279
see one how that's a tricky question um

865
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,760
okay so here um we just take turns

866
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,880
estimating the frequencies given the

867
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,279
ancestry proportions then estim ancestry

868
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,080
proportions given the legal frequencies

869
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,600
this updating legal frequencies just

870
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,880
taking means of our genotype Matrix uh

871
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,600
and then

872
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,720
updating an portions even our new

873
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,039
frequencies is exactly the procedure

874
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,679
that we went over like three slides ago

875
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,960
so we're going to do like this thing a

876
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,639
bunch of times until we reach some

877
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,000
stable solution um and it's kind of

878
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,519
wacking that we can like find the true

879
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,120
anti just starting from random

880
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,960
assignments because like initially this

881
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:09,080
frequency Matrix isn't telling us very

882
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:12,679
much but it works out which is cool um

883
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,159
so yeah as as you just asked uh do we

884
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,240
have to provide this method with the

885
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,399
overall number and S population and the

886
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,679
answer yes um so here we run this

887
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,000
algorith on a big dat varing number of

888
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,320
populations and uh you can see that when

889
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,159
we set the number po

890
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,760
the method basically spits out ancestry

891
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,360
proportion that correspond to like

892
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,720
African like European ancestry vers

893
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,159
Asian plus American Oceanic an that's

894
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,000
kind of the main division that we get

895
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,919
from but then as we increase K all the

896
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,200
way you start to get much more granular

897
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,440
an definition and like you get the

898
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,240
smaller group of individual uh that have

899
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,559
their own kind of

900
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,080
end uh category and so it's not at all

901
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,320
obvious which of these answers is

902
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,159
actually right and that's a major

903
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,799
disadvantage of this kind of method so

904
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,600
maybe we have some ground truth about

905
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,119
how many intersections we expect to use

906
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,520
to see the data this will be good but

907
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,720
It's Tricky it's not obvious what the

908
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,679
cor K is here um so uh that's a good

909
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,720
motivation for moving on to PPA based

910
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,520
population

911
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,320
structure so uh phal component analysis

912
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,520
uh is a very general data analysis

913
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,399
technique you'll in all kinds of fields

914
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,639
kind just try to get intuition behind

915
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:35,320
what's going on we have a data set with

916
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,200
two features X1 and X2 um the first

917
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,040
principal component is going to be the

918
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,560
feature along which the data varies to

919
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,639
or we'll kind of try to consider all the

920
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,480
potential axes in our data and then find

921
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,440
the one that spread the the data out the

922
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,639
most along this active um so then on WE

923
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:57,400
computed component one proceed to

924
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,400
identify the a which explained uh the

925
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,000
max variation kind of taking into

926
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,200
account the first principal component

927
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,520
and so here I in this example with two

928
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,119
uh features it's kind of silly like

929
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:13,560
there only one compon but we can do this

930
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,720
with much larger uh dat here this is

931
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,160
what component analysis will look like

932
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:22,160
when we do it on gen we have I

933
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,839
individuals and L mut um and then

934
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,440
basically our first principal component

935
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,320
will try to capture as much of the

936
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,560
variation uh

937
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,880
in G is possible and so basically what

938
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,640
the first princial component will

939
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:41,040
capture corresponding to this well this

940
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,720
first Matrix uh going to be many

941
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,480
mutations that co- kind the maximal

942
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,200
combination of mutations that coar

943
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,319
together and if we think about it like

944
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,560
what group of mutations are veryy likely

945
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:58,560
to co together uh a reasonable guess is

946
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,119
something like because of individuals

947
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,040
have uh an from group one they're going

948
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,960
to have a bunch of special bu mutations

949
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,920
that aren't about high frequency in mut

950
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,680
in population two and similarly

951
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,359
individuals from population two have a

952
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,920
bunch mutations that aren't seen in

953
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,079
population one so we're going get lots

954
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,240
of shared mutations that are varing

955
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,119
together and uh that might be what you

956
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,560
expect and unfortunately it's exactly

957
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,079
what you and so this is uh PCA run on

958
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,480
one of the really early population um

959
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,200
SEC data sets called

960
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,920
um we have European Nigerian Chinese and

961
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,319
Japanese ancestry individuals and you

962
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,480
can see that when we do PCA on it pc1

963
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:43,480
captures primarily captures differen

964
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,160
between uh the African uh the Nigerian

965
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,800
and the non- Nigerian individuals and

966
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,800
then PC2 captur primarily captur between

967
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,119
the European and the non European

968
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,119
individuals IND kind of these uh

969
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,200
population structure uh maximally cap

970
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:02,119
lot of variation of the

971
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,440
Matrix um and so interestingly uhal

972
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,800
component analysis can also capture

973
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,359
continental adure and so here um in this

974
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,640
figure the authors have compated Native

975
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:16,040
American European AR data uh with

976
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,119
Hispanic genotype Hispanic Latino

977
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,599
individuals as well as africanamerican

978
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,359
individuals um and so what we can see

979
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,640
here is that uh many of these

980
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,440
populations kind of occupy these

981
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,079
distinct regions of this plot and also

982
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,720
see that like

983
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,200
uh but there's also lots of variation

984
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,000
Within These groups and so individuals

985
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,160
that identify as uh Dominican uh from

986
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,760
from being from the Dominican Republic

987
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,599
uh have kind of this unique ad mixture

988
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,280
profile so we can interpret the

989
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,000
intermediate values between these far

990
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:52,079
groups as uh these individuals having um

991
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,440
contributions from different continental

992
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:59,440
ancestries and uh so here it's probably

993
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,079
like it's important to say um a lot of

994
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,800
this ad mixture like for example in the

995
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,800
African-American individuals or between

996
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,839
the African and the European individuals

997
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,079
this reflects uh some Legacy of slavery

998
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,079
that

999
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:14,079
uh appears in our genetic data and so

1000
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,800
it's probably good to not just treat

1001
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,920
this uh with complete Detachment and

1002
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,040
kind of acknowledge uh the historical

1003
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,240
events that have led to this

1004
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:28,359
um

1005
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,440
so the next figure is uh

1006
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,119
it's like everyone's favorite figure um

1007
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,000
and so it's it's from November at all

1008
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,000
2008 nature and what the authors do is

1009
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,040
they take a bunch of different European

1010
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,160
uh ancestry individuals and do PCA on it

1011
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,079
and uh on the left they have PCA so this

1012
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,240
is just uh basically the maximal axes of

1013
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:49,000
variation in the genotype Matrix and if

1014
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,520
you compare the figure on the left to a

1015
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,560
real map of Europe on the right they

1016
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,319
look kind of similar right so it's like

1017
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,480
Portugal and Spain are like down here

1018
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:58,240
like it is on a real map um you have

1019
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,160
like Great Britain and SC Scotland up

1020
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,319
here like in a real map and we go to the

1021
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,240
East and like there's some France uh and

1022
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:06,079
so like how crazy it's like we just have

1023
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,319
the genotype Matrix and we remade a map

1024
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,079
of where these individuals are from

1025
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:13,440
based on it um so this like really uh

1026
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,119
these last two examples have really

1027
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,520
showing us some of the advantages of

1028
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,119
principal component analysis where it's

1029
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,040
like here we're able to like get

1030
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,000
estimates for adure portions I guess we

1031
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,640
could get that from the model based

1032
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,520
framework too but here um we rather than

1033
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,359
having like super distinct isolated

1034
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,000
populations we have kind of alal

1035
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:33,200
frequencies that vary with a gradient

1036
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,079
over space and so it's like there's

1037
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,520
probably small levels of migration a

1038
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,560
long time ago between people that live

1039
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,720
in France and Spain but not a lot and as

1040
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
a result we kind of have these

1041
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,560
continuous Clines of of of uh alal

1042
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,839
frequency differences um and so PCA it

1043
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,640
would be really hard to decide like what

1044
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:50,520
are the correct populations or what's

1045
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,319
the what's the right value of K to use

1046
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,000
here uh but PCA uh makes it easier so

1047
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,880
that we don't have to think about that

1048
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
so much uh we're able to capture these

1049
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,800
continu with differences in Le frequency

1050
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,920
across Geographic

1051
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,119
space um and so a pretty important

1052
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,200
question oh there's a chat is this okay

1053
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,720
um okay uh

1054
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,880
so relevant question here is is

1055
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,000
modelbased ancestry inference or PCA

1056
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,880
better um and so uh model-based

1057
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,280
inference approaches are motivated by

1058
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,119
explicit genetic models uh with distinct

1059
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,640
ancestry groups and as a result they

1060
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,440
impose corresponding constraints so it's

1061
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,480
like the uh the an C proportions are

1062
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,359
guaranteed to sum to one they can't be

1063
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,040
greater than zero or or or less than

1064
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,040
zero or greater than one and the just

1065
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,440
immediately spits out exact estimates

1066
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,800
the quantities that we're interested in

1067
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,040
so that's an advantage for model-based

1068
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,920
inference approaches um and they also

1069
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,240
allow us to impose like some prior

1070
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,960
knowledge on the data like if we know

1071
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,280
that there are three Source populations

1072
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,520
we want to think about it that way we

1073
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,880
can impose that understanding of the

1074
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,520
data on our inference uh however PCA May

1075
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,800
better capture situations where

1076
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,040
population structures uh where structure

1077
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,000
varies continuously if we don't want to

1078
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,920
specify that number of populations then

1079
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,640
we can we'll just compute a bunch of PCS

1080
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,720
and kind of see like where they stop

1081
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,079
capturing things that look like

1082
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,040
population structure

1083
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,599
um yeah so those are advantages of PCA

1084
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,200
over mbased inference but really both

1085
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,160
are useful uh and if you're doing this

1086
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,160
kind of research you uh will find

1087
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,040
instances where you want to use each of

1088
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,960
them there's no these chats do I need to

1089
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,640
worry cool no um so how much time do I

1090
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,480
have left

1091
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,359
that is a great question I think we are

1092
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,720
it would be wonderful to have some Q&A

1093
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,760
we're about four minutes before we have

1094
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,800
to do the change over and we're kind of

1095
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:43,160
at a natural stopping point definitely

1096
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:48,480
um let me do one last like yes

1097
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:51,079
oh there's like uh this slide um and so

1098
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,160
this is GNA be my question to you great

1099
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,079
um so I think if you want like this is

1100
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,359
interesting and you want to learn more

1101
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,359
about MPG like when I was a computation

1102
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:58,680
biologist I didn't really know anything

1103
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,359
about this and I got excited about it by

1104
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,920
coming to these the first is you should

1105
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:05,040
keep coming to the mpg primer and the

1106
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,599
mpg seminar uh the next is that my pii

1107
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,599
uh teaches this ep511 class at hsph in

1108
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,240
the spring and he'll let you um probably

1109
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,160
let you just uh audit it if you don't if

1110
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,440
you can actually take a credit and I I

1111
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,599
think it's an awesome class you go over

1112
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,960
like lots of stuff like this in more

1113
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,640
detail and he also shares his slides

1114
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,280
online freely right yeah yeah and so

1115
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,599
like a lot of the slides from his class

1116
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,200
I stole for this and they're all free

1117
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,880
online so you can go check those out and

1118
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,319
like I use those as resource all the

1119
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,800
time and then this book is uh pretty new

1120
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,240
and like not actually finished but

1121
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,160
there's like the first three chapters

1122
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,760
from it and a lot of the slides I also

1123
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,480
stole from that and this book is awesome

1124
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,720
too so check sto with appropriate

1125
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:48,000
credit but yeah uh are there any

1126
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,079
questions about the subject matter for

1127
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,160
presentation let's first give a a round

1128
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,160
of applause for for Jordan

1129
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,240
thanks Jordan that was such a good

1130
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,720
primer um I was wondering do people like

1131
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,839
combine PCA and model based so if you

1132
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,440
say if you want to get the ancestry

1133
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,079
proportions could you look at the

1134
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,319
PCA like and identify how many KS you

1135
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:23,160
want to specify and then put

1136
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,160
that um five

1137
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:36,000
that seem real and then sees that as k

1138
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,520
um I know in some of the modelbased

1139
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,520
clustering literature there is

1140
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,319
discussion of how to choose K and it's

1141
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,559
possible this is suggested as an

1142
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:48,680
approach but I don't know if it is that

1143
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,280
it's a cool idea I think it I like it

1144
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,280
thanks

1145
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,559
nice I've got a question um while other

1146
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,599
people might want to come up to the mic

1147
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,640
uh for the I had a question about the

1148
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:03,760
Assumption about assuming Independence

1149
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,079
between Snips for the generative models

1150
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,640
and given that we know that assumption

1151
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,839
is not true and um do these models still

1152
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,480
perform well or when when do they

1153
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,640
perform not as well yeah

1154
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,000
so it's true that it's typically if we

1155
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,000
just kind of use every snip in the

1156
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,599
genome oftentimes Snips one and two will

1157
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,400
be in linkage dise equilibrium which

1158
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:31,200
means they co-occur or uh never co-occur

1159
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,319
um and that violates our methodological

1160
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:41,319
or our generative data assumption that

1161
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:43,240
GI G G11 is independent from G2 g12 um

1162
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:46,000
and so typically I think the advice is

1163
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,760
to just prune your genotype data such

1164
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,720
that you don't have adjacent Snips in LD

1165
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:58,119
or or or close uh yeah yeah nearby Snips

1166
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,119
in LD um but

1167
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,720
I bet that kind of to what extent you do

1168
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,040
that pruning how strict about it you are

1169
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,200
um

1170
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,880
and you can probably get away with not

1171
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,599
being perfect about things and it'll

1172
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,760
still come out mostly right because kind

1173
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:16,319
of the dominating factors in uh your

1174
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,680
genot type Matrix will be these ancestry

1175
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,760
proportions not this kind of small

1176
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,200
region of LD but it probably you

1177
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,240
probably get better estimates if you

1178
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,280
prune your Snips better and I think that

1179
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,520
some of these methods also do relax this

1180
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,800
assumption that there uh is Independence

1181
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,520
between adjacent Snips uh but I'm

1182
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,880
actually not that sure that about that

1183
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,839
the approach might just be you have to

1184
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,880
do some pruning based onage dis

1185
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:41,520
equilibrium that sounds that sounds

1186
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,559
great um we're almost at we basically

1187
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,040
we're at time but we don't have to move

1188
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:48,720
today the prime the seminar will be in

1189
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,240
here so you guys can get your breakfast

1190
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,400
um and then let's just thank Jordan one

1191
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,400
more time for his wonderful primer
