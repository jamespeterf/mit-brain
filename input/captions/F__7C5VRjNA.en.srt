00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,920
interest, feel free to reach out to me

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,480
Startup Exchange was created 10 years

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,719

world's greatest challenges. We do this

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,680

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,920

faculty or staff while others have

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,119

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,280
targeted startup calls known as

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,519
opportunities. Startups can apply, get

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,160
selected and collaborate with members to

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,400
test and co-develop the solutions.
