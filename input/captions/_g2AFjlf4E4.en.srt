excited to listen to your talk thank you

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
faros

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,680
oh thank you for eating into my 40

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,879
minutes um so I'm going to tell you

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,200
today about some of the work that's

43
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,519
going on in my lab regarding interface

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:26,239
reactions between some medium and Hali

45
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,840
perovskites and in in a way to try to

46
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,120
understand two different phenomena one

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,519
is the phenomenon of degradation how

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,400
these materials break down over time and

49
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,800
the other one is to understand doping

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,840
and see if we are in fact capable of

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,519
either P or n type doping of these media

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
meaning controlling the electron or

53
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,040
whole population of these

54
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
semiconductors so let me start with a

55
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,840
brief introduction for those that might

56
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,560
not be familiar with metal Halli perov

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,280
skites I like to view them as this is

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,879
the unit cell the sort of tetragonal

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,080
system here but I like to view them as

60
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,480
has a series of these metal in this case

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,599
either lead or tin at the center o

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,680
octahedra with six of these apical

63
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,599
iodides or or halides in General on the

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,959
on the outskirts of it and then you have

65
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,680
this asight which is positively charged

66
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,440
which sort of has the right size to

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,519
scaffold this system and also charge

68
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,879
balance it to hold it together in this

69
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:29,000
three-dimensional octahedral Corner

70
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,159
sharing uh sort of uh Mantra and by

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,720
changing the or changing the metal you

72
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,400
can actually sweep the system's response

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,040
from the blue all the way out to the

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,599
near infrared and they're direct bandap

75
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,120
semiconductors so they're interesting

76
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,680
for all types of opto electronic devices

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,280
here's are some examples of LEDs and

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,080
lasers but the real success story has

79
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,400
been in in solar cells and this is a

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,879
little snapshot of the lower right hand

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,599
corner of enr's certified efficiency

82
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,799
chart and you can see that the

83
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:03,519
perovskite which sits here at 26.7%

84
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,200
is really just on the heels of Crystal

85
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
and silicon which is at

86
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,640
27.1% there and if you compare this to

87
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,439
other thinfilm Solar Technologies sigs

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,040
or cadel both around 23% or organic

89
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,959
which there are reports in literature

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,440
over 20% now but at least the highest

91
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,360
point on the chart here is just under 20

92
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,520
um really it it kind of puts them a bit

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,560
to shame to to have substantially higher

94
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,639
performance metrics at least on Day Zero

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,720
the issue with with perovskites and kind

96
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,639
of kind of what brings me here today to

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,440
talk to you about is not in their

98
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,639
initial efficiencies but rather in the

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,360
fact that those efficiencies don't hold

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
for an excruciatingly long period of

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,479
time for most Solar Technologies you

102
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
want that to hold for decade time scales

103
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,000
and that's indeed what silicon can do

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,680
but perovskites the best they've

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,880
demonstrated is somewhere in the

106
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,240
neighborhood of few thousand hours um

107
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,120
for degradation from its day one value

108
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,919
to you know a few thousand hours about

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,520
80% or so of that initial performance

110
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,919
and so when we talk about

111
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,320
degradation in my lab we've we've looked

112
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,840
at a bunch of different degradation

113
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,840
reactions and what we found is that the

114
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,880
the initiation right that first step

115
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,160
always falls into one of these two bins

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,600
first one being charge transfer and I I

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,800
kind of put this in in order of

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,880
importance so this is the first

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
important one the the most important

120
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
reaction that underscores the

121
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,160
degradation of these systems is some

122
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,919
kind of electrochemical or charge

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,479
transfer reaction and that's the one

124
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,759
that I'll spend most of my time here

125
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:40,960
talking to you about um and the

126
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,240
adjacency is an amine so lead can be

127
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
reduced you get this lead zero there's

128
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,080
there's still I think a lot of emphasis

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,880
about lead zero in the community I

130
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,560
deemphasize that um because I think if

131
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,759
you see lead zero you've pushed your

132
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,080
system so far beyond its limits that if

133
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,639
if that's your end end State I think

134
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,080
you're basically clinically dead at that

135
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,759
point so I I don't worry so much about

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,280
lead reduction anymore and I think the

137
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,360
primary lead reductant is an amine which

138
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,360
is actually the the the product of the

139
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,000
other main degradation reaction which is

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,440
an acidbase reaction or something

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,280
involving protons and so you have a lot

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,440
of Organo ammoniums in these systems if

143
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,440
it's deprotonated you can make an amine

144
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,759
and I think that's the primary then F

145
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,599
finally redox region for lead but I'm

146
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,840
not going to get into that today um the

147
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,759
other thing that can happen with am

148
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,000
meines and this is another uh adjacency

149
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,199
is a condensation reaction between

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,680
amines and form amidinium which also

151
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,680
spells a lot of problems for this system

152
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,960
structurally because I end up making

153
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,160
cations I like the most common one is

154
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,199
methyl formamidinium that are just too

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,240
big to fit in that perovskite lattice

156
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,680
and it kind of unfolds uh that system

157
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,720
leads to substantial strain and and

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,520
other things um but things like strain

159
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,000
things like ion migration I like to

160
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,840
think about them as consequences of one

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,360
of these two things and so these are

162
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,919
kind of the the original sin as it were

163
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,160
for Hali perovskite

164
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,160
degradation and here's a really simple

165
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
experiment that can be done in any lab

166
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
if I take a film of

167
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,680
aluminum um on a little piece of glass

168
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,759
and I dip it in methylammonium iodide

169
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,120
nothing happens but if I dip it in lead

170
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,400
iodide it gets completely corroded and

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,960
it goes away in seconds and what's

172
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,160
behind that is an electrochemical

173
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,280
reaction and this is a really

174
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,879
spontaneous one this is an obvious one

175
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,759
this is the one that we first published

176
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,599
six seven years ago now um sorry more

177
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,840
like eight years ago now um and so if

178
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,680
you have an easily oxidized and strongly

179
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,919
reductive metal like aluminum instead of

180
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,599
staying as pristine aluminum zero what

181
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,280
will happen is you'll have a metal metal

182
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,520
cation Redux reaction with lead 2 and

183
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,720
you will generate a lot of lead zero and

184
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,639
you'll generate a lot of aluminum 3 in

185
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,520
the process because uh aluminum 3 is has

186
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,720
a stronger electrochemical potential

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,319
than than than lead 2 to lead zero and

188
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,599
so that's the the end consequence this

189
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
is a very obvious one this is a

190
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,400
spontaneous one what I'm going to talk

191
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,319
to you mostly about today are less

192
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,159
spontaneous or non-spontaneous ones

193
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,960
these are ones that happen with the

194
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,400
application of stress either voltage

195
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,360
bias or light bias and we just published

196
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,879
a couple of weeks ago this perspective

197
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,000
in ACS energy letters and what we're

198
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,159
trying to do is go beyond ion migration

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,840
so ion migration is this often invoked

200
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,520
term in the literature of perovskites

201
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,919
but it doesn't really get to the core

202
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,399
and the Heart of what has happened yes

203
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:39,039
matter moves but what what mediates the

204
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,640
movement of matter the movement of ions

205
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,640
is actually some creation somewhere and

206
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,480
some Annihilation somewhere else and so

207
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,360
these are usually electrochemical

208
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,440
reactions and so behind ion migration is

209
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,920
some sort of electrochemical reaction

210
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,440
because they are the sources and the

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,040
syns of ions that end up

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,399
migrating and so here's a generic

213
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,600
framework for a device I have aaly

214
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,200
perovskite in the middle I have charge

215
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,200
transport layers on either side I have a

216
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,600
metal electrode on one side and usually

217
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,680
I have something like an an fully

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,640
oxidized metal like fto or I on the

219
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,040
other side and there are numerous things

220
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,480
that can happen I'm going to get into

221
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,920
these in the slides that follow um we

222
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,200
have uh potential bulk effects things

223
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,600
like you could have oxidation uh

224
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,920
reduction reactions forming interstitial

225
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,279
halides forming vacancies on the one

226
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,240
hand or you can have reactions on the

227
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,240
charg transport layer perovskite

228
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,360
interface and this could leech out

229
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
iodine or iodide which could then

230
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,800
ultimately oxidize metals and I can even

231
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
bring Metals into the into the picture

232
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,120
here and that's what we'll talk about

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,959
when we talk about doping in these

234
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,920
systems um and you know in order to make

235
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,800
progress here here's an example for the

236
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,079
one that I that keeps me up at night

237
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,720
which is interstitial iodide um and so

238
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,440
you know you have maybe a place here

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,040
where you can generate interstitial

240
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,279
iodide and halide vacancies you could

241
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
also have bulk generation you have bulk

242
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,800
Annihilation that's basically what's

243
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,120
known as self-healing basically these

244
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,560
prod these reactants or in this case the

245
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,760
products of this reaction are new newly

246
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,680
formed reactants to reform the

247
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,000
perovskite lattice and I can have

248
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,800
annihilation of these uh vacancies and

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,160
interstitials to join the lattice again

250
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,920
and so and that's all mediated by things

251
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,880
like generation Annihilation and mass

252
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,079
transport either drift or diffusion of

253
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,920
these interstitial ions this is this is

254
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:43,360
an effect the ion migration equation but

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,200
it needs to be merged with the the

256
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,760
equations of semiconductors continuity

257
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,040
equations Pon equation and so I think to

258
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,720
make progress we need to define the

259
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,720
reactions that happen the ones that are

260
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
most important and we need to develop

261
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,399
models that incorporate and merge these

262
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,079
chemical reactions with well-known

263
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,279
wellestablished semiconductor physics uh

264
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,680
equations and by kind of merging these

265
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,399
we can make a full assessment and a full

266
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,240
model in a mixed ionic electronic

267
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,440
context to better understand the

268
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,440
behavior of these

269
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,600
semiconductors so I'm going to show you

270
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,560
an example of an iodide redo cycle and

271
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,120
something that it does and and one thing

272
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:30,040
that we've established in my lab is that

273
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,880
iodide oxidation is the first thing that

274
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,680
happens which allows for Halli phase

275
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,639
separation so if I have a system that's

276
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,720
now a mixture of halides let's say a

277
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,240
mixture of iodide and bromide the

278
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,880
initiating step of redistribution of

279
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,959
this lattice is basically to create a

280
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,920
lot of vacancies so that stuff can move

281
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,600
around and the thing that creates that

282
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,279
vacancy is iodide getting oxidized

283
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,079
leaving the lce and now stuff can move

284
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,200
about ion migration can happen and this

285
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,760
is fully reversible you can go back and

286
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,000
collapse to the nearly well you know

287
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,839
well mixed uh AB mixed Halli system and

288
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,800
so here's how it works I have an anode

289
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,880
and a cathode anodes on the left

290
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,480
cathodes on the right and I have a

291
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,040
well-mixed x equals .5 uh halide system

292
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,560
in between if I put an anodic potential

293
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,279
on this so a potential difference

294
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,600
between the anode and cathode the as I

295
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,639
mentioned the first thing that we can

296
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,639
expect is iodide can get oxidized so

297
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,760
holes basically um oxidizing these

298
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:38,279
surface the ones on the left here iodide

299
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,079
atoms they leave the lattice they make

300
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,519
interstitials and now we have an

301
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,519
interstitial potential uh sorry an

302
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,600
interstitial diffusive gradient that's

303
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,920
going to cause interstitials to move to

304
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,120
the right we also have a field between

305
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,720
the positive anode and the negative

306
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,440
cathode that could also allow migration

307
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,760
of these interstitials toward the right

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,800
so whether it's diffusion whether it's

309
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,680
drift

310
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,920
uh you can think about it as you will

311
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,079
you also now have vacancies and these

312
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,160
vacancies will also be able to diffuse

313
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,440
and those vacancies are effectively

314
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,880
allowing bromide to net move toward the

315
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,720
left right because the the left the left

316
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,639
side is where iodide gets

317
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,040
oxidized and now I have a lot of

318
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:26,440
vacancies that have moved to the right

319
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,720
here and the electrons can reduce the

320
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,120
iodide so this is the closed circuiting

321
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,760
of this electrochemical cell they can

322
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,440
re-enter the lattice as negatively

323
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,079
charged iodide ions and the net result

324
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,639
is I have an iodide enriched cathode and

325
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:48,120
a bromide enriched anode and if I test

326
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,959
this experimentally we can see if we get

327
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,600
with if this hypothesis is true and so

328
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,519
we have a device here we have nickel

329
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,440
oxide on one side and we have C60 BCP

330
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,519
gold on the other side um initially we

331
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,600
can see the iodide the bromide and the

332
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,639
Le and the lead are all well distributed

333
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,600
vertically in this system and if we

334
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,279
forward bias the system meaning the top

335
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,880
is cathodically biased the bottom is

336
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,480
anodically biased that's my forward

337
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,360
biased situation you can see that the

338
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,560
iodide after some time here has

339
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
collected at the top the cathode and

340
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,519
bromide has collected at the bottom the

341
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,639
anode lead remains well distributed so

342
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,160
lead has little or nothing to say about

343
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,480
this it's the kind of scaffold that's

344
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,720
holding this whole thing together if I

345
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,320
flip the biasing and now the top is my

346
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,160
anode the bottom is my cathode you can

347
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
see the reverse situation has presented

348
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,600
itself the bottom has become enriched in

349
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,160
iodide depleted uh at the top the top

350
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
has become enriched in bromide and

351
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,519
depleted at the

352
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,959
bottom and so this kind of draws this

353
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:56,199
picture of an electrochemical cell

354
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,759
initiating by iodide o iodide redox

355
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,240
oxidation on one side reduction on the

356
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,160
other

357
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,759
and so this is the way we can sort of

358
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,800
schematically draw this we have our

359
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,759
anodic reaction which is iodide

360
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,600
oxidation and we have our cathodic

361
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,600
reaction which is iodide reduction and

362
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,160
all mediated by electrons and holes and

363
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,360
Hall vacancies on this lattice it's a

364
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,079
very simple closed form

365
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,000
situation now what if we do something

366
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,440
like we change out our electrode so

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,720
instead of gold which is a relatively

368
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,839
decent um anode in the presence of

369
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,440
iodide it's not readily etched by iodide

370
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,079
if we change it out with silver again we

371
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,839
have the situation where initially our

372
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,680
our system is well mixed iodide and

373
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,959
bromide and Lead they're all evenly

374
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,519
distributed if I forward bias this

375
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,360
device so silver is my cathode then I

376
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,639
get the same situation iodide is

377
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,240
enriched at the top bromide is enriched

378
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,560
at the bottom it all behaves very

379
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,440
similar to my gold situation but now I

380
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:03,160
reverse bias the situation and silver is

381
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,759
now my anode so what happens is silver

382
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,079
is more easily oxidized than iodide and

383
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,839
so I have effectively interrupted the

384
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:14,279
iodide redo cycle and if I've have done

385
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,160
that then if you believe me that iodide

386
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,759
redo iodide oxidation is at the core of

387
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,920
halide phase separation and

388
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,920
redistribution then because I've

389
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,800
interrupted iodide oxidation I no longer

390
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,279
have halight phase separation and that's

391
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,240
what I see iodide and bromide are all

392
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,319
both well distributed and equal to that

393
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,160
of the lead component and as a

394
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:38,480
consequence I'm actually bringing silver

395
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,839
into this system so silver is now

396
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,279
entering the lattice um as a consequence

397
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,199
because something had to had to have

398
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,560
gotten oxidized and in this case it was

399
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,800
silver and does anyone have a guess what

400
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,800
got

401
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,600
reduced remember I talked about doping

402
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,560
who has a guess what got reduced in the

403
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,839
process of pulling because remember redo

404
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,240
reactions they always have to happen

405
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,160
close close circuited you don't just

406
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,919
matter doesn't like being charged that's

407
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,000
why we have lightning to discharge stuff

408
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,640
but what got reduced when I oxidized

409
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,640
silver and brought it

410
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,439
in I think I heard someone Mumble it

411
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,160
this the Prof guite so the profy got

412
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,280
ended every metal cation that enters

413
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,640
that system the pery gets ended and so

414
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,880
that's going to that's my that's my f

415
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,039
the final part of this talk so I'm

416
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,720
trying to bring it around at the end but

417
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,799
remember this because this will come in

418
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,240
and be important when we talk about

419
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,960
reduction and doping the perov

420
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,919
guite okay so here's the situation here

421
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,160
when my silver is a cathode it's just

422
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,480
the same I have anodic and cathodic

423
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,600
reactions that involve iodide but when I

424
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,840
have silver as an anode now instead of

425
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,760
iodide getting oxidized it's silver that

426
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,240
gets oxidized and I end up creating all

427
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,919
these silver uh interstitials and that's

428
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,000
what is is sort of taking over when I

429
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,000
when I oxidize the

430
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,919
system and so this is only an issue for

431
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,440
mixed Halli systems at high biases right

432
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,960
like we don't have to worry about iodide

433
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,799
oxidation in pure iodide systems do

434
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,159
we yeah we do okay so let's let's talk

435
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,080
about it so we definitely have to worry

436
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:32,200
about it even the absence of bromide um

437
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,799
here's a schematic diagram showing the

438
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,400
kinds of things we need to be concerned

439
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,840
about and I I just want to impress upon

440
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,880
you lead reduction is not in this

441
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,159
slide because I don't really worry about

442
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
lead reduction anymore I don't think

443
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,720
that I think that is not something that

444
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,320
really is important to this system when

445
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,400
again when lead is reduced you you've

446
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,320
pushed it way too far and so this is

447
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,840
taking the archetypal methylammonium

448
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,280
lead iodide I need to worry about at the

449
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,480
anode I need to worry about iodide

450
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,679
oxidation when I have a whole transport

451
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,360
layer I need to be very worried about

452
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,440
the fact that it can react with oxidized

453
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,280
iodides we'll get to that in a moment

454
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,240
and then the reduction reaction I need

455
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,840
to be worried about um ma reduction

456
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,320
methylammonium being reduced in which

457
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,600
case I've have destroyed the system

458
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,280
start total Destruction but I also have

459
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,559
to be worried about gold oxidation when

460
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,880
I make triiodide which I will make in a

461
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,120
whole transport layer triiodide is very

462
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,080
easy to make in a whole transport layer

463
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,000
and triiodide is an especially fantastic

464
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,200
gold eent and so I need to be worried

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,640
about gold oxidation and gold reduction

466
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,520
at the fto interface where it's

467
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,880
cathodically biased and so let's look at

468
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,039
the voltage biased thresholds for these

469
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
different

470
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,760
phenomena so what I'm showing here are a

471
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,960
little hard to read but these are

472
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,120
cross-sectional Toof Sims

473
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,679
uh

474
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,840
um I don't know what you call them

475
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,919
rograms I guess

476
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,159
um depth profiles thank you Tonio um so

477
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,760
what I'm looking at here is the the

478
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,320
profile for gold as well as in the dash

479
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,080
lines the profile for tin which is

480
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,440
showing me where the fto perov interface

481
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:21,039
is that's what the dashed ones are and

482
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,679
so the gold what we see is that 6 volts

483
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,039
7 volts it's not enough to have any gold

484
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
in the system there's basically no gold

485
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,320
and then at some point I've what I've

486
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,280
done is I've effectively pile drived the

487
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,640
gold to that gold fto interface but this

488
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,280
was just the remnant of what we had

489
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,320
scraped what we had neglected to get off

490
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,440
when I when we peeled off the gold

491
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,360
contact and so you see some gold that

492
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,559
shows up here but now when I go to 08

493
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,320
volts 09 volts one volt you can start to

494
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,440
see massive amounts of gold in this

495
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,880
system if I add a spiral layer on top

496
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,320
you can see that I need to push it a

497
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,799
little bit higher and that's basically

498
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,559
because of the voltage drop on the

499
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,440
spiral layer but these are still

500
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,880
shockingly low voltages 1.3 volts 1.2

501
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,280
volts and I'm able to start getting

502
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,360
substantial gold signals that enter this

503
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,440
perov SK so these very low

504
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,400
electrochemical thresholds for gold

505
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,520
oxidation in the presence of triiodide

506
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,559
which if you're oxidizing iodide you're

507
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,720
making

508
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,240
triiodide and for those that would

509
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,840
prefer to see this in kind of a real

510
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,039
space image if you take a system you can

511
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,880
see gold entered and then when you

512
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,960
remove the bias it will actually get

513
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,000
reduced again and you have these gold

514
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,559
colloids that form inside the perovskite

515
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,360
system and it's hard to see here because

516
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,480
we just took a little slice but we know

517
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,480
from XPS profiling if you wash off all

518
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,480
the perov skite there's gold that has

519
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,640
plated out at the at the oxide interface

520
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,640
as

521
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,720
well so I mentioned about Spyro that's

522
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,640
that's the well-known sort of whole

523
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,080
transport material in perov skite solar

524
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,760
cells and these systems there have been

525
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,000
numerous observations in literature of

526
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,679
iodine just soaking these these htms but

527
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,840
what dictates this infiltration is

528
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,200
actually the fact that when I have a

529
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,039
shallow homo system like Spyro and the

530
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,200
shallowness basically needs to be

531
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:20,559
shallower than 5.4 EV I have loads of

532
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,760
electrons at relatively low potential

533
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:27,360
and those electrons are capable

534
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,480
of reducing iodine and therefore getting

535
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,279
pooped um as a result of exposure to any

536
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,240
oxidized iodide if I have a deep homo

537
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,400
system I don't get a lot of this

538
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,760
infiltration because those electrons

539
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,440
just don't exist at relatively shallow

540
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,720
potential and here's an example of

541
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,080
iodine in Spyro so I want to draw your

542
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,840
attention to the

543
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,440
lead um carbon interface here this one

544
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,120
between orange and blue you can see

545
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,000
there's a pretty abrupt interface

546
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,600
between those two profiles between

547
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,400
methyl L iodide in Spyro look at how

548
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,200
much iodine has just soaked into this

549
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,080
system and that's just spontaneous upon

550
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,480
spinning Spyro on top of an iodide

551
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,000
perovskite substantial amounts of iodine

552
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,720
leeches in and if I put a bias on this

553
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,720
thing go to 6 volts not much happens 7

554
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,559
volts look at my iodine signature it's

555
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,600
gone up 8 volts it's gone up even more

556
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,360
and if I put this back in the temm after

557
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,799
1 volt for 20 for 12 hours you can see

558
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,360
this zone of I infiltration has expanded

559
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,840
and so iodine that gets oxidized will

560
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,679
readily enter and dope and you make a

561
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,000
very high a very pooped Spyro at this

562
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,120
interface and as such it kind of makes a

563
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,520
really nice Omi contact it's a great Omi

564
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,559
contact um but it also has its other

565
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,080
drawbacks as well because I now have

566
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,720
this this possible bath and source of

567
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,760
triiodide which is

568
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,200
dangerous um we've measured iodine

569
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,080
diffusion rates basically the same way

570
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,720
that a calcium test works so calcium is

571
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:07,360
a good test for uh IOD uh sorry oxygen

572
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,640
or humidity we've basically taken the

573
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,400
calcium test which which uh basically

574
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,360
you're looking at how much time it takes

575
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,279
for calcium to be oxidized and rendered

576
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,720
uh insulating in the presence of oxygen

577
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:21,520
or water and we've just ported it over

578
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,919
to iodine and so silver is a good is a

579
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,000
good one because silver doesn't care

580
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,399
about the presence of oxygen in water

581
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,120
but iodine will quickly render it in

582
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:33,039
insulating and so we can measure the

583
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,720
amount of time it takes to upon exposure

584
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,200
to an iodine ambient for that silver to

585
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,200
be uh decommissioned to be rendered

586
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,159
insulating and non-conductive and uh

587
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,520
taking two examples here here's poly tpd

588
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,000
shallow homopolymer you can see it

589
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,559
renders UNC conductive within 200

590
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,760
seconds and pvk a much deeper

591
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:55,679
homopolymer and you can see it holds on

592
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
substantially longer and you can fit

593
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,039
these transients to understand the

594
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,760
diffusion Coe ience in these systems or

595
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,880
iodine permeability as it were and what

596
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,440
we see is that shallow homo Organics

597
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,039
whether they're small molecule whether

598
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,399
thermally evaporated whether they

599
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,720
polymers um spin coated anything that's

600
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:16,159
shallow you have quick diffusion of

601
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,159
iodine anything that's deeper and you

602
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,559
have much slower diffusion and this

603
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:27,840
energy around here is what we associate

604
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,159
to this iodine I triiodide iodide redo

605
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,720
couple it's going to be somewhere in

606
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,360
here and that's kind of where we see

607
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,000
massive transition from Fast re Redux

608
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,200
mediated iodine transport to much slower

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,960
redo mediated iodine

610
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,399
transport and unfortunately I put a gulp

611
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,760
here the methylammonium Le iodide or or

612
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:49,840
any iodide perov skites its homo energy

613
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,000
sits right here so if I want a whole

614
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,279
transport layer that's capable of

615
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,520
injecting or extracting holes from the

616
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,720
perovskite it's also unfortunately

617
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:06,000
capable being doped by iodine and being

618
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:09,520
this sort of uh readily uh mobile uh

619
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,520
circuit for iodine

620
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,120
transport to close this picture we can

621
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,840
see that iodine also dopes these shallow

622
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,039
whole transport layer organic so we can

623
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,600
see that the Delta I the change in

624
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:24,440
current upon exposure is huge the

625
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,840
shallower the homo I have because I'm

626
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,960
effectively doping it uh better and

627
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,440
therefore the conductivity goes up to

628
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,360
finally close that Loop using perovskite

629
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,720
as the iodine source so if I have this

630
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,440
stack here and what I'm what I'm

631
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,559
checking here is the conductivity of the

632
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,240
organic Bridge we can see the same Trend

633
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:48,360
so if I irradiate the perovskite and

634
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,440
then I shut off the irradiation what

635
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,919
happens is the I can measure the

636
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,080
transport of the organic which in the

637
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,520
absence of light is way more conductive

638
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,279
than the perovskite the perovskite is

639
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,840
very photo conductive Ive but actually

640
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,640
in the dark it's very insulating and so

641
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,200
I can actually look at the transport in

642
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,919
the organic and I can see the same Trend

643
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,039
iodine is leeched out from IR radiation

644
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,279
photolysis of the perovskite and I can

645
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,640
see this change in conductivity in that

646
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:20,919
organic whole transport

647
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,000
layer okay so um I still have some time

648
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:27,120
here so what happens when iodide is

649
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,240
oxidized so we unfortunately figured out

650
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,440
that there's also a Catal IC cycle that

651
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,960
can go on between iodide oxidation and

652
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,200
the organoammonium

653
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,840
cation in the hybrid organic inorganic

654
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,039
perovskites and it goes something like

655
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:49,000
this if you have your um halide

656
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:52,519
perovskite then I at some point will

657
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,200
oxidize iodide any oxidized iodide in

658
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:58,200
this in the presence of other Lattis

659
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,559
iodide will basically make triiodide and

660
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,640
fortunately as I'll show in the next

661
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,200
slide triiodide is a strong enough base

662
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,919
to deprotonate either formamidinium or

663
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,159
methylammonium in the case of for

664
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:12,159
amidinium I break it down into hcn and

665
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,200
ammonia in the case of methylammonium I

666
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:19,120
break it down into methylamine and um

667
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,519
the uh the subsequent hi is the final

668
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,399
product and then I make hi3 this is not

669
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:29,120
a very stable product and So eventually

670
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:31,200
I make hi and I2 and I2 in the presence

671
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,039
of more iodide I just make triiodide

672
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,640
again and so I have this unfortunate

673
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,360
catalytic cycle only one has to happen

674
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,919
and it just keeps going and yes this one

675
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,679
will actually make if I if I do this in

676
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,559
the presence of methylammonium I will

677
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,760
see lots of lead zero and that's because

678
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:49,679
of this amine which is a reducing agent

679
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,960
toward lead and so you will see lead

680
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,600
zero upon this catalytic reaction if you

681
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,919
have methylammonium

682
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,840
around so here's what happens if I have

683
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,200
Fai and and I put a little bit of iodine

684
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,360
in the solution I will make fa

685
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,200
triiodide and that induces the formation

686
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,080
of this type of species here which

687
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,399
basically forms a six-membered ring

688
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,840
encompassing the formamidinium cation

689
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,600
and triiodide and in the case of

690
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,600
methylammonium it's effectively uh in

691
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,519
both cases they're hydrogen bonded very

692
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,799
strongly hydrogen bonded and

693
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:30,039
unfortunately so strongly that uh with

694
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:33,640
time this leads to the the the breaking

695
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,440
of this complex into uh the constituent

696
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,360
components that I showed you this

697
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,279
ultimate

698
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,720
deprotonation and unfortunately for fa

699
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,200
when I deprotonate it it's complete

700
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,200
degradation the B the products that fa

701
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,799
deprotonation forms cannot reform form

702
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,679
aminium with methylammonium

703
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,760
actually if I make methylamine in hii it

704
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,840
there's a pretty strong push toward

705
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,600
reforming the methylammonium but not in

706
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,559
the case of fa that's

707
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,559
that's a one-way Street to to being

708
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,799
degraded so we asked the question if we

709
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,039
could stop this cycle and the the

710
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,279
effective the the most effective means

711
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:14,840
that we saw was could we put something

712
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:18,279
here something there that could act as

713
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:21,840
an iodine reductant so if iodide is ever

714
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:24,559
oxidized could it just interrupt it we

715
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,880
know there's one silver not a good one

716
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,200
because we don't want silver entering

717
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,640
the lattice maybe there's another system

718
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,519
that we could use as like this

719
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,600
intermediate to if any Ox iodide is

720
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,880
oxidized maybe it will push it right

721
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,399
back to

722
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,720
iodide and we drew inspiration from

723
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:48,519
actually biochemical processes

724
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:51,880
where thols are uh pretty good reducing

725
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:55,639
agents and what we wanted to do was

726
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,679
actually uh see if we could use thols to

727
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:01,080
reduce iodine and then make the

728
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,760
disulfide compounds and therefore

729
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,120
interrupt this catalytic

730
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,519
cycle and as as one thing that I want to

731
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,120
show you just because it's nicely

732
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,480
drawing out from what I what I showed

733
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:17,039
you a few slides back if I take a system

734
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,360
like Spyro with an iodide perovskite I'm

735
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,279
showing here again that iodine can leech

736
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,440
into the spiral layer you see this black

737
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:28,799
Trace is the iodine that has really uh

738
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,360
infiltrated the Spyro and if I put this

739
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,039
thol between Spyro and the perite you

740
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,440
can see that the iodine and Lead traces

741
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,120
follow each other very well and that's

742
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,679
because it's actually holding back the

743
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,080
iodide from being uh infiltrated because

744
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,039
it's never actually getting uh

745
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,840
oxidized without being just reformed

746
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:55,440
into iodide through the action of this

747
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,440
thol

748
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,919
compound it doesn't appear to compromise

749
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,880
the performance of the systems which is

750
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,880
good um it it might improve it but

751
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,919
statistically let's just say it doesn't

752
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,159
HT it which is already a good thing and

753
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,600
this is really just a vanishingly thin

754
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,000
coating of this thol compound which we

755
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,679
only tried three of them um whether this

756
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,159
R Group is methoxy or hydrogen or

757
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,679
Florine um it appears to sort of

758
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,360
preserve the performance of these

759
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,279
devices which is which is great um if we

760
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,600
look at the the stability we can see

761
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,279
that a few of them particular the either

762
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,279
the

763
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:39,919
fluorinated um the fluorinated compound

764
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,360
um or the methoxy compound are pretty

765
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,039
good at preserving the stability even at

766
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,399
85c which uh some of the these

767
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,000
cross-sectional analyses show really

768
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:54,039
allows iodine to permeate that spiral

769
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,360
layer but some of these Fales kind of

770
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,840
hold that permeation back and therefore

771
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,320
hold some of this degradation

772
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:05,440
um back as well and I think a lot of the

773
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,799
Spyro uh instabilities thermal

774
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,840
instabilities I know there's been some

775
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,919
work from mji Bend's group on this I

776
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,799
think a lot of its sources from iodine

777
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,480
infiltrating that system and interacting

778
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,919
with some of the other uh stuff in the

779
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,919
spiral layer so maybe one one solution

780
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,440
might be remove some of those additives

781
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,399
another solution is just don't let

782
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,960
iodine to enter it in the first place uh

783
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,279
and maybe doing both is is the sort of

784
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,720
better solution uh but I to my knowledge

785
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,559
that hasn't been attempted what we've

786
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,799
done is we've looked into trying to

787
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,880
replace Spyro with other compounds and

788
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,519
in this case we took this pretty

789
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,519
well-known whole transport layer from

790
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,519
the OLED field and it's readily doped by

791
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,679
Molly oxide it's also readily doped by

792
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,760
iodine but if we if we co- evaporate

793
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,799
this compound empty data with Molly

794
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:01,480
oxide we strongly P do it and we also

795
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:04,360
increase its its density and uh the

796
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,720
action of sort of pre-doping it with mly

797
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,280
oxide really holds back a lot of iodine

798
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,599
if you look at the Spyro system up here

799
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,440
you can see that the reason why it's on

800
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,359
the top of this waterfall plot is

801
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,280
there's so much iodine that's in that

802
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,839
system and you can see after analing a

803
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,320
lot more of it but if I take something

804
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,240
that holds back iodine in this case this

805
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,679
this composite of empty data and Molly

806
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,679
oxide you can see that it manages to

807
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,879
keep in check the iodine in that whole

808
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,960
transport layer and as such it can

809
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:38,000
really withstand substantially more

810
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,119
stress at higher temperatures so 60c

811
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,119
isn't enough to do much but 70c is

812
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,119
already enough to absolutely uh destroy

813
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,280
the Spyro the conventional doped Spyro

814
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:52,639
system and uh I I think that has a lot

815
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,560
to do with with iodine oxidation and and

816
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,920
infiltration into these

817
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,760
media so what about doping this is the

818
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,960
last part of my talk here um that should

819
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,200
be easy right as just a reduction

820
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,560
reaction um and ideally it's an

821
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,359
irreversible one and this this is one

822
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,880
nagging issue this

823
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:16,800
irreversibility um because perovskites

824
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:20,440
do feature ion migration and those a lot

825
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,280
of ions will just come in and change the

826
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,800
they'll kind of be be a sort of anti-c

827
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,280
correlating species to if you want to

828
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,440
affect change say dop it something else

829
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,640
will come in and just stymy that that

830
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,119
potential uh reaction and this is a lot

831
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,920
this has to do a lot with with our lack

832
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,359
of substantial success with doping per

833
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,320
op skites in general um the way we

834
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,880
started down this path was with using

835
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,440
molecular oxidants this is a well-known

836
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,960
one this Molly tfd compound strong

837
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,000
oxidizing agent what we see is that

838
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,160
putting this on the surface does in fact

839
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,240
make a much deeper work function but you

840
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,800
can see the conductivity of the system

841
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,839
is basically unchanged and so what has

842
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,480
happened with such a system is I'm

843
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,720
doping it but I'm just doping the

844
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,400
surface it's not doing anything to the

845
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,440
bulk properties of the perovskite and so

846
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,839
the picture I can draw and you can see

847
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,599
the the bulk actually the the XPS shows

848
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,040
uh even the core levels are shifting not

849
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,440
just the work function but everything is

850
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,119
really shifting so the system the

851
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,760
surface is really getting ptype doped

852
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,720
but it's not infiltrating the bulk and

853
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,000
so it's just a surface doping

854
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,079
nevertheless you can make a really close

855
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,599
analogy with a type of early silic solar

856
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,040
cell the the the screen printed aluminum

857
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:44,480
BSF solar cell back surface field and

858
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,599
the back here is basically p-doped and

859
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,480
it does promote whole collection so

860
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,040
devices are are actually aided by

861
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,720
putting a little p dooped back surface

862
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,359
on an nip type structure it's not it's

863
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,960
not necessarily a bad thing but it

864
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,680
doesn't really get to the core of of

865
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,520
true doping so then we tried using

866
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,760
cesium Le bromide nanocrystals see if we

867
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,640
could dope those through

868
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,200
electrochemistry the way this works is

869
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,560
pretty simple you put your cesium Le

870
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,920
bromide nanocrystals on a Surface in

871
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,839
this case I you immerse it in an

872
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,079
electrolyte uh in this case I think it

873
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,319
was uh

874
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,560
tea I forget pf6 I can't remember the

875
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:30,000
the counter C the counter anion um but

876
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,400
you inject electron from the I electrode

877
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,319
and every time you inject an electron

878
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,520
you attach one of these uh bulky

879
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:40,760
ammonium cation to the surface and

880
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,240
that's electrochemical

881
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,400
doping we were very careful not to go

882
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,319
beyond the electrochemical stable window

883
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,280
in the case of cesium Le bromide for us

884
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:53,160
that was about minus .9 volts to.5 volts

885
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,520
if you push Beyond it you see all kinds

886
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,319
of electrochemistry unfolding and you

887
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,040
are reducing lead you see lead zero in

888
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:02,880
the system you are evolving bromine um

889
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,400
so that's not a good idea but if you

890
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,440
stay within stabil the stability window

891
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:12,560
you can see a sort of nicely reversible

892
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:15,280
cycling and you can get real change here

893
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,280
you can get work function to the tune of

894
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,839
of shifts half more than half an EV um

895
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,680
and it's also seen in the core levels

896
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,079
not just the work function this is work

897
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,839
together with antoan Khan who's an

898
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,839
expert on electron spectroscopy and dop

899
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,680
and you can also see changes to

900
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,800
conductivity so you could see about a

901
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,440
factor of 20 increase in conductivity

902
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,040
when I end do the system and that was

903
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,040
that was coming together with an

904
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,280
increase in pl we said oh this is great

905
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,200
this is going to make this is going to

906
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,119
allow us to make a great led a great

907
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,880
laser diode we've end oped this system

908
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,359
um the pl got brighter that's great and

909
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,440
unfortunately also the lifetime got

910
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,319
longer and that's inconsistent with radi

911
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,319
creative re combination if I'm doping

912
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:03,640
this system if I'm adding electrons to

913
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:07,119
it free electrons to it my lifetime

914
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,640
should go down when my PL goes up but we

915
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,560
did not see that we saw that PL went up

916
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,640
and lifetime also went up and so what we

917
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,960
what we suggest it's hard to know but

918
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,839
what we think is that the injected

919
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,319
electrons are actually filling traps and

920
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:23,040
our increase in conductivity is actually

921
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,359
more or less an increase in Mobility

922
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,720
because we're basically making the

923
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:28,040
system a better electron transporter

924
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,400
we're not actually

925
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,200
adding free electrons to that system so

926
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,720
back to square one it's really hard to

927
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,200
dope these systems um so we went back to

928
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,240
this device and we thought more about

929
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,920
Metal

930
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,520
infiltration and we wanted to see if

931
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,480
every time a metal cation enters this

932
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:52,960
lattice do I actually end do it is that

933
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,960
the other side of the redox

934
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,599
equation we uh got the aid of leor

935
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,839
chonic at the white Institute in Israel

936
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,480
they did some density functional theory

937
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:05,640
on a gold interstitial and what they

938
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,839
found was that the gold interstial

939
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,000
transition level sits somewhere in the

940
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,599
conduction band in other words or and

941
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,800
right at the edge in other words if you

942
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,960
do have a gold plus

943
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,040
interstitial it should come along for

944
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,760
the ride with an electron that should be

945
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:26,880
the kind of stable state of a gold plus

946
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,839
interstitial and the the the the system

947
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,640
will ALS also end up changing the the

948
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,880
iodide transition will also go from

949
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,920
minus to plus and that'll come along for

950
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,040
the ride as well so you're going to

951
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,760
change the interstitial population of

952
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,440
iodide but you also add electrons to the

953
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,920
system and that's basically coming along

954
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,800
with the change of fmy level will shift

955
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,680
my interstitial population of iodide

956
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,800
from maybe some plus some minus to the

957
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,079
primarily minus along with free

958
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,160
electrons in the system so that's what

959
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,000
that's what their calculations indicated

960
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,920
and so we conducted these

961
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,599
very very simple uh tests this is

962
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,720
looking at current as a function of time

963
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,680
for different step UPS in the voltage

964
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,359
and what we saw was that initially we

965
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,800
had reasonable conduction and we thought

966
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,520
this was initially ptype conduction the

967
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,240
familyy level that we typically measure

968
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,640
of metal methylammonium Le iodide on fto

969
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,480
the familyy level sits slightly in the

970
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,839
ptype range and so it's consistent with

971
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,200
some kind of ptype hold dominated

972
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,640
conduction initially and then as a

973
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,880
function of time you can see that

974
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,240
eventually the conduction goes down and

975
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,040
I go through this plateau and we think

976
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,359
this is where you're basically

977
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,960
compensating that semiconductor so had

978
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:45,920
an initial hole population every time I

979
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,720
inject an uh gold interstitial I also

980
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,760
inject an electron and that is

981
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,800
compensating the system it's becoming

982
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,440
basically insulating you can see my

983
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,000
current falls off and then eventually my

984
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,280
current comes back up when I achieve n

985
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,040
type doping and that was consistent with

986
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,640
uh the the impedance analysis that we

987
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,960
did as well uh so this what we think is

988
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,000
happening you have initially ptype

989
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,880
conduction then the system becomes

990
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,920
compensated and then eventually you get

991
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,920
an N type medium and the

992
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,160
photoluminescence that I show that that

993
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,520
I'm not going to show here also agrees

994
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,200
with this we get PL that uh sort of goes

995
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,520
down when I enter this compensated

996
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,359
region when bimolecular recombination is

997
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,559
really bad right when I have almost no

998
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,760
electrons or holes around you see that

999
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,440
that uh low in conductivity is also

1000
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,839
Associated to a low in

1001
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,839
PL and so in conclusion um I I I would

1002
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:45,280
really encourage you to treat perovskite

1003
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:47,559
devices as electronic devices and

1004
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,079
electrochemical cells in order to go

1005
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,960
beyond the term ion migration and really

1006
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,640
try to understand these systems at their

1007
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,599
core um and stabilizing and doping these

1008
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,839
materials presents a major challenge but

1009
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,280
I think if if if we can adopt in Earnest

1010
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:05,319
this type of approach I think we can

1011
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,920
make some some real change and and

1012
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:09,440
progress um with that I'd like to thank

1013
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,119
the some of the agencies that helped

1014
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,079
fund this the department of Energy's e

1015
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,280
wing as well as the Office of Naval

1016
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,200
Research and finally thank you for your

1017
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,200
attention thank you thank you

1018
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,800
very thanks for a great talk so we have

1019
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,359
time for few questions uh if you have

1020
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,880
questions we have microphones we'll pass

1021
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:36,640
them around and and online if you have

1022
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,640
any questions please type your

1023
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,400
questions um I'm going to take you up on

1024
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,760
the second point there uh or no the

1025
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,640
first point there that they go Way

1026
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,800
Beyond um ion

1027
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:56,680
migration um 50 years ago I did a lot of

1028
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,119
work in Al halides not profes but Al

1029
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,720
halides

1030
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:04,240
trying to uh dope them with excess

1031
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,359
hallogen and that was done principally

1032
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,359
with potassium iodide dope with iodin

1033
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:12,319
under extremely high

1034
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:15,319
pressures and one gets the same um

1035
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:19,400
intertial type populations that one does

1036
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:24,480
with the radiation of alkal halides and

1037
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:29,680
what that shows is that the um the

1038
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:33,640
iodine um in this case um uh binds with

1039
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,760
the cat the annion at the annion sites

1040
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,119
and forms

1041
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:45,359
molecular interstitials so your I3 minus

1042
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:48,880
actually uh is uh really uh a um an

1043
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:52,559
intertial which is actually attached to

1044
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:56,839
lce ion and yes it's essentially split

1045
00:44:52,559 --> 00:45:00,319
interstitials round aat ofite um also

1046
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:02,359
the system generates um cation and

1047
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,160
annion

1048
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:08,160
vacancies uh and um these and that's

1049
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,119
because of the pressure of the iodine

1050
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,839
what happens is the interstitials

1051
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:18,440
actually can occupy um at whatever

1052
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:21,559
temperature um this is this is done at

1053
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,520
um annion and cation vacancies it's a

1054
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:26,640
way of actually stabilizing that

1055
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,640
interstitial population um which leads

1056
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,480
to the form of dislocation Loops which

1057
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,760
in fact are found in the potassium

1058
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,480
iodide which has been heavily doped with

1059
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,319
iodine so what I'm suggesting here is it

1060
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,359
not only goes a long way Beyond ion

1061
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,880
migration but it gets into the realm of

1062
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,520
extremely complex defect structures in

1063
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,200
ionic systems and I think you have to be

1064
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,680
aware of this um you can try to identify

1065
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,839
the species but you can only really

1066
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,680
understand the species of defects you

1067
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:01,000
have in the system which also can lead

1068
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,760
to the transport phenomena you see um if

1069
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,480
you think about the reaction with the uh

1070
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,440
Cs and anions and other defect

1071
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:14,200
populations in your perovskites it's a

1072
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,480
very complicated system and uh uh but

1073
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,559
and I resonate with your first point

1074
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,079
there but I think it has to be done

1075
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,520
there has to be a lot of defect

1076
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,559
spectroscopy done here to really

1077
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,359
understand um what's happening in this

1078
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:30,800
system it doesn't change the calculus of

1079
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:33,119
what you know charges transport and so

1080
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,480
forth but it does change the way you

1081
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,400
think about the diffusion of these

1082
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,440
defects a lot I'd like to pick your

1083
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,280
brain about what type of spectroscopy

1084
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,119
would be you know identifying these

1085
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,559
defect levels because they are six seven

1086
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:52,040
orders of magnitude below the lce sight

1087
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,480
density epr is one of them of course and

1088
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:58,440
and and there's been some work done with

1089
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:01,280
NMR of course as well see um um I don't

1090
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:06,079
know if these are transparent at all but

1091
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:08,760
um in any in any uh wavelength between

1092
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,760
infrared and

1093
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,280
UltraViolet and if if they are you can

1094
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,880
actually do some color under

1095
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,119
spectroscopy but my guess is you may not

1096
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,559
be able to do that yeah yeah I think one

1097
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,960
of one of the main concern one of the

1098
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,559
main issues not concerns one of the main

1099
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,480
issues with these systems that they tend

1100
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:28,839
to actually be relatively defect immune

1101
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,839
which means

1102
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,359
means non-native species or native

1103
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:38,400
defects don't tend to occupy electronic

1104
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,559
sites within the Gap so they tend not to

1105
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,599
be visible and your your primary

1106
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,839
exitation event is still that of the Gap

1107
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,480
and and and that's kind of what makes at

1108
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,280
least in in our experience direct

1109
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,200
measurement Elusive and so we've had to

1110
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,119
turn to close to the conduction or

1111
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:59,119
veillance bands yes okay yes yeah and

1112
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,440
that has made for us at least direct

1113
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,599
measurement Elusive and then we've sort

1114
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,800
of had to just kind of interpolate it

1115
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,800
okay good yeah I have other

1116
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:14,559
questions

1117
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,240
questions okay Barry maybe you can

1118
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,599
comment on your choice of the thile

1119
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,200
molecule and you mentioned you've tried

1120
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:28,400
three two three of them what goes into

1121
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,160
selecting the right material you

1122
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,480
know it was so we worked together with

1123
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,640
Jeff Schwarz now in ameritus faculty of

1124
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,839
chemistry and he wanted something that

1125
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,000
was uh relatively thermally stable you

1126
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:41,079
know wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be

1127
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,240
a liquid at room temperature it be a

1128
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,520
solid at room temperature and also

1129
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:50,280
relatively small so that it wouldn't be

1130
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:52,200
this big uh sort of insulating monster

1131
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,680
between the transport layer and the

1132
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,400
perov skate and we decided and we also

1133
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,319
want it to be commercially available so

1134
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,839
we decided on these compounds as being

1135
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:03,880
kind of like a neat compromise and there

1136
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,599
was also rather synthetic differences in

1137
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,920
them like the art the AR could be

1138
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,839
swapped out again commercially there has

1139
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,160
since been some work we tried we tried

1140
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,960
alkal thyes we those are obviously

1141
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,559
readily commercially available but they

1142
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,400
we didn't have much success with them we

1143
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,079
think they just make a relatively large

1144
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,400
insulating barrier and the the

1145
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:23,000
processing window for those to be

1146
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,920
successful might just be very small but

1147
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,319
the there was recent work from Alex

1148
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,559
Jen's group at Hong Kong where they

1149
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,720
where they found a thol that you know I

1150
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,319
think works better than the one that we

1151
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,000
showed and they and they they ascribe

1152
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:39,280
the success to a similar thing it kind

1153
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,119
of mediates iodide oxidation um sort

1154
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,119
interrupts it I would say it reduces it

1155
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,000
back and I I we haven't tried that one

1156
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:48,240
in our lab but I'd be curious to attempt

1157
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,400
that one because your I mean the catalog

1158
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,119
of thols is enormous enormous and so it

1159
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:56,880
would be it's very challenging to try to

1160
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,799
identify uh which one to use

1161
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,559
great any questions from the

1162
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:06,400
audience sure any questions online okay

1163
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:11,040
if not we do have a reception let's

1164
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,040
thank Professor rant again thank you

1165
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,040
all thank you Barry so we we're going to

1166
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,520
have a reception so so please stay back

1167
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,040
and Professor Rand will be here to

1168
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,720
answer any questions you have or if you

1169
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,720
want to talk one onone
