2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,600
it's a hard thing it really takes your

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,600
measure to be a part-time physician

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,519
that's not a job you want to do anything

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,360
less than your absolute best but one of

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,040
the things that I think lets me do

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,920
science better is because I'm a

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,000
physician every question that I've

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
chosen to pursue is deeply informed by

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,320
what I see in the clinic whatever I had

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,160
learned about an illness during the med

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,320
school years it was so much more

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,199
crystallized when I had a patient in

14
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,199
front of me who had it when I did and I

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,679
had a face and a set of feelings to

16
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,510
connect that to they just stayed with me

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:37,360
so much

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,559
more I lead a lab that's now eight

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,719
people and we study antibiotic

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,039
resistance and sepsis we study both

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,399
mechanisms of antibiotic resistance we

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,160
try to develop molecular Diagnostics and

24
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,520
apply them to to Patient samples for

25
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,000
antibiotic resistant bacteria and we

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,920
study the immune disregulation that

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,800
occurs in patients with

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,040
sepsis

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,479
I grew up in the Chicago area I was born

30
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,360
in the western suburbs a town called

31
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,840
neille Illinois my parents were both

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,560
scientists and so I'd often go into my

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
mom's lab I was mostly like bouncing a

34
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,159
tennis ball off the walls or doing

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
whatever reading I could do but I do

36
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,840
remember getting the sort of energy of

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
the lab I don't think it was until

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,600
junior year in college that I first

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,159
heard that mdphd programs even existed

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
pretty much as soon as I heard that I

41
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,600
thought well that that's it that's what

42
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,560
I want to do towards the end of my res y

43
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,720
I had a decision to make about where to

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,320
do fellowship and I hadn't actually done

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,320
any genomics at all but I could see the

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,560
power of it and I felt like we need to

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,040
bring this sort of

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,119
sequencing technology in a in an

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,439
informed and sort of clever creative way

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,079
into the understanding of infections and

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,960
the bro was at the

52
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,200
Forefront I connected with Deb hung who

53
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,960
was a core faculty member here at the

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
bro and eventually my postto adviser and

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,039
really it was you know sitting and

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,600
chatting with her that got me really

57
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,880
excited we started to drill down into

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,039
specific specific projects that could do

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,960
this and what I thought was a really

60
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,920
cool way not just to understand disease

61
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,599
better but also really to make the full

62
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,039
transition from things that we learned

63
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,840
at the bench actually affecting patient

64
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,720
care I saw the possibility of that in

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,800
those conversations what I've seen of

66
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,599
the broad is absolute cuttingedge

67
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,120
Technologies but applied to questions uh

68
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,319
that are really fundamentally important

69
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,840
to human health our societies have been

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,800
shaped by infections and I I find that

71
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,760
really fascinating and I find trying to

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,760
understand that a really interesting

73
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
thing
