1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
a lot of you um you're interested in

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,640
knowing not only what we're expecting to

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,599
see in the application components but

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,480
again how the the whole admissions um

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,280
process works and I think you know this

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,640
is something that we talk a lot about um

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,400
and it can be viewed in a sense of being

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,960
um a little bit of a cliche but we

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,000
really do take a very holistic approach

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,640
to the evaluation or admissions process

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
when we're considering candidates um

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,079
meaning that we look at all pieces of

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
your application and we use them to

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,800
better understand who you are as an

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,040
applicant. Um we are looking for

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,879
students who are missiondriven. Um

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
students who have a history of academic

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,320
success. So if you look in terms of this

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,879
first group being um I will mention and

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,879
pull out that mathematics or elemental

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,360
fundamental mathematics in some of these

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,199
courses that are also what we ask about

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,039
in the application are going to be

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,520
really important and are going to help

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,280
to for you to be able to succeed in the

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
program because when you think about the

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,640
coursework and against again the rigor

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,560
of it um the the quantitative finance

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,720
courses and everything else that's built

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,600
in you're going to be doing a lot that

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,240
will draw upon any of your knowledge in

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
these fundamental mathematics. Um,

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,320
computer programming again it is not re

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,600
it is not required but it's highly

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,920
recommended that you have some

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,759
familiarity and this is at a basic level

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
in Python. We're also going to teach you

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,799
Python as part of the course. Um, and

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
then STEM backgrounds or disciplines. So

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,479
the science, technology, engineering,

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,880
mathematics students have found that

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,000
that has really been helpful to them in

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,640
thriving and doing well in the program.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,320
um coming with some background in

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
finance, statistics, accounting and

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,759
economics is also really valuable. And

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
then as we think about you know what why

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
would you want to pursue a master of

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,600
finance or an MIN program you know

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,759
certainly having some work and or

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,079
internship experience in the field or

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,439
related is beneficial but let me

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,680
emphasize this it is not required.

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,680
Um, we're looking for individuals again

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,239
who have those strong academic records

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,120
and are good problem solvers. We can

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,680
teach you finance. So, um, I think

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,800
that's important to note here. Um but

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,760
understanding of finance career paths is

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,480
also extremely helpful for us to be able

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,879
to to see what is your passion for the

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,360
field, what is your motivation, how do

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,920
you want to make an impact, and then

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
last but not least, um excellent

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,160
communication and interpersonal skills.

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,879
um written and spoken English language

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,680
if English is not your native language

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,480
um coming to MIT and expecting to be

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,800
able to learn it um once you get to

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,800
campus is is not going to work. You need

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
to really have those strong written and

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
communi uh spoken and communication

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,599
skills before you get to campus. uh team

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
player. Um it's a term that's thrown

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,160
around a lot, but we also want to know

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,319
not only how much you are um

77
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,560
participating as a team player on

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,440
whether it's university projects, work

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,159
projects, but also do you recognize the

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,480
successes of others on your team? Um how

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,640
do you demonstrate that? And really a

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,040
desire to become an active member of the

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,959
MIT Sloan classroom and community that

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,360
is integral. When we talk about it, we

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,200
talk a lot about the clubs, conferences,

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,959
other ways that you can engage in the

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
community and it is really a huge part

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,280
of your network that hopefully you will

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,120
take with you for a lifetime. So, you

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
put all this together, these are some of

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,680
the things that we're really going to be

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,080
focused on as part of admissions.

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,799
So, hopefully that's given you kind of

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
at a high level what we're looking for.

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
Here is the application checklist. We're

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,360
going to go through each of these one by

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,239
one. Um the deadline and let me just

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,120
mention this upfront is January 3rd for

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,879
anyone who is planning to enroll uh in

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,640
this July of 2025. Um what I will tell

101
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,840
you is that we do not have rolling

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,840
admissions. It's one cycle or one intake

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,000
and I promise you we do absolutely

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
nothing. I say this all the time when

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm out on the road talking to

106
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,080
prospective students. We do nothing with

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,840
your applications until after the

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,519
deadline of January 3rd. So, please do

109
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,120
not rush to submit your application

110
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,479
unless you feel that it's as strong as

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
it should be and that you've answered

112
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,560
all the questions and submitted all the

113
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,800
documents. That being said, though, if

114
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,639
it's ready in 2 weeks and you want to

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,880
submit it, absolutely go right ahead and

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,120
do that. But nothing will happen to your

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
application. So, let's start going

118
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
through some of these application

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
components.

120
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Uh transcripts, of course, we want to

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
see, you know, as I mentioned earlier,

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
what are some of the things that we're

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
looking for? It's definitely the

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,080
strength of your academics and your

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,080
background. So, um, an important note

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,240
here or notes is that all applicants to

127
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,720
the program must hold a four-year at

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
undergraduate or bachelor's degree. We

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
know in some countries it's actually the

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
three years that you earn that um

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,199
undergraduate or bachelor's degree, and

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,199
that's fine. We accept them. You must

133
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,360
have completed all your undergraduate

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,759
and bachelor's degree requirements by

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
the time you start the program in July.

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,560
And this is very important because while

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,479
you may not in some cases there are

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,880
schools where you complete all your

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,840
degree requirements in time to start the

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,520
program, there may be an extra paper or

141
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,600
some other document that you need to

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280
submit and you may not have your trans

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,560
final transcripts until a little bit

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,160
later. That's okay as long as you are

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,720
not expected to go back and finish an uh

146
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,160
a paper um on your c you know

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,560
undergraduate campus or take a test or

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,840
um have to go back is not permitted. So

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,479
you will you absolutely cannot leave the

150
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,919
program once you started in July to go

151
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
back and fulfill your degree

152
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,199
requirements. So I just want to make

153
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,840
sure that's clear because it does come

154
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,400
up um a lot every year from prospective

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,240
students. So if this is not the case for

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
you, you may want to think about is this

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,080
the right year to apply and maybe think

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,000
about a ne the next year. Um these are

159
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
just some additional details. All of

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
this that I'm talking to you about now

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
and that we're going to be continuing to

162
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,759
review in this session are available in

163
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,000
the application itself. So you can see

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,240
all of these instructions and details. I

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,880
will tell you please please just follow

166
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,160
instructions, answer the questions. Um,

167
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,160
and if you have any specific situations

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,880
that you're unsure about, you absolutely

169
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,919
can write to us separately or questions

170
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,919
that are coming up now um, in the Q&A,

171
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,759
but please make sure to scan and upload

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,600
your transcripts from all colleges and

173
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,400
universities you attended or currently

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,120
attending. Um, we also want to make sure

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,039

academics or uh uh records or

185
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,960
transcripts, excuse me. And then once

186
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,039
you are admitted to the program, you

187
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
will be required to provide an official

188
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,479
signed and sealed transcript from all

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,720
the schools that you have attended. So

190
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,639
that is something that you know we'll do

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,720
um in addition to verifying anything

192
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
that you tell us in the application.

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,039
test scores. So, um I want to be clear

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,520
about this. While test scores are

195
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,039
important, um and certainly can be one

196
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,759
of the many different things that we're

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,680
reviewing, um it is optional for 2025 to

198
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,240
submit test scores. And this applies not

199
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,479
only to GMAT and GRE, but also to the

200
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,360
English language ability test, TOEFL and

201
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,680
IELTS. Um if you have a GMAT or GRE

202
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,360
score, certainly submit it. if you think

203
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,720
um it's an additional data point that

204
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
you would like the admissions committee

205
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,280
to consider. Um that being said though

206
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
again those without a test score will be

207
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,599
reviewed as is and there's absolutely no

208
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,080
negative inferences. We have a lot of

209
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,000
information about you um in terms of

210
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
your academic background and strength.

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
We're going to be looking at the courses

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
you've taken. We're going to be looking

213
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
at how well you've done in the u more

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
substantive and quantitative courses.

215
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,319
We're going to be looking at what your

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
academic recommenders, which we'll talk

217
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,599
about in a minute, are going to say

218
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,120
about you. So there are many different

219
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
components and aspects of your

220
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
background that will contribute to how

221
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,120
we view overall your academic strength

222
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
and whether you're going to thrive in

223
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
the program. Um we will accept

224
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,039
self-reported test scores by the

225
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,959
application deadline and welcome either

226
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,599
the traditional or online version of the

227
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,599
exams. Um please only input accurate

228
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
test scores. Do not use estimates or

229
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,160
approximations. Um that being said

230
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
though again with the application you

231
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,560
are going to self-report. If you do

232
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,480
submit GMAT or GE score GRE scores, you

233
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,480
are going to self-report them. We will

234
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,480
verify all that information later on.

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,640
So, employment and resume information.

236
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm going to actually turn this over to

237
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,200
my colleague Ally. She's going to talk

238
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,200
to you about this.

239
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,360
Hey Diane, sorry. Um I was thought I was

240
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,959
going to do um letters of bre. Okay,

241
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,880
I think the resume anyway. That's okay.

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,120
No worries.

243
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,480
Um, yeah, happy to talk about our um

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,399
employment and resume information

245
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,200
section. So, there are actually two

246
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,720
different areas on the application where

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399
um we do ask you about your past

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
employment. So, we're going to walk

249
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,920
through both of them right now. Um, the

250
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,440
first is the employment information

251
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,680
section. So, this is where we'll ask you

252
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,480
to list up to three of your most recent

253
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,399
employment experiences. Um, it's

254
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
important that these are verifiable. So,

255
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,800
it means that you must have been hired

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
by HR. If we contact um your employer,

257
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,399
they should be able to confirm that you

258
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,800
did in fact work there um and talk about

259
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,480
your experience there. Um in this

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,360
section, we ask that you only include

261
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,000
examples of um full-time or internship

262
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,360
experiences. Um and we define full-time

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,240
work as more than four months of paid

264
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,080
postderee work. Um, if you have

265
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
nonofficial work experience, um, for

266
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,680
example, if you weren't hired by HR,

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
maybe you were working with, um, you

268
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,279
know, a mentor, um, to do projects like

269
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,959
that, we do want to hear about that.

270
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,640
That it is of course very important

271
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,399
experience. Um, but we ask that you

272
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,240
include that on your resume or in other

273
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,200
points in the application and not in

274
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,440
this specific employment section. Um,

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,279
now in the resume, um, we ask that you

276
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
submit a one-page resume that follows

277
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,640
the following format. Um, we need it to

278
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,640
be in Times New Roman font. um uh size

279
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,480
10 and in word or PDF format only. Um

280
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
and you'll list your experience in

281
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,959
reverse chronological order. Um and this

282
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,720
is where you can include um other points

283
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
of reference um in addition to your

284
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,959
full-time and internship experiences.

285
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,800
So, of course, your education, um any

286
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,959
other work experiences you've had, as

287
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,399
well as additional information, any um

288
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,880
extra skills that you might have,

289
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,680
technical abilities, extracurriculars,

290
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,200
um that can all be on here as well. Um,

291
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,200
if you have any questions about how we

292
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,120
define some of these other sections, um,

293
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,680
there's a very detailed description on

294
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,519
the application itself, um, about how we

295
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,880
would define other work experiences,

296
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,800
additional information as well. So,

297
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,320
please do read that carefully, um, and

298
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,480
be sure to give us the information that

299
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,279
we are asking for.

300
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,920
Thank you, Hie. So, that was great. Um,

301
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,320
I think that hopefully we've made it

302
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,720
really clear. Um we've worked very hard

303
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,839
to ensure that people understand what we

304
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
mean by full-time work versus um you

305
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,040
know multiple part-time or internships.

306
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,320
And again um as Ally mentioned, it's

307
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,959
really important that um you make sure

308
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
that what when we do admit students, we

309
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,079
are going to verify all of your

310
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,880
information and it's important that

311
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,640
we're able to easily verify any kind of

312
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,120
internships or work experience that you

313
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,160
have provided in your application. So,

314
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,160
can't overemphasize that enough.

315
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,519
Okay, Ally, do you want to pick up here?

316
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,360
Yeah. Yeah, I'll keep going. Um, so for

317
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,800
letters of recommendation, I do know we

318
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
get a good amount of questions on our

319
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,079
letters of reck, so want to make sure

320
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,480
that we're really clear about um what

321
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,240
we're asking for. So, first and

322
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
foremost, every applicant should submit

323
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
three letters of recommendation. Um, if

324
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,639
you are currently a student while you're

325
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,639
applying, we ask that two letters come

326
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
from an academic source from your

327
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,399
current school. And one letter should

328
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
come from a professional source, um,

329
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
like a recent internship or a co-op, um,

330
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,200
preferably your most recent internship

331
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,880
or co-op experience. If you're applying

332
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
while you're working full-time, you

333
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
know, you've already graduated, um, we

334
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,399
understand that you may have, you know,

335
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
a bit of of a gap between, you know,

336
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,639
your past academic experience. And for

337
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,279
that reason, only one letter is required

338
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,959
to come from an academic source. Um, and

339
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,360
then one letter should come from your

340
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,440
most recent employer. And the third

341
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
letter is up to you. It can be from an

342
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,040
academic source or professional. Um,

343
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,560
whatever you think or whoever you think

344
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,160
will be able to best speak to your

345
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,079
abilities.

346
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Um, regardless of if you're applying as

347
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
a current student or working full-time,

348
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
it is important that at least one letter

349
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,600
come from someone that can speak to your

350
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,959
quantitative abilities. So, be sure to

351
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,760
consider that when you're thinking about

352
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,600
who you're going to be asking. Um, and

353
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
an additional note is that we do ask

354
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,240
that all letters be submitted using the

355
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,920
link provided in the application. Um, as

356
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,519
you're sending out your request, the

357
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,200
recommener will get a link sent to their

358
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,360
email and we ask that they use that link

359
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,480
to submit it and not just send us um,

360
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,480
you know, their letter to our email. Um,

361
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,360
a couple of tips to share about the

362
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,360
recommendation process. Um, first I will

363
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,440
note that you can see the questions that

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,760
your recommener will be asked when they

365
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,519
get the um request from you. So um take

366
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,519
some time to look over those questions

367
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,519
and think intentionally about who would

368
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,560
be a good person to ask who can actually

369
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,959
speak to all of those topics. Um, it may

370
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,120
also be helpful if you have time to meet

371
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,560
with your recommenders and talk about

372
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,480
um, you know, why you're asking them

373
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,000
specifically for a letter, why you want

374
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,079
to apply to the MININ program, what

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,440
you're hoping to gain from it. Um, and

376
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,720
just kind of walk through that whole

377
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
thought process with them so that they

378
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
might have more content for their

379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
letter. Um, especially if you're asking

380
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,920
a professor that maybe has a large class

381
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,440
or they haven't had contact with in a

382
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,959
little while, it's great to reconnect

383
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,240
and kind of remind them um, you know,

384
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,079
about who you are and have that

385
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
conversation so that they're able to,

386
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,000
you know, talk about you as accurately

387
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,920
as they can. Um, and this brings me to

388
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,920
my next tip, which is to ask your

389
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,760
recommenders for these letters as early

390
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,279
as you can. If you haven't started that

391
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
process yet, I would strongly encourage

392
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,000
you to do so. Um, they are busy people.

393
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
The deadline is approaching quickly. Um

394
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,600
and especially if you want to take some

395
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,360
time to uh you know sit down and talk to

396
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,360
them about this at all, you will need a

397
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,920
little bit of extra time. So would

398
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,839
encourage you to begin that process now.

399
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Um and then my last tip for letters of

400
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,639
recommendation is just a reminder that

401
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,639
we are not evaluating your recommener.

402
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,880
So there's a tendency I think for people

403
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,639
to want to ask someone that's high up at

404
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,800
their organization or you know the dean

405
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
of their school and even if they've only

406
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
met them a couple of times or you know

407
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,639
worked on one project with them. Um, and

408
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,040
at the end of the day, we're not looking

409
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,519
at the recommenders title, um, you know,

410
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,199
or who they are at the, um, company, per

411
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,800
se. We're looking at what they say about

412
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,040
you and how well they can speak to your

413
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,480
skills and your skill set. So, um, you

414
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
know, be intentional about who you're

415
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
asking. And, um, you know, if you work

416
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,360
at Amazon, we don't need Jeff Bezos to

417
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,279
write your letter. Please just pick

418
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,399
someone that can really speak to the

419
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,000
contributions you've made um, and get

420
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
help us get to know you as best as we

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
can.

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,399
Those are great tips. Yes. Thank you,

423
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,959
Ally. And I would also just add um I

424
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,959
know for some individuals if your um

425
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,199
recommener if English is not their

426
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,160
native language you know they may want a

427
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,680
little help but please you know try to

428
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,680
make sure that they're getting it

429
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,880
translated from someone else other than

430
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,639
yourself. I think's tip about, you know,

431
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,920
wanting to ensure that your recommenders

432
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,320
understand um beyond just the request

433
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,000
why you're asking them to provide the

434
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
information and answer those seven

435
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,880
questions that are really important for

436
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,720
us to because we look at everything. Um

437
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,399
but keep that in mind as well. So all

438
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,079
great tips. Thank you.

439
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,160
Okay, video.

440
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,519
Yeah, of course. So the video questions

441
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,839
also ones that we get a couple of

442
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,240
questions about every year. Um, so happy

443
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,800
to share more info on this too. So

444
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,399
really the videos are a chance for your

445
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,440
application to really come alive is how

446
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,040
we see it. Um, video one is just a

447
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720
chance for you to introduce yourself to

448
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,959
your future classmates. It's a chance

449
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,079
for us to really put a face to the name

450
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,320
of the application that we've been

451
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,920
reading, you know, so intensely. Um, and

452
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,320
have your personality really shine

453
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,079
through. So um, this video can be

454
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,759
conversational, relaxed. We want you to

455
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,199
be yourself. Um, again, you're

456
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,240
introducing yourself. So, what would you

457
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,720
share with someone if you were meeting

458
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,320
them for the first time? Um, it does not

459
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
need to be overproduced. You know, we

460
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
don't need movie quality videos here.

461
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,839
Um, you can definitely just be sitting

462
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,759
at your desk recording it with your

463
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,079
phone, camera, whatever is easy and

464
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,680
comfortable for you. Um, you are

465
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,440
welcome, if you choose to do so, to film

466
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
it in a different environment. Um,

467
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
however, we do ask that wherever and

468
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,199
however you record the video, please

469
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,959
follow the guidelines we share about,

470
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,120
um, you know, what the video should be

471
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,480
like. Um, so first and foremost, you

472
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,400
only have a minute for the video, so

473
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,039
it's relatively quick. You know, please

474
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,280
stay within that time frame. Um, please

475
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,959
let the video be all in one continuous

476
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,880
tape. So, don't edit together different

477
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,439
snippets of different videos. Um, it

478
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
should be one solid video.

479
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,880
Um, but the most important thing I would

480
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,880
say about the video is that we need to

481
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,960
be able to see and hear you very

482
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,280
clearly. So, um, please speak directly

483
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,799
to the camera and make sure that you're

484
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,039
in a quiet place with no background

485
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,440
noise or distractions. Um, there should

486
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,120
be no music that you put over the video.

487
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,799
Um, if you're filming outside, let's

488
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,720
say, there should be no wind that, you

489
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,480
know, we aren't able to hear you over.

490
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,679
So, um, before you submit it, please be

491
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,080
sure to watch it back and make sure that

492
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,360
we can see and hear you clearly. Um, we

493
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,280
just want to be able to, you know,

494
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,280
really meet you.

495
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,160
Um, one tip that I would share about

496
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,400
video one is that I think that you might

497
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,840
want to um, and absolutely can share and

498
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
talk about pieces that you know are

499
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,720
listed on your resume or experiences

500
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,720
that are touched on in other parts of

501
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,160
your application, but you also can use

502
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,840
the opportunity to talk about things

503
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,520
that maybe haven't been mentioned on

504
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,919
your application yet, like hobbies or

505
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,000
activities um, or other passions. So,

506
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,520
feel free to share um, those too in this

507
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,320
video. Again, it's an introductory

508
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,440
video, so we want to get to know you.

509
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,559
Um, video question two. Um, I will the

510
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
first thing I'll note is that video

511
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,400
question two does not appear in the

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,400
application until you're about 80% done

513
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,320
with it. So, it's kind of a popup that

514
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,320
appears, um, towards the, um, end of

515
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,120
your application. So, um, be on the

516
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,440
lookout for that tab to appear. Um, the

517
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,520
style of this video question is more of

518
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,640
a question and answer. So, you will be

519
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,720
presented with a prompt that is randomly

520
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,840
selected from a list of over 200

521
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,840
possible questions. Um, and once that

522
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,919
question appears, you'll have 10 seconds

523
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,760
to prepare a response and then you'll

524
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,600
have one minute to record your answer to

525
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,679
it, which the recording will begin right

526
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,960
after that 10 minute, sorry, 10 minute,

527
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,559
10-second um, preparation period. Um,

528
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,400
the question that will appear is not

529
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,960
going to be a technical question and

530
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,799
does not require preparation. Um, an

531
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,640
example might be something like, uh,

532
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,559
what's an article you've read recently?

533
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,480
Um, what was it about? How did it impact

534
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,720
you? So, there's not really a right or

535
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,720
wrong answer. We are just looking to

536
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,000
learn about how you communicate, how you

537
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,320
express yourself, what your thought

538
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,919
process might be. Um, and again, just a

539
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,760
chance for your application to come

540
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,120
alive and for us to get a better sense

541
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,039
of you as a person as a whole. Um, one

542
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,200
thing I will note about video question 2

543
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,880
is that before you record your response,

544
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,960
you do get to kind of go through a bit

545
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
of a test run. Um, make sure that your

546
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
video is recording properly, that your

547
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,080
microphone is recording properly, so

548
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,360
that there should be no technical

549
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,240
glitches. you'll get a good sense of

550
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,760
what the platform is like. Um so please

551
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,919
do use that test environment to make

552
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
sure that you feel um ready to move

553
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
forward and actually see the question

554
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,080
and start recording. Um this is because

555
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,480
you only have one attempt to record this

556
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,000
and we are unable to offer you a redo.

557
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,520
Um if there is a glitch or something

558
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,880
goes wrong. So please make sure that

559
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,799
everything is functioning properly

560
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,720
before you start to record. Something

561
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,000
doesn't look right, you can email us but

562
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
um you should be able to navigate

563
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,600
anything through that test environment.

564
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,120
make sure that your, you know, video is

565
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,120
clear, that there's no background noise,

566
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,799
your microphone's functioning, um, and

567
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,559
then record it because just like video

568
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,880
one, most important thing is that we're

569
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,000
able to see and hear you. So, um, please

570
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,159
just be sure that that is all

571
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
functioning properly before you record.

572
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
I think that's video question two.

573
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,159
Yeah, great. I mean, I love the fact

574
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,080
that we have these videos incorporated

575
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,640
into the application and you should see

576
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,280
it as a very positive way to a positive

577
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,000
aspect and component components because

578
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,640
it really is again, you know, how we're

579
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,320
able to really put a face with the name,

580
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,520
get to know your personality, let it

581
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,200
shine through. Um, and uh, it really is

582
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,760
again one of the, you know, things that

583
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,919
I think is um, a great way to express

584
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,360
yourself and it goes beyond just seeing,

585
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,760
you know, pieces of paper with writing

586
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,440
on it. So, thank you Ally for those. So,

587
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,520
let's talk about a couple of the short

588
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,039
answers. I'm want to be cognizant of the

589
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,039
time. So, I'm going to go through these

590
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,520
a little bit quickly. Um, but here's

591
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,440
another way that we want to be able to

592
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,760
get to know you a little bit better. Um,

593
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,159
each of you has your own journey and

594
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,000
story to tell. And so, we're going to

595
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,919
ask you how the world you come from has

596
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
shaped who you are today. You know, it

597
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,520
could include something about your

598
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,039
family, your culture, your community.

599
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,440
you know, what has helped to shape

600
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,000
aspects of your life experiences thus

601
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,480
far and your perspective. Um, it's

602
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,240
really um, again, another way for us to

603
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,559
get to know you a little bit better and

604
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,640
it really does speak to the things that

605
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,640
we look for um, from an admissions

606
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,600
standpoint is how much will you engage

607
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,600
in our community um, and the larger MIT

608
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,400
ecosystem.

609
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,960
And then we have a few um, what we call

610
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,960
professional questions. Um so just you

611
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
know discussing your past academic

612
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,039
professional experiences and

613
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
accomplishments um include achievements

614
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,400
and then we have a second question about

615
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,919
your short-term and long-term

616
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,080
professional goals. These are

617
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,000
non-binding. I promise you we are not

618
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,480
going to hold you to what you tell us in

619
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,039
these but it helps us again get a sense

620
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,200
of you know if you don't come from a

621
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,000
background of having some finance or

622
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,000
finance related courses or internships

623
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,240
what is it about you know the finance

624
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
field that interests you and the infant

625
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,159
degree and helping you to achieve those

626
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,080
goals and then the third one is what

627
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,000
personal qualities will enable you to

628
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,240
contribute to the advancement of our

629
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,159
mission um and the mission is really an

630
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,159
integral part of being at MIT

631
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,400
So, we've given you a lot of information

632
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,039
about the application and the

633
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,360
components. Um, some tips. I hope this

634
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,120
has been really helpful. Let me just

635
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,600
tell you what's going to happen next.

636
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,840
Um, so as I said, absolutely nothing to

637
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,280
your applications will happen before the

638
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,200
January 3rd deadline. January 4th, we

639
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
then have an admissions committee and

640
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,000
professionals who are going to review

641
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,840
applications. um a lot of you know what

642
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,520
we're going to be looking at is based on

643
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,679
all of the things that we've just talked

644
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,640
about. So everything in the application

645
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,880
all the components really are um you

646
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,120
know they're developed to measure your

647
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,080
attributes and that what we feel will

648
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,400
make you successful MFIN candidates. Um

649
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,039
and so we we really are interested in

650
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,039
knowing what you have done thus far. um

651
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,039
how are you looking towards the future

652
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,120
is certainly something where we also

653
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,799
want to know about but we also want to

654
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
make sure that you know what you've done

655
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,200
thus far is going to set you up for

656
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,919
success and to thrive in the Min

657
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,000
program. Interviews are by invitation

658
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,159
only. So once we review applications

659
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,240
then we make decisions and then then if

660
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,960
you're advancing you're going to be

661
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,799
required to um have an interview. They

662
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,880
will be conducted via Zoom. It's

663
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,440
typically one-on-one with an admissions

664
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,679
professional. Um, there will also be

665
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,120
some additional aspects to an interview.

666
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,919
You'll have to complete a virtual

667
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,480
quantitative assessment uh and submit a

668
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,880
pre-in essay question. All of the

669
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,679
details around this and the interview

670
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,159
you will receive um once you're notified

671
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,720
about an interview invite. So, the

672
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,720
interviews from a timing standpoint, I'm

673
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,880
going to share with you just what

674
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,039
everything looks like. Important dates.

675
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,039
Again, can't mention this enough, but

676
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,640
January 3rd is the deadline. make sure

677
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,279
everything is in by then, including the

678
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,159
letters of recommendation. Um, late

679
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,080
January to Febru February is when we

680
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,480
conduct interviews. So, it all happens

681
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,039
in a very um what I'd call condensed

682
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,440
time frame and they are all virtual um

683
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,000
on Zoom. And then we will let you know

684
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,919
our decision on the 7th of March and

685
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,080
then you will have until the 15th of

686
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,799
April um to let us know if you're

687
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,039
planning to enroll. And again, um it's

688
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,440
important that you apply in the year

689
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,480
that you intend to enroll. So we have

690
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,159
one intake cycle January 3rd, which

691
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,559
means that you're applying now in

692
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,559
January because you intend to enroll

693
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,720
when we start the program in July of

694
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,720
2025.

695
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,240
Okay. So with that I am going to stop

696
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,440
sharing and look to my colleagues to let

697
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,679
me know in the time that we have left if

698
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,440
there are any questions that um would be

699
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,919
great for the general population that we

700
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,919
should answer live.

701
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,840
I'm going to just scroll through some of

702
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,840
these too.

703
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,760
Everything's been answered. You guys are

704
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,760
great. You've been

705
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,000
Hi Diane. Um I do always I know we

706
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,080
always get this question, but uh we have

707
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
some questions about the West and if

708
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,520
people should use that to translate

709
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,159
their transcript or if there's any

710
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,799
preference and and how the process goes.

711
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,159
Yep. Yeah. No, we um absolutely have no

712
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,919
preference. Um Wes is fine. Uh as I said

713
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,000
though, you make sure you include both

714
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,840
the the transcripts in the original

715
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,880
language as well as the translated

716
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,200
version. Um some universities actually

717
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,799
provide that as a service to their um

718
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,720
graduates. So you might want to check

719
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,720
with your own school to see if that's

720
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,360
something they'll do for you. Um but

721
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,360
absolutely no preference.

722
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,679
And on that note, should people um

723
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
convert their GPA or give it as is in

724
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,120
the application?

725
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Yeah. No. Um it's a great question. So

726
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,960
no, you do not absolutely do not need to

727
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,880
convert your GPA. We have systems in

728
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,000
place for being able to do that. As you

729
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,679
might imagine, we get um applicants who

730
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,200
have graduated from universities all

731
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,760
around the globe, many different um uh

732
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,919
grading scales. Um so you absolutely do

733
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,840
not need to do that.

734
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,320
Great. And I know um you all went over

735
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,000
this very well, but um we've had a

736
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,080
couple of questions around any tips to

737
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,720
make folks stand out in their essay of

738
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,960
what they should include.

739
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,159
No, it's a great question. So, um, I,

740
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,320
you know, look, we want this to be about

741
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,400
you. This is your story. And so, what

742
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,799
we're looking for is authenticity. We're

743
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,279
looking for you to be genuine. Um,

744
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,200
there's a lot out there to tell you what

745
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,360
you're supposed to be doing when you

746
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
apply to schools and how you should be

747
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,120
answering, but you really want to just

748
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
tell your story. And keep in mind, you

749
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,679
know, you're applying for a master of

750
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,559
finance program, a highly specialized,

751
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,640
deeply rigorous program that's going to

752
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,400
set you up to launch a career, whether

753
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,799
it's in quantitative finance, financial

754
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,279
engineering, we're investment banking.

755
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,039
So, you want to make sure that you know

756
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,559
anything we need to know about what you

757
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,320
have done thus far that's going to

758
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,039
contribute and going to help us to

759
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,960
understand um everything about why you

760
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,480
are pursuing this master's degree is

761
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
really important. So, answer the

762
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,960
question. um is the best answer I can

763
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,919
give you. Make sure you're answering the

764
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,000
question that we we set up. Um but be

765
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,159
yourself. Be genuine. It comes through.

766
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,559
We know we're admissions professionals.

767
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,799
We, you know, we we understand when it's

768
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,480
really everything has to sort of connect

769
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,159
in terms of what your recommenders are

770
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,399
saying about you, what you're saying

771
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,240
about yourself, and how we're looking at

772
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,480
um all the materials and information you

773
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,600
provide us.

774
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,080
Thank you. Yeah.

775
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,440
Um Ally, this may be a good question for

776
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,640
you. So, it's about the relevant

777
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,039
coursework and professional

778
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,279
certifications piece of the application.

779
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,440
I I've seen a few questions asking, you

780
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,039
know, should they list it out as a truly

781
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,279
a list? Should they have a portfolio?

782
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,960
Should they share certifications? Do

783
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,880
they put that they've been on the deans

784
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,120
list? What what all are we looking for

785
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
in this section?

786
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
Yeah. So, there is a specific relevant

787
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,840
coursework section and that's kind of

788
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,039
the only place that we would ask that

789
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
you would list that. So, you'll be

790
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,039
asked, you know, do you have, you know,

791
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,559
a course taken in this subject? If yes,

792
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
please insert all the information about

793
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,640
that. So, that should certainly go

794
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,799
there. Um, you can also acknowledge if

795
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,480
you are, you know, on the dean's um

796
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,679
honor list or or, you know, whatever the

797
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,279
equipment will be at your institution,

798
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,279
that can also be listed on your resume

799
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,520
under your education section. So, that

800
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,440
can be included there. Um, there also is

801
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,200
a specific area for academic awards and

802
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,679
achievements. Um, I believe you can list

803
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,520
up to three. Um, so feel free to include

804
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,279
those there as well. There's a lot of

805
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,279
different spaces on the application and

806
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,640
I would encourage you to you know use

807
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,919
them all as best as you can um to take

808
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,679
advantage of all the space that we

809
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,440
offer. So um you know if there is an

810
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,600
academic award that you were able to

811
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,440
list um in the specific section then

812
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440
that can be maybe not on your resume to

813
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,640
make room for something else. So um you

814
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,840
know just be intentional about what

815
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,679
you're putting where and I'm sure

816
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,360
there's plenty of room to get um in all

817
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,440
the incredible things that you've done.

818
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Um, but yeah, I would just encourage you

819
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
to put it in the section that

820
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,640
specifically asking for it if you can.

821
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,520
Um, and if not, then hopefully there's

822
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,760
room on your resume as well.

823
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,760
Thank you. Um, we've gotten a couple of

824
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,480
questions, too, or Diane, if you saw one

825
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
you wanted to highlight.

826
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,279
Yeah, I was just going to actually No,

827
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,520
thank you, Katherine. This is great. So

828
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,399
I think um one question that I noted um

829
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,279
a couple questions actually one on um

830
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,200
the test scores which again are optional

831
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,039
um but certainly if you feel like it's

832
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,880
important to uh include it you

833
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,640
absolutely can do that and whether

834
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
there's a preference between the GRE or

835
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,600
the GMAT and the fact that we do list

836
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,159
the GRE it just happens to be that what

837
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,240
we have discovered um in the past you

838
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,520
know or more recent years is that the

839
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,440
most of MIN applicants actually submit

840
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,279
and seem to be gravitating ating towards

841
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,840
the GRE. And so it's just by mere fact

842
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,840
of the statistically the numbers are

843
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,440
really small for individuals who do

844
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,919
submit test scores and have taken the

845
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,080
GMAT. But we have no preference. So you

846
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,240
absolutely could submit either one. And

847
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,320
then I think there was one more that I

848
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,000
saw about part-time teaching

849
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,960
assistantships considered work

850
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,960
experience. Um, it really I mean it's

851
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,360
great if you have that experience, but

852
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,279
it's really not part-time again is not

853
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,799
necessarily something that we that you

854
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,279
would want to put in the employment

855
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,880
section. So, I would say for a teaching

856
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:12,640
assistantship um on your resume is is

857
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,240
probably the best place to put it.

858
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,120
Okay. Sorry, Katherine. Go ahead. Was

859
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,520
there another one?

860
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,279
Great.

861
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah. I I see a couple questions around

862
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,640
any tips and advice for relicants.

863
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,240
Yeah. No, great question. So, um

864
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,399
certainly, you know, one of the things

865
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,080
that we want to know about is what have

866
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,399
you been doing in the past year since

867
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,360
you last applied. Um you know, maybe

868
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,320
you've taken additional coursework. Um

869
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,039
I'm making it up now. Perhaps your um

870
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,360
coursework didn't include as many of the

871
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,919
relevant ones that we talk about or um

872
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,000
ask about in the application and you've

873
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,039
done something towards that um effort or

874
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,159
initiative. Um or perhaps you didn't

875
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,480
have any finance related coursework or

876
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,120
internships and you've been able to do

877
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,200
that either a summer or some other type

878
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,080
of work. Maybe you've even done research

879
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,000
with um within the field of finance. So

880
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,480
we're looking at what have you done in

881
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,640
the past year to further support your

882
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,720
background um and experiences that's

883
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,600
going to help you again to really thrive

884
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,600
in the Minim program. And if I can add

885
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,200
on to that also, Diane, um just noting

886
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,120
that the admissions committee will also

887
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,360
be able to see your prior application

888
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,880
too. So um you know when answering the

889
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,240
professional questions, let's say you

890
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,840
don't need to repeat exactly what you

891
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,919
said last time, even if your goals are

892
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,200
relatively the same. Try to share new

893
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,960
information because they will also be

894
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,039
looking at your past application. So you

895
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,440
kind of have double the space. Um so

896
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,519
just try to um share anything new or um

897
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,880
you know what's changed like they said.

898
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,720
Yeah. Yeah. Great.

899
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,840
We definitely probably take one or two.

900
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,279
Oh, sorry, Catherine. Go ahead.

901
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
No, yeah, yeah, we've definitely

902
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,120
answered a lot of questions. I'm just

903
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,120
scrolling through.

904
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,840
I do want to note we've had a few

905
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
questions about submitting some

906
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,960
components of the application after the

907
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,159
deadline, perhaps a letter of

908
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,679
recommendation or test score. Um, we

909
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,840
really would love for you to try to get

910
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,480
everything submitted um by the the

911
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,080
deadline date of January 3rd. um we

912
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,399
start reviewing the applications the day

913
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,159
after on January 4 and it's on a rolling

914
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,120
basis. So if we read your application

915
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,200
and completed it and pushed it on down

916
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,480
um we may not be able to you know go

917
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,559
back and review and add that

918
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,559
information. So uh as best as you can

919
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,799
and please try to have it um submit it

920
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,360
by January 3rd.

921
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,360
Yep. Great.

922
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,919
And this may be jumping ahead a bit. Um,

923
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,840
unless there's another question that we

924
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,159
see some, uh, people are asking about

925
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,760
the math evaluation test and tips for

926
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,120
the interview.

927
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,640
Yeah. So, well, again, once we establish

928
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,159
what those are going to be, I mean,

929
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,880
there'll be a little bit of math,

930
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,880
there'll be a little bit of coding, um,

931
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,440
but, you know, again, we'll confirm all

932
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,000
that once the interview invite um, is

933
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,320
extended. So, um, nothing to be overly

934
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,320
concerned about at this point. So,
