1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,359
okay so today we are going to cover a

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,480
topic which is quite unusual for 14 to

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,279
71 uh nonetheless it's quite important

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,800
it's about the views that people about

5
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,640
that people have about the morality of

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,000
markets um 271 is about antitrust mainly

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,760
and of course antitrust is about

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,920
market and if people don't believe in

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,600
markets um then that raises issues about

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
what we are doing in the first place

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,879
furthermore there are lot of development

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,120
nowadays actually it's broader than of

13
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:01,199
the trust about what independent agency

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,320
should be doing so that has started with

15
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,680
central banks um their mission of En

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,680
large is no longer just inflation

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,720
targeting and financial

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,799
stability but you know it goes Way

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,680
Beyond and now everybody talks about

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,439
green central banks and there is issue

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
about whether fighting the climate

22
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,079
change should be the responsibility of

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
the central bank or it should be the

24
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,600
responsibility of

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,200
Ministries um with antitrust it's a

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,600
little bit the same because there are

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,880
more and more discussions in particular

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,280
in Europe but you know all over the

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,439
world about whether the consumer

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,200
standard is the right way to proceed so

31
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,399
the consumer standard is basically that

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,680
the antitrust mission is to defend the

33
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,040
consumer maybe not the short-term

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,840
consumer maybe an intertemporal consumer

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,960
uh because sometimes you have tradeoffs

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,600
between today and tomorrow but you know

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,360
by and large the mission of of anti

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,960
trust authorities everywhere in the

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,759
world is to defend the consumer it's

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,079
it's pry clear

41
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,880
it's difficult in practice but you know

42
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,479
on paper it's simple you you just just

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,920
stand as an advocate for the for the

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,879
consumer but now people say no no no

45
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,200
maybe we should relax on the trust um

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,879
first for example when we choose

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,519
cases so if there is a caviar cartel and

48
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,599
a mil cartel then if you have limited

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,480
resources you first go after the the mil

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,280
cartel and the cavier cartel you just

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,519
say okay

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
this is not that important so we we

53
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,760
should take into account redistribution

54
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,440
we should take into account climate

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,080
change so if we have a cartel which

56
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,840
actually promotes the fight against

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,760
climate change maybe we should tolerate

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,720
the cartel and so on and so forth there

59
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,760
are lots lots of

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,400
discussions uh about that actually next

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,480
week I'm going to a conference

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,840
organizing by Margaret vager I'm giving

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,640
a Peyote there and you know the panel

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,480
just after me is exactly about this

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,879
topic with people like Tom philippo and

66
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,680
others it's it's really about this topic

67
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,879
so I would know more in a week from now

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,599
that's not going to help very much for

69
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,120
for today but uh you know that's really

70
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,239
important because in the end that's that

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,720
the mission in my own view i' I've I've

72
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,319
worked on Mission and advocacy with

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,400
Mattias and my own view is that it's not

74
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,280
always a good idea to have missions

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,319
Mission creep and if the issues are real

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,360
so inequality is real climate change is

77
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,120
real of course uh maybe it's

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,760
not say to the antitrust authority to

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,799
tackle them but actually more political

80
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,680
bodies should be doing that as opposed

81
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,040
to but that's my own view on on those on

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,360
those issues um but there's a broader

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,319
thing about whether we we like markets

84
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,439
and there's this bizarre thing um that

85
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:03,640
um almost every economy in the world is

86
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,879
a market economy and nonetheless nobody

87
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,360
likes market so here it's kind of

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,879
paradox somehow

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,200
um and

90
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,759
that's yeah I will come back to our to

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,880
to the big picture about how we think

92
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,479
about the organization of society but

93
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,280
you know it's it's kind of strange so

94
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,720
what I'm going to do is to have a brief

95
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,400
introduction about this and then switch

96
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,560
to a paper that I'm finishing the

97
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,000
revision I'm finishing with Mattias

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,960
the uh on the morality of markets but I

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,800
just want to have a broad picture first

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,840
I will go relatively fast because it's

101
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,440
developed in some detail in in economics

102
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,080
for the common good if you have seen

103
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,160
economics for the common good the book

104
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,880
um but you know you

105
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,840
you feel free to ask question actually

106
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:59,759
try to ask more question than you did on

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:02,039
Monday okay that's your mission um the

108
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,039
there there are two kinds of attacks

109
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,560
against

110
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,960
Market the first is that a number of

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,320
markets are what's called

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,320
repugnant so you know we we are we don't

113
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,360
feel very much at tease with those

114
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,880
markets and almost every well-known

115
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,280
philosopher has a book on that um you

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,880
know I put here de braat and Michael SLE

117
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,680
but there are many other well-known

118
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,560
philosophers who also have books on on

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,039
EX with rough the same title not the

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,160
same content because if you compare

121
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,319
those two books for example they they

122
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,800
they start from the same point of view

123
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,759
but you know they they have very

124
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,319
different

125
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,240
analysis um you know the the most

126
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,280
well-known one I mean this was a huge

127
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,120
best seller of Michael sandal uh you

128
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,919
know talks about all those markets that

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,120
make us uneasy you we do we have markets

130
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,160
for babies or you know whatever all

131
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,560
those things as are actually creating

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
some uh some conflicts in our brain

133
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,759
about whether we should have those

134
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
markets

135
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,360
now

136
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,000
um this this is more specific it's not

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,479
the market in general it's specific

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,599
markets that we don't quite like but you

139
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,759
know the the frontier is unclear so

140
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:29,400
number of people think for example that

141
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:34,400
uh tradeable emission permits Market you

142
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:37,080
know the ETS systems for carbon are

143
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,319
immoral they are immoral because you can

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,240
pay for the right to pollute or carbon

145
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,319
tax is the same you pay the carbon tax

146
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,240
and you pay for to pollute of course you

147
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,880
can ask you is that more more to not

148
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,199
have toay to pollute but and then then

149
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,280
there's a big silence in front but you

150
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,000
know lots of people in my experience the

151
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,599
last 30 years is that when you talk

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,400
about a carbon price it always sense but

153
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:07,639
it's IM M you talk to a minister and you

154
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,319
and but yeah you're right but it's IM

155
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:14,520
more and at a point of time you say okay

156
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:18,520
you prefer people polluting for free uh

157
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,080
is that more M but you know I don't know

158
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,720
and I think you know we are Economist

159
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,360
and we have to realize that in Civil

160
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,319
Society oh these are kind of strange

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,720
views as strange to some extent

162
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,160
um and the ideas are are really about

163
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Market incentive it's true that much of

164
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,520
the work we have done in the last 30 or

165
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,919
40 years how about basically when those

166
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,240
markets don't work and when the

167
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,039
incentives don't work uh so you know

168
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,639
they there's a huge number of papers on

169
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,840
why low power incentive scheme might be

170
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,720
desirable because you know you have no

171
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,000
easy performance measurement teamwork

172
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,000
which is a special case and think of

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,479
about Banks paper collusion with monitor

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,639
my work with my work on on capture

175
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,280
repeating interaction

176
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,759
multitasking uh asymmetric

177
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,280
information and so on and so forth so we

178
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,080
there's a huge number of of pieces of

179
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,919
theory which basically says you know low

180
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,520
power incentive scheme can be good

181
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,520
sometimes in specific

182
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,039
circumstances and same thing that number

183
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,360
of papers about the fact that incentive

184
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,159
can crowd out intrinsic motivation

185
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,120
okay so the the the two papers with Babu

186
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,000
are along those lines the first line is

187
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,320
basically that you know if I give you an

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,919
incentive I may reveal something about

189
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,920
you or the trust have in you or about

190
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,560
the task and that may actually

191
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,160
backfires because it conveys information

192
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,600
to you that discourages you um the

193
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,959
second one which is more familiar from

194
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,560
psychology is the idea of uh uh that you

195
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:04,320
know if I pay pay you to do something

196
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,760
like giving your blood uh then people

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
don't know whether you're giving your

198
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,560
blood because you are generous or

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,880
because you are greedy you want the

200
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,839
money so that kind of stuff so that

201
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,560
those the two papers uh I had with h

202
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,920
about that so but you know I could go on

203
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,600
and on so you know much of our work is

204
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,920
actually about cases in which markets

205
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,040
don't work in which incentives don't

206
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,880
work but nonetheless it is a case that

207
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,440
you know

208
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,560
we we are still more pro market and pro

209
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,560
incentive than the average person in the

210
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,200
population right and you know same thing

211
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,320
for the empirical work there is a lot of

212
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,079
empirical work showing that actually

213
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,680
incentives may be needed um and that's

214
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,200
something that is not very

215
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,839
well

216
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,519
received you can ask why why is that the

217
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,800
case I me part of the thing is that we

218
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,920
are the bearer of bad news okay because

219
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
when we say

220
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,079
we need

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,200
incentives we implicitly say people are

222
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,839
not as nice as we would like them to be

223
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,320
right that's exactly the point which is

224
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,519
we would like people to be nice but they

225
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,839
are not that nice they keep on polluting

226
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,399
etc

227
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,720
etc

228
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,760
um and you know that that triggers

229
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,640
reaction in France every time you talk

230
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,399
about a carbon price people say you know

231
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,040
the environment should not be per

232
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,360
protecting the environment should not be

233
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,240
punitive you know it's it's always the

234
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,079
same thing um you don't trust people I

235
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,600
mean sure I mean I don't I don't trust

236
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,360
people I mean over the last 30 years

237
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,680
nothing has happened in the fight

238
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
against climate change come on but you

239
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,279
know still people they still say oh no

240
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,920
no people will do what it takes and come

241
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,440
on I mean you know the answer is no it's

242
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,360
not going to happen we're the planet is

243
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,760
going to burn um so I don't know I mean

244
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,120
is like

245
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,600
U um but so still despite all the

246
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,959
caveats we've been working on for for

247
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,120
decades it's still the case that we are

248
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,920
pro market and pro incentive on on on

249
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:19,760
the all right compared to the population

250
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,240
okay um H you know and then the

251
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,760
psychologist I already talk about

252
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,600
the those ones but uh the legal scholar

253
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,680
actually have have another line of

254
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,760
attack which is which is interesting is

255
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,440
about the

256
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,399
expressive uh content of the law so

257
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,920
basically the idea is the law is not an

258
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,000
just an incentive scheme I mean we tend

259
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,560
to see the law as an incentive scheme

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,639
you know you have to pay a fine you go

261
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,760
to jail I mean that's that's going to

262
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,959
incentivize you to behave well um legal

263
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,680
Scholars they go beyond that they say oh

264
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,000
but no but the law also sends a signal

265
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,680
to society about the norm in society

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,279
about the views what is acceptable or

267
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,800
not so it it goes goes beyond that okay

268
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:09,760
and then philosophers I

269
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:13,560
mentioned so they they're unhappy with

270
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,360
markets okay now I'm not going to go

271
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,680
into that but um in economics common

272
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,040
good I spent a fair amount of time

273
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,360
trying to explain that a number of

274
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,720
repugnant

275
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,880
markets are

276
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,000
actually markets with externalities with

277
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,279
internalities with whatever asymmetric

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,160
information they can be explained in the

279
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,519
framework of Economics you know there is

280
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
no contradiction between economics and

281
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,920
the repugnant Market I me just take

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,120
babies for adoption I mean you know we

283
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
will not want to be we will not want the

284
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,320
babies for adoption to be sold to the I

285
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,320
beer okay well I mean there you might

286
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,880
say well after all if someone is willing

287
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,920
to pay a lot for the baby that maybe

288
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,760
that person is is going to benefit more

289
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,680
for the baby but you know there's a

290
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,000
third

291
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,320
party who is not part of the contract

292
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,399
that it's a baby right you know you have

293
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,079
a huge anxiety on the baby you have no

294
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,959
guarantee that actually the the I beer

295
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,360
is going to be the best father or mother

296
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,240
right um but you know it goes beyond

297
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,880
that also something which is interesting

298
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,240
which is image ex is so that I discussed

299
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,760
U sometimes you know you could have two

300
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,320
parties who are actually part of a

301
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,440
contract but their contract actually may

302
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,680
shed bad light on the rest of the

303
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,639
population and you image externalities

304
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,959
is thing then there are all kinds of

305
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,920
internalities but internalities

306
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,959
you know like like present bias for

307
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,519
example is just an exet on yourself on

308
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,839
your future self so it's the same thing

309
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,240
so we we don't we don't like um you know

310
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,160
people who sell

311
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,519
drugs or

312
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,279
opioids or things like that um and of

313
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,759
course we are against involuntary

314
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,199
slavery because of that's huge exality

315
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,480
but we are against even against

316
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,800
voluntary slavery and say we not

317
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,759
voluntary slavery if everybody agrees

318
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,600
why not to a contract but you know of

319
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,000
course there are there are present

320
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199
biases which uh which could play a big

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
role in those

322
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,920
markets asymmetric

323
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,279
information and sandal for example say w

324
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,079
those Economist will say okay just pay

325
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,079
to get friends I mean but if you pay to

326
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,560
get to get a friend and how do you know

327
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,680
this person is your friend you it's just

328
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,120
start symmetric information it makes no

329
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,000
sense right um so there is there's at at

330
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,639
least a number of those things that can

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,959
be it's just a consequence of standard

332
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:49,519
economics you know so so but the thing I

333
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,880
want to insist

334
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:56,199
on is more postures I don't like more

335
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,320
postures I mean that's my own bias um

336
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:02,519
which is they can be useful as a warning

337
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,519
signal so you know I see something I I

338
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,399
get some emotion and that might suggest

339
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,199
that something might be wrong okay so

340
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,160
it's a warning signal it's actually can

341
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:15,680
be useful but I don't like people who

342
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,040
who just stay with the emotion and say I

343
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,680
don't like

344
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,000
it and you know this is immoral without

345
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,360
explaining why and and that's something

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,120
because you know if you say you know in

347
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,040
the old time you know for example

348
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,600
life insurance was immoral everybody

349
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,399
thought life insurance was immoral now

350
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,360
why I mean so they would say oh yeah it

351
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,959
has to do with life sure I mean come on

352
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,480
uh you know same thing you know in many

353
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,120
countries today and most countries

354
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,839
yesterday you know having sex among

355
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,040
people of the same sex or different

356
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,600
races for example was sort of as immoral

357
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,720
by a majority of people and that was

358
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
just a way of actually infringing on the

359
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,240
freedom of people

360
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,959
so you know those moral postures are

361
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,839
more always very nervous and you know

362
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,959
when I hear philosophers telling me Oh

363
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:15,079
this is IM moral period I just I just

364
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,519
don't don't like it again the warning s

365
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:21,319
signal is is pretty fine I our emotions

366
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,319
actually can reveal real issues but you

367
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,120
know you have to go the next step and

368
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:28,240
say let's think a little bit more about

369
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,480
this is is there an exality is somebody

370
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,319
is someone and so on and so forth right

371
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,839
so that's just my own view on this okay

372
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:40,120
questions

373
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,600
yes how sort of could we differ or think

374
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,160
about the sort of difference from you

375
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,279
know someone sort of having a sort of

376
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,199
moral cost of you know taking some

377
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,199
action or consuming some thing um and

378
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,680
then someone having a sort of blockage

379
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,639
where there's a cut off after which they

380
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,920
they just stop um even considering that

381
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,519
you know

382
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,480
considerations that a possible thing

383
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:08,000
that we could do for instance so there's

384
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,000
this thing that the very very Act of

385
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
thinking about

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,319
something um actually Reveals All

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
stuff there is this movie I don't

388
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,559
remember the T I was not such a good

389
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,600
movie but there was this movie in which

390
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,640
a millionaire was offering there was a

391
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,919
young

392
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,600
couple very good uh uh United couple

393
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,400
and then the millionaire comes and but

394
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,000
they they are poor and the millionaire

395
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,160
comes in and say you know I pay 1

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,760
million to sleep with your wife and then

397
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,120
they start entertaining the S and I

398
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,720
actually don't remember what happens in

399
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,440
the end but you know they start

400
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,520
entertaining their s and that that

401
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,720
destroys their even entertaining their s

402
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,679
destroys their couple right uh not doing

403
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,360
it just just just thinking about it and

404
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,600
same thing you know if if if you tell a

405
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,919
Catholic you have to uh to think about

406
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,880
you know whether Mary could be a virgin

407
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:11,360
or whatever you just that that just

408
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,200
starting to question things may actually

409
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,840
already is a signal is that what you had

410
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,840
in mind or yeah

411
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,440
and and

412
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,640
sometimes we economists actually are

413
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,559
guilty of that in a sense so you know

414
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,600
you may

415
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:34,440
remember last summer talking

416
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,960
about taking uh you know polluting stuff

417
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,520
to less developed

418
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,039
countries because they they're willing

419
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,360
to get less money in order to to take

420
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,919
care of the stuff and that was that was

421
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,919
a big Scandal I don't remember if he was

422
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,960
recommending it which is a different

423
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,840
thing uh just thinking about it was just

424
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,799
already thought of as

425
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,880
being very

426
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:01,840
strange um and you know that's we often

427
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,400
actually when do we do research we often

428
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,799
think about various other things which

429
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,440
may be S as as not as not right and I

430
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,240
would say it's part of the freedom of

431
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,039
the researcher now when we go public

432
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:20,840
it's a different different ball game

433
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:23,400
right uh so I will try to distinguish my

434
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,760
between my life as a researcher where I

435
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,720
want to enjoy maximum freedom of thought

436
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,320
and then you maybe when I go public I

437
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,240
may offend some people and so on and

438
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,320
that's that's a different thing

439
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,880
um but of course there's always a same

440
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,960
line between the

441
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:46,520
two um now if you think about our

442
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,640
society's organizer and you know all of

443
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,360
that but I just want to to give you the

444
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,039
framework um you know I I will say it's

445
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,840
Adam Smith plus

446
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:05,120
pigu okay um it's Adam Smith Plus pigu

447
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:09,080
so the very bizarre thing uh is that by

448
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:13,520
and large we have for-profit

449
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:17,200
corporations so for-profit corporations

450
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,760
are entities in which uh the decision

451
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,280
making obeys the

452
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,000
shoulders the shoulders

453
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,679
decide um of course you know it's not

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,400
quite true you have agency issues with

455
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,840
with the managers and we have worked on

456
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,120
all those things but basically it's the

457
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,720
shoulders to decide now we know why it's

458
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,159
the case because that makes that where

459
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,840
the shoulders make sure they get their

460
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,799
money back otherwise they might not get

461
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,120
their money back or investors more

462
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,919
Journey but still raises the issue that

463
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,880
shareholders of course are interested in

464
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,200
the decision they want their money back

465
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,039
but what about workers and suppliers and

466
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,159
customers and so there are many

467
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:06,080
stakeholders ERS in were actually

468
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:09,000
left left aside in this decision Prime

469
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,080
right so we have this this situation

470
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,039
where one of the stakeholders takes a

471
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,919
decision those are the investors and the

472
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,240
others are basically

473
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:23,559
left uh their decision

474
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:26,320
experties so that that speaks to the co

475
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:31,360
corporate social responsibility

476
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,279
right um fredman at this uh famous

477
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,039
column in which he said the

478
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,640
responsibility of business is actually

479
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,440
to maximize profit not to take into

480
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,480
account the stakeholders

481
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,640
welfare and his colleague at Chicago

482
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,159
actually said well if you want to

483
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,840
protect shoulders this is Ronald

484
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,720
Co okay you the first one was Milton

485
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,720
Freeman so I realize your generation may

486
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,760
never have seen a picture of Milton fman

487
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,760
or Ronald Co but uh So Co basically said

488
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,120
well let's have contracts to protect

489
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,960
shoulders and to some extent that's

490
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,320
that's being done so the contracts with

491
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,000
which insulate the most the workers or

492
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,400
the debt holders and so on against the

493
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,559
decisions of

494
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,919
shoulders um are say for example the

495
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,600
worker is a fixed wage plus some sance

496
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,720
pay if they are lead

497
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,559
off um same thing if you look at uh Deb

498
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,799
holders they get often some fixed debt

499
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,240
repayment uh plus some collateral

500
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,240
pledging in case uh The Firm goes

501
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,480
bankrupt and you could also have exit

502
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,960
options and the like okay so basically

503
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,360
the idea okay shoulders this side that's

504
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,120
onal cause in a sense shoulders this

505
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,360
side but you protect the stakeholders

506
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,080
through

507
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,679
Contracting now the next step is oh yeah

508
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,559
where but what about the quality of

509
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:05,760
Contracting of course uh imperfect

510
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,520
contracts Collective action Prime and

511
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,919
the environment and competition policy

512
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,760
are good example you have millions of

513
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,919
people who are affected by the decision

514
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
of the firm and of course it's very hard

515
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
for them to contract with the firms and

516
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,520
so on um and there are many other issues

517
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,320
with

518
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,559
cause okay so in a sense what we have

519
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,679
converge to is some kind of mixture

520
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:33,360
of you know which one was with Miss and

521
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:37,159
we speak good right um the uh to to mix

522
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,960
um to to mix basically a market the

523
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:43,360
invisible end of the market together

524
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,520
with together with with

525
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,919
Recreation so in a

526
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,000
sense the other way you can protect

527
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,320
stakeholders is to have a

528
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,120
regulation you have an environmental

529
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,120
agency you have a competition policy you

530
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,159
have banking regulator you have someone

531
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,840
govern is going to protect the

532
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,840
stakeholders okay so that's the

533
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,120
thing now in this world where you have

534
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,440
the market which which is pretty

535
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,520
efficient but has lots of market

536
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
failures then the government corrects

537
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,760
the market failure it's simple

538
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:27,320
World okay we are Market fixers in a

539
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,840
sense um why should there be any

540
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,279
corporate social responsibility or a

541
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,559
social responsibility as an

542
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,480
investor um and the answer is there is

543
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,880
none if the government does the job you

544
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,720
don't have to do the

545
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,840
job the problem is that in practice

546
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,360
there is a twin failure

547
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,880
between so there is a market failure

548
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,200
plus a government failure and the carbon

549
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,039
Cas is is is a is a typical example the

550
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,559
market

551
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:02,720
failure the firms and the IND du can

552
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,679
emit carbon they have no incentive not

553
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,039
to and the government doesn't want to

554
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,720
have a carbon tax pay it so you have a

555
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,440
twin failure now we we can ask why is

556
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,679
that the government fails and there are

557
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,919
many reasons for that but you know so

558
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,840
then given that the market fails the

559
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,760
government fails what is left civil

560
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,600
society and that's where we have a

561
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,399
social responsibility

562
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,440
right I told you a little bit about the

563
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:32,640
repugnant Market which is only a subset

564
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,520
of markets which are attacked uh but

565
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,039
there is a broader condemnation of

566
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,760
markets in a sense all

567
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,559
markets um on the basis that the social

568
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,679
value of activities May differ from

569
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:50,640
Pride gain that's something that

570
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:54,559
economists worked on all the time um in

571
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,799
a sense we you know we know about eties

572
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,440
and the like and something I'm going to

573
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:03,600
to disc discuss in the I discuss in the

574
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,520
work with Matias the report is the IDE

575
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,000
which is more subtle that

576
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,640
market can actually frame ethical

577
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
choices so the idea is

578
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,440
that the

579
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,600
managers confronted with this twin

580
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Market plus government failure the mates

581
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,320
actually could substitute and say okay

582
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm going to behave

583
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,840
morly

584
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,200
okay um

585
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,520
no there's there's the issue about

586
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,480
whether they will be allowed by

587
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,440
shoulders to do that but same thing the

588
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,760
shoulders could behave morly right if

589
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,600
they are if they are socially

590
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,159
responsible they could behave

591
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,080
morly

592
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:52,960
um so but still the market might be

593
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,080
creating issues with be Mor Behavior

594
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,520
especially if you're are a

595
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,840
consequentialist which I hope you

596
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,440
are uh

597
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,880
I don't know I'm not going to impose

598
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,279
values on you that doesn't make sense

599
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:12,320
but consequentialist means you know you

600
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:15,720
care about consequences of of things um

601
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,840
so and actually this is I think the most

602
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:23,799
poent uh criticism of of

603
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:27,440
consequentialism but um so the issue

604
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,320
about the replacement logic is basically

605
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,360
okay I don't like to pollute but if I

606
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,880
don't pollute somebody else

607
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,679
will I don't like to sell weapons to a

608
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,279
dictator that's not

609
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:44,279
nice but what the hell if I if I if I

610
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,679
don't do it somebody will sell weapons

611
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:50,399
to that dictator which is correct right

612
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,799
um okay I don't like to bribe official

613
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,600
it's not very

614
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:56,360
Mor but you know if I don't bribe I

615
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,240
don't get the contract and someone who

616
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,640
bribes is going to get it so in the end

617
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
and the outcome is the same so I might

618
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,600
as well do it myself because I make

619
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,399
money out of it um the doctors who over

620
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,360
prescribe Ops were saying that saying I

621
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:18,559
don't like to over prescribe Ops but you

622
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:22,000
know if I if I don't if I don't do it

623
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,679
um some other doctor will prescribe

624
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,840
op the same thing happens with sick

625
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:30,159
leave so in France you go to any doctor

626
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,039
you want to

627
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,559
be you you want to seek leave for for

628
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,039
for two weeks doctor SS uh even so

629
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,000
you're in perfect health but you know

630
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,000
the story is that the the of course if

631
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,279
if the doctor doesn't do that another do

632
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,200
next Doctor will do it anyway um the and

633
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,360
there are many other examples I mean

634
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,080
athletes for example you know you know

635
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,240
many cyclists don't like to take those

636
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,919
drugs or many food ball player and so on

637
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,320
they don't like to take those tracks but

638
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,679
you know they say you know it's the only

639
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,840
way I can I can actually

640
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:13,399
compete uh and so

641
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,000
on so you see the the idea in all those

642
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,279
example there's a common idea is that

643
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,039
competitive pressure is going to make it

644
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:26,519
hard to actually

645
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:28,559
um uh to actually compete so the

646
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,559
conclusion in quotes is that you should

647
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,480
relax competition and therefore that has

648
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:38,159
deep implication for

649
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,440
271 okay um so that's something we are

650
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,679
going to

651
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,960
discuss now I already mentioned that um

652
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,519
that might have implication for

653
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,320
competition policy which are being

654
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,080
discussed right now the promotion of

655
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,880
open platform ecosystem for competitive

656
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,120
procurement uh for trade and so on uh

657
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,799
and and that might also have there also

658
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,039
discussion about where whether you

659
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:07,039
should

660
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:10,640
actually um either favor or just

661
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,240
completely allocate a market

662
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:18,200
to know firms which are not for

663
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,480
profit um so that that the kind of thing

664
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,760
so uh should we for example

665
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,159
make there was in France there was a

666
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,919
scandal this year ago but retirement B

667
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,039
you know they they they charge a lot of

668
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,720
money and and provided a very low

669
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,640
quality at least some of them um same

670
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,720
thing has happened with hospital and so

671
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,159
on I mean should they all be not for

672
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,279
profit should universities be be not for

673
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,799
profit actually most of them

674
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:51,799
are

675
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:56,039
uh well me they're not not for not for

676
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:59,679
profit for everyone but but you know the

677
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:03,200
um should they they be subsidized and so

678
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:07,480
on so um those are important issues

679
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,120
right and I mean in the last decades

680
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,639
nobody was talking about that that much

681
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,919
but now it's

682
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:19,120
resurfacing okay

683
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:21,360
just last caveat before I I go into more

684
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,440
technical

685
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,120
stuff

686
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,600
um I'm not going to invent anything on

687
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,600
morality I mean people have been

688
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,559
discussing this for Millennia so I'm not

689
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,240
going to say any any anything

690
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,799
interesting on morality but I just want

691
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,760
to to say you know we economists have a

692
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,880
view of

693
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:48,399
morality which tend to be in a sense no

694
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:51,279
externality or kind of you know some uh

695
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,760
basically you know if I stab you then

696
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,880
you you'll find it's not very nice it's

697
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,760
not quite

698
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:03,720
Mor um the avoidance of of harm okay um

699
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,799
and I would say this kind of conception

700
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:12,200
of M is the more stable across culture

701
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:14,799
and across time um but it's

702
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,840
restrictive PE many people have a much

703
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,679
broader view of morality so if you look

704
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:26,159
at Jonathan Height's books for example

705
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,960
you get lots of examples of immoral

706
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,880
Behavior

707
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,919
without victims in a sense okay so one

708
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,080
of his you know anything that violates a

709
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,399
convention or taboo or general disgust

710
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,279
or something you know his f one of his

711
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,919
favorite example if you haven't read the

712
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:50,720
book is about you know your favorite

713
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:54,760
dog uh runs out of the house and is run

714
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,200
over by a car the dog the dog is dead

715
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,159
it's your favorite dog so you are very

716
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,799
sad you take the dog you cook the dog

717
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,960
and you eat the dog

718
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,720
okay

719
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,960
now you might say there's no harm the

720
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,799
dog is dead right why don't you eat

721
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,480
it now many people view will view that

722
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:21,279
as being totally

723
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,159
disgusting okay and that that the kind

724
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,360
of thing and and many many things about

725
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,519
you know the more serious example are

726
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,120
things like U

727
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:34,399
Duty Authority loyalty to the in group

728
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,880
and so on which are deep value for many

729
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,159
people now an economists will not think

730
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,919
of those as being de values they might

731
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,399
might think of that as being an

732
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,080
instrument so sure loyalty may be

733
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,639
important but that's an instrument to

734
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,480
sustain cooporation for example or same

735
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:53,080
thing Authority might be an efficiency

736
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,880
enhancing stuff but we would not value

737
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,039
Authority per se right as an economist

738
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,519
but many people do you know and that the

739
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,720
kind of thing that U you know and that

740
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,359
raises the more the more J issue about

741
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,440
what what do we mean by

742
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:13,119
harm so you know and that's something

743
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,520
which is very important now in

744
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,000
universities you know if I tell you

745
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,079
something you don't like am I is that an

746
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,079
AG is that

747
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,079
aggressive

748
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,800
right so of course if it's an insult

749
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,800
something racist or something like of

750
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,480
course it is but if it's an opinion

751
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,960
which is not your

752
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,560
opinion okay is that is that aggressive

753
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,720
so that that's really that's really

754
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,480
that's really big thing and you know and

755
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,079
you know huge debate now on on exactly

756
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,200
those those those

757
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:58,599
things um so let me I mean we could talk

758
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,480
for hours about that but uh uh

759
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,610
do you have do you have

760
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,659
any any views on that or any

761
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,659
[Music]

762
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,160
questional how much is I'm sorry how

763
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,839
much how much is by Society how much is

764
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,440
by some inate

765
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:28,000
nature I guess it's pretty unknown I

766
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,560
mean

767
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,480
um I mean Society plays a big role of

768
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,839
course because of social norms and as as

769
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,280
we see from some of these example they

770
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,480
flu toate a lot across time for example

771
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,040
or across

772
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,760
culture so the social Norm are very

773
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,760
important

774
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,760
um

775
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,720
now it's it's hard to say of course we

776
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,119
learn that actually punching the other

777
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,960
child is not a nice thing to do

778
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:03,040
right um

779
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,680
now is is that innate or is that Society

780
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,800
right um we would probably would have

781
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,760
learned it by yourself anyway but you

782
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,760
know just but I I don't

783
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,760
know

784
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,160
I we we still are a social species and a

785
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,000
Cooperative species right by and

786
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,640
large uh

787
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,680
so how much do we learn through a

788
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,040
genetics I I don't know I mean anyone

789
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,040
knows

790
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:42,119
here I guess that kind of CH is how you

791
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,920
think of the um

792
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:48,400
intervention it is

793
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,160
in yeah it becomes more more

794
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,920
difficult but I I would guess much of it

795
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,200
is not in it because you see the

796
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,280
difference across culture and across

797
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,119
time that actually the

798
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,800
what is being considered more in one

799
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,480
Society may not be in another

800
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,359
society and you know that's why I was

801
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,160
saying Do no harm are more kind of

802
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:17,319
universal you know everybody think that

803
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,599
um that committing a crime for example

804
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:22,680
is not M right

805
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,640
um I mean even

806
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,800
pollution you know some nobody will say

807
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,800
it's great to pollute

808
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,079
even those who don't care you know they

809
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,839
will not claim the immoral High ground

810
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,800
and say it's wonderful to pollute no no

811
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,440
this is you

812
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,000
know those are relatively consensual

813
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,839
issues in a sense we we may disagree

814
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,839
about the importance but the sign is is

815
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,839
clear

816
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:56,040
okay yes yeah so going back to the point

817
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,160
on competition so is there a sense in

818
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,560
which having more compe can actually be

819
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,560
a bad thing the result is that's what we

820
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,760
that's what we're going to study now uh

821
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,280
because that's a claim is that

822
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,240
competition basically take the morality

823
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,000
out out of people right so the managers

824
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,520
or the shoulders they will behave better

825
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,720
if they were in a non-compete world but

826
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,640
that doesn't exclude the possibility

827
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,400
that if there was no competition that

828
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,400
you know firms would still do imortal

829
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,599
things just to purely seek profit that's

830
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,480
that that would be a possibility so we

831
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,200
are going to look at an environment

832
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,960
where people have moral preferences so

833
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,640
they care about their money but they

834
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,040
also care about other things which I

835
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,240
think we all are like that to some

836
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,880
extent we you know we to different

837
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,520
extents of course but you know we care

838
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,920
about the money but we also care about

839
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:54,520
doing the right thing with different

840
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,800
intensities of course

841
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:01,440
right um so what we're going to see is

842
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,440
that um the nature of competition

843
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,240
affects Market maret in many ways so

844
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,319
it's going to depend on the intensity of

845
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,040
competition so Market structure the

846
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:14,920
number of firms their sub ability which

847
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,319
are standard IO thing but uh it's going

848
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,680
to depend also whether on whether prices

849
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:24,079
are are flexible or fixed you're going

850
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,560
to tell me price is always flexible well

851
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,200
not quite because sometimes your price

852
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,599
is fixed so if you are a doctor in many

853
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,520
countries or or notary or whatever you

854
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,920
get some fixed amount of money right or

855
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,920
taxi

856
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,960
or you you don't have a you don't have

857
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,560
price

858
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,880
flexibility um in franchising

859
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,680
environment you know the your price may

860
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,440
be determined by the franchiser anyway

861
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,680
so they sometimes the prices are are

862
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,200
fixed but the normal thing is flexible

863
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,599
prices then we'll see it's important to

864
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,640
know whether cutting a SLE Corner lowest

865
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,319
cost or boost demand we are going to by

866
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,359
the way we are going to look at at a

867
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,000
situation where all stakeholders can

868
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:13,640
have more preferences they can be zero

869
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,599
but they can be also positive so the

870
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,160
stakeholders are of course you have the

871
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,960
managers but you also have the consumer

872
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,119
the investors the

873
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:29,119
workers okay so here is a picture you

874
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:32,599
will have an oligopoly with end firms

875
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,800
uh those firms will set a price so you

876
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,079
know except if the prices are

877
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,240
regulated and they will choose a

878
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:43,880
morality of their morality technology if

879
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,160
you want so they can choose something

880
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:50,160
that pollutes a lot or pollutes little

881
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:53,359
they may be nice with their workers they

882
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,839
may uh misrepresent their product they

883
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,839
may you know all kinds of issues which

884
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:02,319
create externality on people and raises

885
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,640
a moral issue

886
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:09,520
okay um they will sell to the

887
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,079
consumers and they they are input

888
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:17,960
suppliers like workers and investors

889
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,960
they bring labor and capital to the firm

890
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,640
okay now those are

891
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:26,920
stakeholders so they may care actually

892
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,800
about the more more action of the AAL

893
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,800
action which are chosen by the firms so

894
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,040
the consumer for example might want to

895
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:39,079
buy Fair Trade coffee or whatever might

896
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,160
actually want to have more production

897
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,560
for their

898
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,240
consumptions same thing the workers make

899
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,160
care they may want to work for I firm

900
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,200
they are you know by the way you know if

901
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,400
you look at um there's a premium

902
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,599
actually which is paid to workers

903
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,200
working say in the tobacco

904
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,079
industry so you know if if you work in

905
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,960
an industry which is considered as a

906
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:07,119
mall you have a higher wage or Casino or

907
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,880
whatever um same thing for investors

908
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,800
investors might want to engage in

909
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,040
socially responsible

910
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,040
investment okay

911
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,000
now the key question as we're going to

912
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,440
see is whether unethical Behavior raises

913
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,839
or lowers

914
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,400
demand because if social responsibility

915
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,720
as we're going to see go through the

916
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,720
cost

917
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,559
structure um then it's not going to have

918
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,880
any competition is not going to have

919
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,280
impact because competition is going to

920
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,559
operate through the demand curve not on

921
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,079
the cost

922
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,599
side

923
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,599
uh okay so we are going to see that's

924
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,920
going to be this pretty unclear at this

925
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:59,079
stage so the model is is the following

926
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:02,400
um IOP end firms so unit demand consumer

927
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,720
say um The Firm chooses a price firm I

928
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,079
choose a price

929
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:10,240
pi and and a s action

930
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:14,440
AI um so think of AI equal zero as the

931
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,800
most immoral action so you pollute

932
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,480
maximally um for

933
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,880
example and that

934
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,280
um you you sell to any

935
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,359
dictator uh you sell weapons to any

936
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,920
dictator and that creates some that has

937
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,760
a welfare impact think of that as been

938
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,040
an

939
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:41,160
externality um welfare impact W of AI

940
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,079
per unit of so you might think for

941
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,599
example that might be the pollution

942
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:49,400
damage from emitting

943
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,880
carbon okay it might be the the Damage

944
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,520
Done by the dictator with the weapons or

945
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,880
that kind of thing and it's increasing

946
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,520
AI so I will be a more more

947
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,480
action um and just by it's just a

948
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:09,000
normalization AI will belong to some

949
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,280
interval okay uh with zero being the

950
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,960
lower

951
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,720
bound and the welfare impact will be so

952
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,480
it will be increasing and it will be

953
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,079
concave

954
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,359
okay

955
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,960
um the more action may actually also

956
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,559
affect the unit cost so the unit cost of

957
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,480
production which will be

958
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,079
constant will be CI of

959
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,400
AI

960
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,760
now you can consider two cases one in

961
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,440
which this unit cost is increasing or

962
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,680
decreasing with a more action

963
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,400
so if you think about the mor action is

964
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,240
not using child

965
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,040
labor not using fossile

966
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:55,359
fuel then it's

967
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:58,680
expensive I mean people use children

968
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:01,040
they use carbon they they use call

969
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,440
because it's cheap otherwise they would

970
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,800
not be doing it right they use it

971
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,160
because it's cheap so in that case if

972
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,160
you behave more Morely your unit cost

973
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,119
goes up but there are also cases in

974
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,720
which when you behave Morely your unit

975
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,839
cost goes

976
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:22,440
down uh so that the case coming back to

977
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:25,800
the previous slide if you have

978
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,559
responsible input supplier so basically

979
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:31,319
workers or investor with social

980
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,880
preferences then they're willing to

981
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:37,040
actually have a lower weight or low

982
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:40,559
lower return on their capital in order

983
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,280
to be associated with a firm which be

984
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:46,079
small okay

985
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,240
so in that case if you behave more

986
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,599
morally your input supplier actually

987
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,800
offer you

988
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,640
discount okay because have social

989
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,319
preferences so in practice you you

990
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,040
really have both so we are going to be

991
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,119
agnostic at this stage about whether the

992
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,599
M action actually increases or decrease

993
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,680
the cost that depends on the

994
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,680
situation is that is that

995
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,640
clear now a key concept for what's going

996
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,680
to follow is the net price consumer care

997
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,000
about the price and they consider about

998
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,079
the call uh Behavior so they they also

999
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,520
would

1000
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,960
have social preferences I'm going to

1001
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,200
come to that that in a minute so

1002
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:37,880
everything for them will be as

1003
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:41,200
if um they care about the real price Pi

1004
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,119
the nominal price and then they will

1005
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,800
have some preferences over over the

1006
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,160
action the morality of the action now

1007
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,559
this F can be also increasing or

1008
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,880
decreasing with the morality of the

1009
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,880
action

1010
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,040
so usually consumers that prefer more

1011
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,160
more

1012
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,520
you they are socially responsible

1013
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,079
consumers they want Fair Trade coffee

1014
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:09,640
and they want workers right to

1015
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:12,599
be to be respected and so on um but

1016
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,520
there also Cas so in that case f is

1017
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,640
decreasing in

1018
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:21,000
AI okay because that's as if the price

1019
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:24,920
were going down but in the other example

1020
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,680
I gave you of bribing a foreign official

1021
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:33,200
selling weapons to a dictator

1022
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:37,040
giving more opioids and so on um there

1023
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,960
basically more fi is increasing in AI

1024
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,160
because if you choose a more more

1025
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,520
actions that means you are reluctant to

1026
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:48,280
sell uh weapons to the dictator you are

1027
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,800
more reant to to give opioids and that's

1028
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,880
going to reduce

1029
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:56,599
demand okay so same thing the more

1030
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,280
action can actually increase the amount

1031
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:02,240
of reduce demand but not in the same

1032
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,520
circumstances so for Fair Trade coffee

1033
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:10,880
more action is going to increase demand

1034
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:14,000
for um for the example I gave you with a

1035
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,119
replacement logic actually a moral

1036
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,240
action is going to reduce

1037
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:21,680
demand okay and that's going to be

1038
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,160
completely crucial for what's going to

1039
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,280
happen there will be an outside option

1040
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,119
so the consumer choose between one of

1041
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,079
the the firms and the outside option the

1042
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,599
outside option will

1043
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:37,760
have um an a z and a p 0 and P0 is often

1044
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:42,240
zero so if you don't consume it it might

1045
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:44,720
be zero but but still if your option is

1046
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,400
actually to reopen a call

1047
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:51,280
mins then P0 is small but a z is also

1048
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,960
very small

1049
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,160
okay

1050
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,799
um you have Vector of uh

1051
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:02,760
of net prices and those net prices are

1052
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:05,280
going to determine the demand so the

1053
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:09,040
demand for fari will depend the net

1054
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,319
price of firi and the net prices of of

1055
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,160
of the rivals there are substitute

1056
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:18,920
Goods

1057
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:22,680
okay so basically my

1058
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,680
demand uh increasing with your price and

1059
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,280
decreases with my price the standard

1060
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,960
assumption

1061
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:35,680
so you can you can think about a discret

1062
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:38,160
model in which uh basically there are

1063
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,400
there are valuations which are drawn

1064
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,280
including for the outside option by the

1065
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,680
way um and you choose which option you

1066
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,480
prefer and that's one way of of

1067
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,280
generating such a

1068
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:55,599
demand

1069
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,319
okay so we are going to call E the

1070
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:02,160
elasticity of demand

1071
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,920
for firi so it's DDI over DPI or DPI add

1072
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,240
the

1073
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:11,559
same um because P at is equal to Pi + 5

1074
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:15,040
I so that's a standard of demand we make

1075
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,720
the standard assumption that when price

1076
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,880
prices go

1077
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,440
up the elive demand

1078
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:27,359
decreases okay it's almost the same

1079
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:30,280
assumption uh as saying

1080
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,440
the goods are strategic strategic

1081
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,920
complement okay so it's strategic

1082
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,760
complimentarity assumption

1083
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,760
basically so you assume that for higher

1084
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,359
prices the elasticity are lower which is

1085
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,599
stand standard but it's also standard

1086
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:51,119
just to assume that basically the goods

1087
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:51,119
are strategic complements

1088
00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:00,920
okay so I make the Assumption I make a

1089
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:06,000
so what's going to play a big role is

1090
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:09,000
this uh I'm going to say that demand

1091
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,559
demand when demand increases with with

1092
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,240
the morality of the action that means

1093
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:18,839
the consumer are socially

1094
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:21,079
responsible when demand decreases with

1095
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:23,760
the moral

1096
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,079
action then consumer are socially

1097
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,799
irresponsible so all the example I gave

1098
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,440
you on the first slide were examples

1099
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:34,319
with socially responsible consumer the

1100
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,359
dictator the consumer of the

1101
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:40,599
opioids yeah the the official who gets

1102
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:45,119
bribed the athletes who actually wants a

1103
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:48,280
drug and performance ening rug and so on

1104
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:51,839
so basically so socially irr responsible

1105
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:54,799
consumer F Prime is negative so

1106
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,119
responsible consumer means that firei

1107
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:59,359
Prime is positive so for example one of

1108
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,480
the things that might happen is that you

1109
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,559
internalize and this this going to be a

1110
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:08,680
first example of social preferences you

1111
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:11,319
internalize um the welfare impact of

1112
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,400
Your Action so think about that as being

1113
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:16,559
the cost of pollution for

1114
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,839
example then you you put a weight Alpha

1115
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,079
C on the cost of your

1116
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:22,640
pollution which in all will be less than

1117
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:25,880
one because you don't never fully

1118
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,400
internalize the impact on others but uh

1119
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,920
okay

1120
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,599
now you have this strange case in which

1121
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,680
I mean they look like homoeconomicus of

1122
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:39,000
course in which consumers don't care

1123
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,799
about the moral action or I should say

1124
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,559
rather they may not observe the moral

1125
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:46,040
action because also cases in which you

1126
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,599
don't observe the moral action of the of

1127
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,400
the firm in in that case their demand

1128
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:52,680
doesn't react to a moral action because

1129
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,440
they don't observe it and they are kind

1130
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,440
of socially

1131
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,880
neutral do you

1132
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,880
have do you have

1133
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:08,640
questions about the framework yes sure

1134
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:11,200
um how restrictive at all is it to have

1135
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:15,240
um the morality term entering through

1136
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:18,880
the price like that yeah so the the the

1137
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:20,520
additivity property yeah yeah so so the

1138
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,240
idea is that in a sense there is no

1139
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,920
income effect so you pay a price and

1140
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:29,799
then you get some benefit or some cost

1141
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,200
of uh

1142
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:40,400
um uh of of the moral

1143
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:43,040
action okay so if it's true if if this

1144
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,599
this particular purchase were re big

1145
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,480
compared to the income of the person

1146
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,440
that might not all for

1147
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,760
example um so think about a bribe for

1148
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,400
example for an

1149
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,799
official so if the official gets lots of

1150
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,520
small bribes that's that's not an issue

1151
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:04,040
uh

1152
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,839
but if that was a huge rbe which then

1153
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,680
that might there might be some income

1154
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,559
effect

1155
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,040
which you know because then you know

1156
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,200
that means the marginal utility of

1157
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,200
income and therefore the price in a

1158
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,200
sense the impact of the price will not

1159
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,559
be the

1160
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:24,319
same um but it's pretty reasonable I

1161
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:28,319
would say in

1162
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:28,319
general um

1163
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,559
that's a good

1164
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,920
question okay the cost side impact of

1165
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,720
ethical

1166
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,599
behavior um

1167
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,720
so we're we're going to assume it's more

1168
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,240
General than that actually but we're

1169
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,520
just going to assume that people have

1170
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:52,319
social preferences so they

1171
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:57,240
internalize then internaly wi to some

1172
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:59,319
extent so uh imagine just to normalize

1173
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,319
imagine that an in you need one unit of

1174
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:02,799
capital and one unit of Labor to produce

1175
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:06,480
one unit of

1176
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:11,720
good um and in Imagine That investor are

1177
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:16,799
willing to forgo Alpha I for investor wi

1178
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:19,400
AI in their return if okay and same

1179
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,559
thing for the workers with a different

1180
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:26,039
weight so they're willing to work for

1181
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:27,319
lower weight which if you are more M

1182
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:30,839
okay

1183
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:33,319
um then basically your modin

1184
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:36,359
cost you know the the way it changes

1185
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:39,640
with the action depends

1186
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:41,599
on the cost of doing business so here

1187
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,359
you might have the impact of child labor

1188
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:47,799
or pollutions if you use a polluting a

1189
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:50,559
cheap but polluting uh input but then on

1190
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:53,880
the other side you might also have the

1191
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:57,520
fact that workers and and investors are

1192
00:55:53,880 --> 00:56:00,720
willing to actually

1193
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:04,280
um get a lower weight lower return on

1194
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,280
their capital

1195
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:12,880
okay so I already said that in a sense

1196
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,839
uh demand impact of supply and M choice

1197
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,880
you have irresponsible consumers now in

1198
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:20,799
the paper in the appendic we have some

1199
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,400
foundation for the immen side benefit of

1200
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:26,720
cutting AAL color could

1201
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:29,280
be an anxiety that's the case of those

1202
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,799
example it could be an internet like an

1203
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,160
opioid it could also be all kinds of

1204
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:39,160
shrouded attributes also that could also

1205
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:42,680
be the case um and then responsible cons

1206
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,640
consumers right um I'm coming to the

1207
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:48,839
firm subjective function because that's

1208
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,200
so they two have social preferences so

1209
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:56,680
they care about the profit the profit is

1210
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:59,000
price minus unit cost times demand

1211
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,119
that's nothing new here but the

1212
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,200
difference with a standard firm is that

1213
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,839
they would have social preferences so

1214
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:10,039
they care about the

1215
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:14,359
welfare now we can discuss that what is

1216
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:18,280
welfare now in the paper we have a

1217
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:20,839
general we have General consequentialist

1218
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,640
preferences and I'm just going to give

1219
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:26,400
you one example of

1220
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,960
that okay which can be criticized but

1221
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,720
it's much broader than that okay so I'm

1222
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,839
going

1223
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:38,400
to assume for for the sake of of the

1224
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:40,640
argument that you internalize basically

1225
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,640
the

1226
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,240
industry pollution or the industry

1227
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:52,119
amount of opioids or something like that

1228
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:54,839
so you take into account the sum so

1229
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:58,119
basically firm J will get demand DJ a

1230
00:57:54,839 --> 00:58:03,280
fraction of consum DJ will go to firm

1231
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:07,520
J the welfare consequence of a firm J is

1232
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,680
WJ of AJ and you sum of our old firms

1233
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,599
and also the outside option

1234
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,880
possibly of those welfare consequences

1235
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:17,599
so you care say about the total

1236
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,280
pollution in the industry or the total

1237
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,039
amount of the opes that are sold in

1238
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,720
Industry

1239
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:28,880
okay there are the class of

1240
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,319
consequential preferences is much

1241
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,119
broader so you might internalize for

1242
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:38,280
example just your own

1243
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:42,280
wi di so your own pollution in

1244
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:44,920
sense which is harder to defend right

1245
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:48,079
Morely because you have to take into

1246
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,880
account also that if you sell one more

1247
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,720
if you get one more consumer that's

1248
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:55,640
consumer would have purchased elsewhere

1249
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,400
so Morely you will say no no just

1250
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:00,839
looking at that your own pollution makes

1251
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:05,079
no sense morally but that's okay for the

1252
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:07,599
theory you can allow it um and there are

1253
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:10,160
other other social consequences that you

1254
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,359
want you might want to to consider the

1255
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,960
important thing is that they are

1256
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:16,160
proportional to

1257
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,640
quantity and that's that's something

1258
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,160
which also can be debated so if you are

1259
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:25,480
consequentialist you say if I kill one

1260
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:28,039
bird is if I kill 1,000 bird it's 1,000

1261
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:31,319
times the cost of killing one bird for

1262
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:35,240
example right if it's not an adventerous

1263
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:40,440
species right if you might say if I kill

1264
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:44,760
1,000 Birds the damage is 1,000 times

1265
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:47,079
killing one Bird Okay uh some people

1266
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:50,240
don't think in those ways actually you

1267
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:53,640
know people would try to measure say the

1268
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,839
damage uh incurred when there's an oil

1269
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,200
spill for

1270
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:59,480
example you you see that people are

1271
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,079
willing to sometimes people are willing

1272
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:06,079
to pay almost as much for one to save

1273
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:10,640
one bird and to save 20 birds or 50

1274
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:14,520
Birds which morly makes no sense but is

1275
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:16,640
a reality right I mean we could discuss

1276
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,920
why it's the case actually why do people

1277
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,640
react in those ways so you can criticize

1278
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,000
but I'm I'm just going to assume that

1279
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,119
people are

1280
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,200
consequentialist okay

1281
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:30,599
so this is an important slide you do you

1282
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,599
have any

1283
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:40,640
question okay so social preferences so

1284
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,119
the key assumption you know and we might

1285
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,720
add your your comment on separability

1286
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,200
but the key assumption is

1287
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,720
consequentialism so all players the

1288
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,920
suppliers the consumer the workers

1289
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,720
investors perception of social impact of

1290
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,520
their trade is proportional to the side

1291
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,280
of

1292
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,760
trade so if you pull it twice as much

1293
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,160
it's twice as

1294
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:07,520
bad okay

1295
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:11,799
um the second assumption which is going

1296
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:15,359
to be crucial and read that carefully

1297
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:18,400
what is a flexible price so I will say

1298
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:20,319
the prices are locally flexible at eum

1299
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:25,960
configuration

1300
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:28,640
Pat um by saying that if I change my eal

1301
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,400
Behavior Delta AI a little

1302
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,039
bit then I can compensate through a

1303
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,240
price change whatever sign it has I can

1304
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:39,359
compensate through a price change Delta

1305
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,920
Pi which has to be of course minus 5

1306
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,920
Prime of a d so I has to keep the net

1307
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,760
price

1308
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:51,200
constant so if I change the mity of of

1309
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,920
my action I can have an upsetting effect

1310
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:57,119
in the price so that overall I don't

1311
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:00,720
change the attractiveness of my

1312
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,520
offering um and therefore demand remains

1313
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:06,440
constant in that

1314
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:08,319
case okay and there will be two

1315
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,160
important counter examples the first is

1316
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:13,680
a case where Pi is regulated of course

1317
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,480
because then you cannot do that the

1318
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,559
second which is more interesting in a

1319
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:21,319
sense is the case

1320
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:26,079
where the more you have limited

1321
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:28,720
liability so you see if if you have this

1322
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:32,680
train which is burning so if your price

1323
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:34,760
is equal to your marginal cost then you

1324
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:38,880
you in the limited liability

1325
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:40,680
region and if you say for example you

1326
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,160
increase your the morality of Your

1327
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:47,760
Action that cost you more money for

1328
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:51,359
example um then you have to

1329
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,359
you you have to raise your price

1330
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:57,880
accordingly

1331
01:02:53,359 --> 01:03:00,400
um right and that may not actually be

1332
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:03,160
neutral with respect to demand care so

1333
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,680
there's a link here that intr a direct

1334
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,240
link between the price and the mor

1335
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:10,319
action and same thing if you are not for

1336
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:14,160
profit basically you have to obey pi

1337
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:15,480
equal CI of AI and again you don't have

1338
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:20,640
flexible

1339
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:23,200
prices okay otherwise you do okay and

1340
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,359
finally we are going to assume constant

1341
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:27,880
returns a scale of a certain kind so I'm

1342
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:30,400
going to assume that the cost function I

1343
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:33,119
already did that is basically I mean you

1344
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,079
could have decreasing or increasing

1345
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,920
return to scale but at least with

1346
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:41,119
respect to the m action that has to be

1347
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,760
basically have constant return to

1348
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:45,359
scale

1349
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,400
okay um actually there are a bunch of

1350
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:49,200
cases where you can generalize so it's

1351
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,079
this assumption is not as strong as it

1352
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,079
looks but

1353
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:59,400
uh okay those are the assumptions

1354
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:02,359
um the first thing is

1355
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,480
that if you fix prices which will be the

1356
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:09,160
case when prices are regulated if you

1357
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:11,000
fix prices then the ethical choices are

1358
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:14,359
strategic

1359
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:18,160
complements under weak conditions so

1360
01:04:14,359 --> 01:04:20,640
that's going to be true if consumers are

1361
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,359
socially

1362
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:27,039
irresponsible that mean their demand

1363
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,760
decreases with a marity of the action

1364
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,680
that's always going to be true if the

1365
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:33,400
econom is symmetrical so if you're a

1366
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:35,440
symmetric economy and

1367
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:41,400
you

1368
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:43,200
or if the social preferences are not too

1369
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,839
not too

1370
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:49,000
strong um I mean you you have a first

1371
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:51,160
factor for strategic complementarity in

1372
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,039
strategic which is that we we have

1373
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,599
assume strategic complementarity in the

1374
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:59,839
first place on prices but since prices

1375
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:04,480
are like ethical choices you see that

1376
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:07,599
translate into into um strategic

1377
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,279
complimentarity for so that that that

1378
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,000
tells you

1379
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:14,640
that you

1380
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,559
know you may easily have multiple a or

1381
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:23,640
multiple social norms inal Behavior if

1382
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:25,839
prices are fixed exogenously if they are

1383
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,359
regulated which is not that's going to

1384
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,279
make things interesting which is not

1385
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:31,960
going to be the case at all if prices

1386
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:33,319
are flexible actually we are going to

1387
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,599
see that they're always uniquely

1388
01:05:33,319 --> 01:05:38,680
determin if prices are

1389
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,880
flexible so if prices are fixed you can

1390
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:44,039
have multiple social norms about Mo

1391
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:47,640
Behavior but when they are flexible

1392
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:47,640
we'll see there is only one possible

1393
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:57,319
n okay now here is the first condition

1394
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,319
with respect to AI

1395
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,279
actually I don't know if you have seen

1396
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,079
that you may not remember but you you

1397
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:10,039
have seen that many

1398
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:10,039
times if you have you know standard

1399
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:18,079
oligopolist with Alpha equals zero so

1400
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,240
there is no more preferences which is

1401
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:24,240
what you study in 271

1402
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:27,400
usually then you have learner index

1403
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:31,160
equals to one over L of Demand right

1404
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,400
where the learner index is Pius C pi the

1405
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,960
price cost

1406
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,160
margin that's true for monopolies but

1407
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,160
that's true also for anopolis of course

1408
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:43,359
the LC is not the same L of demand is

1409
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,839
not the same for for neopies and for the

1410
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:48,359
monopolies but this formula is always

1411
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:49,680
true that's just the first all condition

1412
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:53,359
with respect to

1413
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:55,960
price now I for the moment I'm not

1414
01:06:53,359 --> 01:07:00,599
maximizing this with respect to price

1415
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:04,400
and maximizing respect to uh the the

1416
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:06,079
action um just do the computation you

1417
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,160
know from the objective

1418
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:11,079
function and what is that so the left

1419
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,400
hand side so the the right hand side is

1420
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:17,440
something which is pretty well known

1421
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:18,920
product of the larner index times um it

1422
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,480
except we are going to see the larner

1423
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:23,000
index is a bit

1424
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:25,920
different and this is basically when you

1425
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,160
change AI

1426
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,119
you have this

1427
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:35,319
internalization of your own actions

1428
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:37,160
impact w i of a prime minus your

1429
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:41,279
marginal

1430
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:44,440
cost um and this fi Prime is just a

1431
01:07:41,279 --> 01:07:45,760
normalization is that that transform Mo

1432
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,039
action into

1433
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,880
money okay that's the marginal rate of

1434
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:52,520
substitution between the mo action and

1435
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:57,039
money for the

1436
01:07:52,520 --> 01:08:01,319
consumer okay so that's the that's the

1437
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:05,000
equation but an interesting thing is the

1438
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:07,119
expression of of the learner index so as

1439
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,880
I mentioned the learner index is always

1440
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,960
price Minus cost of a price if you have

1441
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,039
social

1442
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:18,000
preferences the

1443
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:20,359
cost is a modified cost which includes

1444
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,440
your social

1445
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:25,040
responsibility multiply by Alpha I which

1446
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,000
is your internalization of social

1447
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,080
welfare

1448
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:35,400
and the social responsibility index in a

1449
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:36,560
sense is as a very simple expression

1450
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:40,120
which

1451
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,759
reflects um what happens when you change

1452
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:45,759
your Mor action or you change your

1453
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:53,440
price here I forgot to say that W is

1454
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:53,440
equal W of AI and WJ is equal to wjf a

1455
01:08:53,480 --> 01:09:00,920
right so and sigma

1456
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:05,719
I is basically

1457
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:09,719
the the displacement so for example if

1458
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,440
I acquires one consumer the question is

1459
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:13,799
where does this consumer come from it

1460
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:17,560
can come from

1461
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:19,199
either uh firm J or from the outside

1462
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,600
option because this consumer was not

1463
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,799
consuming before that's why we have J

1464
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,359
greater than zero to include the

1465
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:29,120
adoption and what matters is a

1466
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:33,199
difference in terms of welfare

1467
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:35,279
consequences between I and J and sum of

1468
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:38,640
Sigma is equal to

1469
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:41,719
one okay so it's a

1470
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:44,440
weighted you look at you ask it's it's

1471
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:47,839
really about the replacement effect you

1472
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:50,120
look at if I acquire one more

1473
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:52,080
consumer I am I going to increase

1474
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,360
pollution or reduce pollution well that

1475
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:59,120
depends where where I get this uh

1476
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:01,239
consumer from right so if I I get it

1477
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:04,199
from someone who was produ producing

1478
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:05,440
using coal that's a good thing even if I

1479
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:10,000
use

1480
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,760
gas but if I get this consumer from

1481
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,800
someone who has actually using

1482
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:18,320
Renewables that's a bad thing if I'm

1483
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,440
using gas okay so so basically you look

1484
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,080
at the

1485
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,320
impact on welfare but for that you have

1486
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,880
to

1487
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,640
know you know whom are you you stealing

1488
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,640
consumers

1489
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,640
from

1490
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,320
okay okay so so that's why in your

1491
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,520
course you also take into account your

1492
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:42,679
social responsibility which means that

1493
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,679
if you are highly

1494
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,199
polluting actually your social

1495
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:51,320
responsibility is actually to

1496
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:53,640
leave the activity to other firms if you

1497
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,159
are highly ethical your social

1498
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:59,400
responsibility is to take Market to

1499
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:01,840
increase your market share okay which

1500
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:06,400
which kind of makes sense

1501
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,400
right now if you have a symmetric

1502
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:12,800
eum okay if you have a symmetric eum

1503
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:14,400
then wi is equal top WJ let's assume

1504
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,640
that the market is covered so the

1505
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:20,040
outside option is not nobody chooses the

1506
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:23,840
outside option everybody needs a

1507
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:26,199
doctor um and basically then W is equal

1508
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,600
to WJ and then

1509
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:30,199
your social responsibility is zero

1510
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:33,080
because you're all the

1511
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:34,640
same um in that case the larner index is

1512
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:38,040
a standard learner index if you have a

1513
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,159
symmetric equum okay but the basic point

1514
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:45,880
is that under pretty weak

1515
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:48,679
assumption um then you get multiple for

1516
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:53,920
given prices you get often multiple

1517
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:56,159
ethical Norms in AUM that's easy to get

1518
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:59,880
because of those strategy complement

1519
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:03,719
ities okay whereas when you look at

1520
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:07,679
flexible prices you get a very different

1521
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:09,840
picture um which is that if you have

1522
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:13,120
flexible

1523
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:15,520
prices your moral behavior is never

1524
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,960
going to depend on the demand

1525
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,520
curve so it's going to be the same for a

1526
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:22,520
monopolist or for an

1527
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:26,159
oligopolist it's the same for an

1528
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:28,600
oligopolist an oropo and a cartel

1529
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:32,080
uh the demand care whether they're

1530
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:34,400
highly substable or not doesn't matter

1531
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,840
so if prices are

1532
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,600
flexible

1533
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,840
actually then competitive pressure

1534
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,639
doesn't matter which is important

1535
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:47,840
because it tells you just go ahead with

1536
01:12:44,639 --> 01:12:51,920
competition policy those are two s

1537
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:55,840
things more Behavior will depend on how

1538
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,639
more the stakeholders are but will not

1539
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,560
depend on demand curve so will not

1540
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:04,199
depend on the intensity of

1541
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:06,600
competition okay so actually in that

1542
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:09,239
case I

1543
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:13,120
mean

1544
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:17,520
so so put

1545
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:19,960
differently if you have a price

1546
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,800
optimization you know that you're going

1547
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:25,199
to get

1548
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:26,800
this price will be equal to the index

1549
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,360
perhaps Modified by the social

1550
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:32,560
responsibility but it's always the case

1551
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:35,719
that if you if you have price

1552
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:38,560
competition the learner index is equal

1553
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:42,040
to the inverse vity of demand so that

1554
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:45,760
will be equal to one and basically this

1555
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:49,199
entity will be equal to to one as well

1556
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:53,400
okay and basically your M Behavior

1557
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:55,480
indexed by a dagger will be given by C

1558
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,880
equation which means that it's

1559
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:59,840
completely independent of the demand

1560
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:01,440
curve

1561
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,639
okay

1562
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:07,280
so whenever prices are

1563
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:08,600
flexible the intensity of competition is

1564
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,000
completely

1565
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,280
irrelevant and then therefore there is

1566
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
no

1567
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,480
point not doing antitrust because you

1568
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,600
want to increase morality because you're

1569
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,480
not going to increase morality

1570
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:25,159
anyway it's going to remain

1571
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:27,960
constant okay what is intuition

1572
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:29,159
let me give you two two intuition for

1573
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:31,080
whatever they are

1574
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:33,920
worth the

1575
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:35,520
first is to understand there are two

1576
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,560
offsetting

1577
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:40,440
effects

1578
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:43,280
so take a particular case so we're going

1579
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:47,199
to take a par case which is a worry of

1580
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:50,639
many people uh the fact the replacement

1581
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:54,280
effect so you know the idea that I might

1582
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:56,800
want to bribe a an official because

1583
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,480
otherwise I will Lo the market so

1584
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,920
irresponsible

1585
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:04,360
consumers so with irresponsible consumer

1586
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,719
if I cut ethical corner so if I reduce

1587
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:08,639
my

1588
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:11,840
morality I gain market share because

1589
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:15,239
that's exactly what the corrupt official

1590
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:19,920
the dictator or the up consumer

1591
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:21,400
wants okay so if I behave less mly I

1592
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,520
again market

1593
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,480
share

1594
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,199
okay now

1595
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:31,120
if you change theity of demand so you

1596
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:33,600
increase theity of Demand by having more

1597
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:38,440
competition then that means

1598
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:40,719
that um I will get more market share for

1599
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:43,520
you know I will get a bigger increase in

1600
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:47,120
market share if I behave more less

1601
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:49,840
morly okay so that seems to confirm the

1602
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,440
conventional wisdom that actually with

1603
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,480
ir responsible consumer markets will

1604
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:59,920
lead to immoral Behavior because then

1605
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:02,960
you by by cutting AAL corner you

1606
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:05,760
actually gain a lot of market share but

1607
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,239
the same time if you

1608
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,760
have more competition you also have

1609
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:13,360
lower

1610
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:16,360
markups right and if you have lower

1611
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,199
markups that means you gain Less in

1612
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,280
terms of money whenever you acquire

1613
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:21,800
market

1614
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:24,360
share and that makes you know you have a

1615
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,920
trade-off between behaving morly and

1616
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,920
making money

1617
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:33,960
okay but when you behave immorally you

1618
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:37,239
make less money per unit on more units

1619
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,440
in a sense and and those two effects

1620
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:41,239
actually perfectly offset that that of

1621
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,400
course I'm not showing you I'm just

1622
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:46,360
showing you there are two of two effects

1623
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:50,600
which go in the opposite directions

1624
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:53,400
right I mean if everybody made zero at

1625
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:56,800
the margin nobody will have incentive to

1626
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,600
behave immorally right

1627
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,760
if you if you if you don't make any

1628
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,040
money from

1629
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,760
misbehaving then you'll behave Mor if

1630
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,159
you have any social preferences even

1631
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:09,000
weak

1632
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:11,840
ones right and competition is going to

1633
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,320
reduce the stake in a sense so it's

1634
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,960
going to push toward more Mor Behavior

1635
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:20,199
so you have two effects and and they

1636
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,800
offet the other way to see is some kind

1637
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:25,280
of cost

1638
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:26,960
minimization so

1639
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:29,520
and that explain why they perfectly

1640
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:32,719
offset in a sense so when you look at

1641
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:34,320
your cost as a function of AI is C AI

1642
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:38,040
but

1643
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:41,080
then you you also have to add fire of AI

1644
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:44,360
because fire of AI is basically the

1645
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:48,239
perceived price increase due to

1646
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:49,920
AI uh for the consumer so you have if

1647
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:53,600
you want to keep your demon concern you

1648
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:56,440
have to reduce your price by fire of

1649
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,120
AI okay

1650
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:01,840
and then there is your social

1651
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,679
responsibility which I Rew wrote here so

1652
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:07,719
reing my

1653
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:10,520
J is the fraction of consumers that you

1654
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:12,159
steal from firm J whenever you acquire

1655
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,760
new

1656
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:18,400
consumers um and then I rewrote slightly

1657
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,639
differently the objective function so I

1658
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,560
have to take into account the difference

1659
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:25,880
between uh the welfare that I offer and

1660
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:29,400
the welfare which is offered by my

1661
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:32,840
competitors okay and when you look at

1662
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:37,520
this you know you given that some of

1663
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:41,080
Sigma is equal to one you

1664
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:45,600
can you can rewrite it this way in a

1665
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:47,040
part which as a part which depends on on

1666
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,880
on my own

1667
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:54,920
action and another part which depends on

1668
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:57,639
on the prices the net prices but also on

1669
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,840
the action of the rivals including the

1670
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:04,040
outside option and it's completely

1671
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,520
separable so that means that okay that I

1672
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:10,719
cannot do anything

1673
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:13,679
about um you know when I for given net

1674
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:16,159
prices I can just minimize cost and that

1675
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:20,400
gives me the formula which is within the

1676
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:25,400
previous page okay

1677
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,920
uh so um

1678
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:30,000
that's

1679
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,480
proof now how how robust is this

1680
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,320
conclusion of

1681
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,880
irrelevance uh it's not fully robust but

1682
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,360
it's actually pretty

1683
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,239
robust uh more than we would have

1684
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:44,480
thought

1685
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:46,360
so for example the irrelevance of again

1686
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,440
the irrelevance is that the intensity of

1687
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:52,480
competition has no impact on the choice

1688
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:56,440
of moral morality if prices are

1689
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,880
flexible um you can use Coro in that

1690
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,760
case you don't choose a price you choose

1691
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,320
a

1692
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,360
quantity but that's still the case that

1693
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:08,719
works you can use a search model it also

1694
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:13,440
works um if you have imperfect consumer

1695
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:17,560
information that works um if you

1696
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:20,719
have um different internalization I give

1697
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:23,000
you a specific internalization you can

1698
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,040
generalize to nonlinear pricing so I've

1699
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,600
assume you need demands but you could

1700
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:31,679
multi-unit demands that will also work

1701
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:34,440
and so on as non-constant return to

1702
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:37,560
scale is important for the result but

1703
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,480
you know you can relax it somewhat so

1704
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,080
for

1705
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:44,360
example if

1706
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:47,080
uh if A6 impact only the demand side but

1707
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:49,440
not the cost side doesn't matter you

1708
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:53,120
could have decreasing or increasing

1709
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:55,440
return to scale and so on so it's pretty

1710
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:58,360
robust um

1711
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,920
where things are

1712
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:03,560
different and I probably I would stop

1713
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:07,040
here because you

1714
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:09,679
is if you

1715
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:12,360
have if you if you don't have flexible

1716
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:15,199
prices then see it's a different ball

1717
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,639
game so I actually it suggest lots of

1718
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:19,159
ampirical

1719
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:21,960
tests um they actually a couple of

1720
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:24,600
experiments which have been run which

1721
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:26,639
fit relatively well with this Theory but

1722
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,560
you know it's only two experiments we

1723
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:31,000
need more experiments and we need also

1724
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,960
someone pay Cod work in general to to

1725
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,960
check all those things but

1726
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:39,239
um

1727
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:41,040
so what we do is okay let's assume first

1728
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:44,440
you have regulated

1729
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:47,280
price okay if you have a regulated price

1730
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,679
you have no reduced markup effects of

1731
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,520
intense

1732
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:54,600
competition okay competition reduces the

1733
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,480
markup and therefore reduces the stakes

1734
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,360
in Behaving IM

1735
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,960
morly whereas if you have fixed prices

1736
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:03,440
that's not going to happen competition

1737
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:08,440
is not going to reduce the

1738
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:11,360
price um in that case the critiques of

1739
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:13,000
markets are right which is if you have

1740
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,560
irresponsible

1741
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,000
consumers then more competition is going

1742
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:21,960
to reduce more Behavior that's

1743
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,199
correct so if you make the Assumption to

1744
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,719
a unique equum you can show that

1745
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:29,159
actually more Behavior decreases with

1746
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:31,440
more competition so there's a grain of

1747
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:33,440
Truth in the criticism it's not like

1748
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,320
it's completely wrong there's a grain of

1749
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:38,040
truth but you have to qualify it

1750
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,560
substantially not only because of the

1751
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:44,880
irrelevance result but even when the

1752
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:46,600
prices are fixed then um you also get

1753
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,320
the reverse conclusion when you have

1754
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,800
responsible

1755
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:53,280
consumer it's pretty clear what happens

1756
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:56,440
is that if you have responsible consumer

1757
01:22:53,280 --> 01:23:00,159
so we all want Fair Trade

1758
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:01,400
coffee then actually more competition is

1759
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:05,239
going to

1760
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:07,639
force um the firms actually to buy Fair

1761
01:23:05,239 --> 01:23:09,920
Trade coffee you know because they want

1762
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:12,360
to please a customer so it's going to be

1763
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:15,199
exactly the reverse so if you have

1764
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:19,639
responsible consumers then competition

1765
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:22,920
is good for marity so if you had those

1766
01:23:19,639 --> 01:23:25,040
those things which is the relevance

1767
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,960
result plus this slide

1768
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:31,639
you see that first it's not the case

1769
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:34,000
that everything goes um you have

1770
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:37,440
prediction but there are context

1771
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,120
specific is the price flexible or not

1772
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:43,440
are the consumers irresponsible or

1773
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:46,239
responsible those are not the same

1774
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:49,320
applications and you get a picture which

1775
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:51,679
you say okay we we we cannot conclude

1776
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:53,840
and you're just modifying antitrust and

1777
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,719
all those things just on the basis of

1778
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:59,840
morality it doesn't seem like the right

1779
01:23:55,719 --> 01:24:02,639
thing to do now if the if the policy

1780
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,520
makers use a final analysis maybe that's

1781
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:07,679
that's the right thing to do but you

1782
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:10,760
cannot just say we don't want markets

1783
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:13,800
right that's not that's not the right

1784
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:17,360
stance now last thing we do in the paper

1785
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,440
I think is to look at what happens when

1786
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,800
you

1787
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:23,080
introduce either heterogenity in in

1788
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,840
Social

1789
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,760
preferences okay

1790
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:30,480
imagine one of the competitors is Mo

1791
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:32,600
terasa right um what happens well she

1792
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:35,320
might ear a limited liability

1793
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:38,480
constrain right because you know at some

1794
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:41,000
point she will run out of cash or if you

1795
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:43,560
have for profit and you know that then

1796
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,159
it it it becomes more interesting and

1797
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,119
there might be an argument in some

1798
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:50,840
Industries actually to protect the not

1799
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:52,360
for profit from the competition of for

1800
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,600
profit because what we show is that when

1801
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:56,360
you have very intense competition you

1802
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,679
tend to have

1803
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:01,639
mimicking the behavior or mimic between

1804
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:02,920
for-profit and not for-profit the

1805
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:05,800
distinction

1806
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,679
disappears basically the the for-profit

1807
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,880
to compete with the not for-profit have

1808
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:14,639
to choose prices close to marginal cost

1809
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:17,760
but the the not for profit have to

1810
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:20,000
behave unethically to keep consumers if

1811
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,880
consumers are

1812
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,880
irresponsible and you see that you know

1813
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,880
you lose a little bit the the

1814
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,280
distinction between not for profit and

1815
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,400
and for profit in that case and that

1816
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:34,280
raises the issue about whether you want

1817
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:37,440
to reserve the hospital Market or the

1818
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:41,040
education Market to not where where

1819
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:43,159
moral issues can be very important to uh

1820
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,560
to not for-profit and we don't solve

1821
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:48,520
this issue but it's actually a very

1822
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,520
interesting issue to study
