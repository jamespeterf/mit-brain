2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,080
so this experiment deals with hydrogen

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,000
peroxide which everybody has at home I'm

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,759
going to do a reaction today using a

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,960
man-made Catalyst manganes dioxide and

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,480
I've got some hydrogen peroxide here and

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,560
this man-made Catalyst will speed up the

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,560
reaction about a thousand

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,119
[Applause]

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,000
times and I'm going to step out of the

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,000
way for a moment

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,480
so you can see the the enormous amount

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,680
of heat that was given off because the

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,520
bottle has actually shrunk compared to

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,440
the bottle next to it it's very hot

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,399
right now for more MIT moments from MIT
