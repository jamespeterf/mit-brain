00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
My name is Tomás, and I'm a

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,120
high school student in

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,880
Chile. My story with MIT CW

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,240
began when my classmates and I were developing

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,120
a

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,400
school innovation project: a

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,880
phytopharmaceutical first-aid kit. This kit was going to be

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,519
implemented in

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,000
school nursing units, allowing us to

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,760
address students'

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,160
health problems. The

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,160
problem we encountered while developing this

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,279
research was that we lacked

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,880
the necessary

15
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:34,440
pharmacology knowledge. That's when the

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,120
MIT CW course on Principles of Pharmacology came along.

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,280
This allowed me to gain a foundation in

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,800
pharmacology, and, I believe even more importantly, to

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,000
share this knowledge with

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,399
my classmates. I think what I

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,079
value most about MIT CW is the wide variety of

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,800
content available; for me, it's the ultimate

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,800
expression of the democratization of

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
knowledge.
