1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,320
To participate in this next exercise,

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,400
you'll have to grab um one of these uh

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
uh index cards that are on the table

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,840
that correspond to a particular

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
technology. It looks like film, radio,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,720
and television are amongst the remaining

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,119
ones. Um and you'll get in small groups

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,439
um and uh work on those. Here's what I'd

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,239
like you to do. Find the other people

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,600
who have the same card as you. Um, uh,

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,719
discuss what you learned from the

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,879
readings, anything that sort of stands

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
out to you, comes to your mind. But then

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,640
I want you to make a chart, which you

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,160
can do on the whiteboard or on our um,

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,320
blue pieces of paper there. Um, that uh,

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,920
that capture sort of three key ideas.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,399
First of all, who are all of the

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
stakeholders who are involved in the

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,760
implementation of this technology? One

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,160
of the things that I think Larry Cubin

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
is particularly wonderful at um is

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,799
giving you a sense of all of the

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,960
different hands that touch a technology

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,320
making its way into a school and all the

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,920
different hands that touch a technology

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,479
when it's in the school. This is

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,159
incredibly important for understanding

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,600
how technologies actually get used um in

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,119
in sort of a lot of times in like

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,479
canonical design. And I think this comes

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,080
up in sort of software engineering

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,280
classes and things like this idea that

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,119
like there's a programmer and a user and

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
the user is like one person who's

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,840
sitting at a keyboard with their fingers

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
on the keyboard and like that's the

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
person you need to pay attention to. And

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
that like two-part model of like

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,040
designer and user totally breaks down in

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,720
schools. Um there are lots of people who

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
are very different who could be

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,600
considered users of technology in

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,680
schools. Um, another thing that's that

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,360
Larry Cubin does really well is he he he

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
helps us pay attention to how these

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,920
people have what I'll call different

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,159
interests. By interests, I don't mean

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,520
curiosities. I mean like incentives,

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
stakes, sort of how a political

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,439
scientist might use the word interest.

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,680
Um, all of these different stakeholders

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,399
are rewarded for different kinds of

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,879
things. Um, they also have what we'll

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,040
call disinterests or disincentives. they

56
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,040
are also trying to avoid or will be

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,040
punished for different kinds of things.

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,480
Um so for the technology that you that

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,080
you picked a card of and are talking

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
with your colleagues about think of all

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
of the different people who you think

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,520
could be considered stakeholders in the

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
implementation of this thing. What and

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
then for each of those stakeholders come

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
up with like a couple of their interests

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,959
and a couple of their disinterests or

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,720
disincentives or things that punish them

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,040
or those kinds of things. Does that as a

69
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,400
general exercise make sense? Um, and the

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,800
thing that we're trying to do together

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
is around we want to we want to try to

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
recreate the world around these

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,519
technologies. That's what I think Larry

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,280
Cuban is so fabulous at, um, is saying

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,720
like, yep, a television set is going to

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
roll into a but it's going to roll into

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
a classroom and into a school and into a

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,760
community and there's all these people

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
who are part of that. Um, that's what we

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
really need to get out here. I'll tell

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
the last thing I'll tell you before I

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,680
cut you loose um, is Larry Cuban has a

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,680
totally fascinating history himself. He

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
was a social studies teacher in the 50s

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,120
and 60s. Then he was a school principal.

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
Then he was a superintendent. He was

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,840
actually the superintendent in

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,360
Arlington, Virginia. Um which is where

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
my wife went to school. So when my wife

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
was an elementary school student, um uh

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,680
her her superintendent at the time was

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,040
Larry Cuban. Um and are Arlington,

93
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,920
Virginia. Fairfax. Close enough. Yeah.

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,599
Yeah. Um and it was only after he had

95
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,040
like a pretty distinguished career as a

96
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,280
teacher, a principal, a superintendent

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,400
that he went to Stanford. Um got his

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,799
dissertation. um became a historian of

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,159
education and then eventually a a

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
history of education professor out

101
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,840
there. Um so he's someone who's like

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,040
extremely well read as I'm sure you got

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
a sense of and things like that, but he

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,400
also just deeply understands the kinds

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
of things that make schools tick and

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,319
make the people inside schools tick.

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
Does this exercise make sense? Find the

108
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,360
people with your cards. Move yourselves

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
around. Make this little chart either on

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
the board or on these blue pieces of

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,879
paper. Ready? Go.

112
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,560
That's a little bit th those things are

113
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,920
those things are hugely important you

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
know like like what like where does

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,400
teaching actually happen like there's

116
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,159
some human being you know who like needs

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,599
to go to the bathroom and needs to eat

118
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,959
and I mean he has that great quote in

119
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,720
there it's not about film but television

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
that they found that they're more likely

121
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
to use television in the afternoon than

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,880
in the mornings. Um and it and it all

123
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,799
it's all like biology and culture like

124
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
our brains work better in the morning.

125
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,400
We're all a little flagging by the

126
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,479
afternoon. Those kinds of things. Um,

127
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,880
and so yeah, I think that like anybody

128
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,560
who's building a technology has to think

129
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,400
to themselves like, you know, what are

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
you? Yeah. Yeah. What like what are the

131
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
variations in a teacher's day? Like when

132
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,440
do they have more energy or less energy?

133
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
How does it fit into those kinds of

134
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
cycles and things like that? Like those

135
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,680
are every bit as real as you know the

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,919
test score goals that we have or

137
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,919
anything else.

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
This is really good. This is really

139
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,440
good. Take a few more minutes. Take a

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,440
few more minutes.

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
We're trying to think about interest for

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,039
schools for producers. Sure. So, if

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,880
you're a school, so if you're a school,

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,400
what would make you go, h I'm not sure I

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,840
want to do anything with films. It's so

146
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,919
it's 1913. Um, silent films, you know,

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,360
started coming out in earnest around the

148
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,000
turn of the century. There's a handful

149
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,919
of people um one, you know, the most

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
prominent of them is Thomas Edison. You

151
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,520
know, a guy invents a light bulb. Um and

152
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
he gets in front of Congress and he

153
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,039
says, you know, he's first in 1913, he

154
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
says, I mean, I'll read the other quote,

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,560
but he says, um, in a decade, textbooks

156
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,160
will be replaced by film strips. That's

157
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,840
how powerful this new technology is

158
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
going to be. Um, if you're a school

159
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,240
principal, what would be some things

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,600
that make you go, you're pretty smart,

161
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
Thomas, but I'm not so sure about this

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
one?

163
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,039
Maybe if they just put a bunch of money

164
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,440
into textbooks. Sure. So yeah, they have

165
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,520
an entire infrastructure built around

166
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,280
the existing technologies. They h they

167
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,520
have shelves on the wall. They have

168
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,759
libraries full of books. Every one of

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,000
their teachers has been trained to teach

170
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
with textbooks. And not a single one of

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
their teachers in you know when these

172
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,440
things are first introduced has ever

173
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,600
been in a class as a student learning

174
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,000
from a film. So you have this huge

175
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
inherent conservatism in the system. So

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,840
that could be one. What would be what

177
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,840
would be some others?

178
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,720
I mean, yeah. I mean, I I guess it's

179
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,199
kind of adding on to that, but like

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
integrating it into like a classroom

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,319
setting, like how how would they even

182
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
like

183
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
uh integrate into like even even if

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
they're like completely on board like

185
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
like what how would they even integrate

186
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,240
it into a classroom? What for films?

187
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,759
What would be what would be some of the

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,280
challenges of integration?

189
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,880
Um like

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,080
the technology that you would need to

191
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,919
like uh put into a classroom or like to

192
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
a school. Say tell me specifically for

193
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,479
films what some of that technology might

194
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,720
be. Um I mean like isn't I I don't think

195
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,400
like the the projectors in like back

196
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,160
then could like fit into like a

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
classroom. Oh, they so they could I mean

198
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
you know like they're they're portable

199
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,960
enough but they're big. They're these

200
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,479
like big lumbering machines for which

201
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,560
the rooms are like if you have if you

202
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,720
have a classroom like let's say you have

203
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,880
a big population growth and so you're

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,599
you're you built you you know someone in

205
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,960
the 1850s built a school and it was 12

206
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,039
kids per classroom and now you're

207
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,639
putting 18 kids per classroom in there.

208
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,199
Like a totally legitimate reason would

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
be there is not space in this room to

210
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,240
physically move this machine. Like what

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
are some other sort of what else do you

212
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
need for films as a technology to be

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,599
able to be implemented? Do you need a

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,599
giant projector? You're going to put

215
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,280
thing on wheels. What else do you need?

216
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,240
A place to actually project it onto.

217
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,919
Okay, good. You're going to have to go

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
to all your classrooms and you're going

219
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,039
to have to install screens at the front

220
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
of the room. Like not the hugest

221
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,199
challenge, but also not free, you know,

222
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,560
not like like so who's going to do these

223
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,360
things? Um, you know, the uh the films

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,879
also came on these like huge reels. Um,

225
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,039
you know, it wasn't just like, you know,

226
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,720
pick your YouTube channel and play like

227
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,960
where in your building are you going to

228
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
keep a library of film reels? Who's

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,759
going to organize those libraries of

230
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,759
film reels? Like um you know if you have

231
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
four elementary schools in an or four

232
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
elementary classroom like let's say have

233
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,960
four first grades, are you going to buy

234
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,400
four copies of this film so that

235
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,759
everyone can watch it at the same time?

236
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,479
If not, how are you going to like

237
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,240
physically organize and move like this

238
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,520
giant reel from one space to another?

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
Those are all those are all you know you

240
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,800
could imagine the principal being like

241
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
but how are we but how are we but how

242
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
are we but how are we and all this stuff

243
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,399
costs money. Um, so those are all kinds

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,839
of, you know, like like, you know,

245
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,200
Thomas Edison is here telling you that

246
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,560
you're going to get 100% efficient

247
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,560
learning through this thing, which is

248
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,000
the potential gains, which you no one

249
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,440
has any evidence for because it hasn't

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
happened yet. But you've got to think to

251
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,399
yourself like like what are all these

252
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,760
costs? What are all these material

253
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,880
changes? Yeah. So think about how you

254
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,640
can articulate some of those things. But

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,320
good like when you really get like, you

256
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
know, for to to do this exercise, well,

257
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
you have to like what exactly is this

258
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,000
technology? Like like even physically,

259
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
what does it require? How many of these

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,800
things do you need to buy? How much do

261
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,240
they cost? All that kind of stuff. How

262
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,240
reusable are they? Um,

263
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
okay. This is really good. Why don't we

264
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,200
take a break here? Um, go ahead and you

265
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
can sit back down to the seats that you

266
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,120
were at. Um, I think everyone's written

267
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,680
kind of broadly enough um that we'll be

268
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
able to see from a

269
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,800
distance. But yeah, really good. Really

270
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,320
good. Now I need to find a little spot

271
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,080
for me to um

272
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
everyone's last minute notes. Every

273
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,560
Yeah. Yeah. Now is your chance to put

274
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,880
the final the final few things up there.

275
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Um good. So every What was the minimum

276
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,120
number of stakeholders people came up

277
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,959
with? Um these guys are the winners with

278
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,440
the longest list. Let's just read it out

279
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,640
loud. Co. Oh no. The state admin,

280
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
parents, teachers, students,

281
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,959
corporations, manufacturers, edtech

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,600
investors, developers, policy makers.

283
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,640
Great. So, just as a starting point, I

284
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,640
mean, there are some other ones that

285
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,680
showed up around here, studios,

286
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,600
broadcasters, the FCC, um, that sort of

287
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,920
different psychologists. Yeah, there are

288
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,000
a lot of people who have something at

289
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,720
stake in these decisions. They're

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,800
complex, multihuman kinds of decisions.

291
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,680
So, that's a good start. Um, let me just

292
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
read. Um, so given how complex these

293
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,920
things are, why are folks so

294
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,839
enthusiastic about it? Let's ask Thomas

295
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,760
Edison. Um, what does Thomas Edison

296
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,000
think about this? I believe that the

297
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,480
motion picture is destined to

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
revolutionize our educational system and

299
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
that in a few years it will supplant

300
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,120
largely if not entirely the use of

301
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,440
textbooks. I should say that on the

302
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
average we get about 2% efficiency out

303
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,200
of school books as they are written

304
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,399
today. You're laughing. Why are you

305
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,279
laughing? Thomas Edison is just here

306
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,480
making up. He doesn't 2% that

307
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,920
doesn't mean a thing. He was good at

308
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,640
light bulbs. He wasn't maybe as good at

309
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,240
this. Um, the education of the future as

310
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
I see it will be conducted through the

311
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,640
medium of the motion picture where it

312
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,120
should be possible to obtain 100%

313
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,480
efficiency. Thomas Edison 1922. Um,

314
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
you'll read a couple of other quotes

315
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
that I have from Thomas Edison. One of

316
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,240
them is in here in in failure to disrupt

317
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,079
when you read that. But in 1913, he went

318
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
in front of Congress and said in 10

319
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,959
years the textbook will entire will be

320
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,920
entirely replaced by um film strips. And

321
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,800
then he went back 10 years later in 1923

322
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,839
and he said in 20 years textbooks will

323
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,720
be entirely replaced by film strips. Um

324
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,279
I think you can find many similar kinds

325
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,600
of arguments that are made today. Um I

326
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,120
think you will not have a hard time um

327
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,120
finding people who tell you that the

328
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,279
oldfashioned techniques are only 2%

329
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,279
efficient but the new ones will be 100%

330
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,240
efficient. Um so that's the promise. the

331
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
promise is that we could do

332
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
substantially better than we're doing

333
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,120
right now if we if we think about

334
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,079
implementing all of these uh different

335
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
kinds of technologies. Um so an

336
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,240
intuition that you can develop um is

337
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,880
that this is this is a century old

338
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,880
enterprise. Um for the last 100 110

339
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,639
years people have thought how can we

340
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,480
take analog technologies and eventually

341
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,959
digital technologies bring them into

342
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,639
schools to improve learning. Um there

343
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,040
are millions of people who work on

344
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,600
education. Many of them are very very

345
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,279
smart. Um from the earliest, you know,

346
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,519
you read a little bit about um uh

347
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,279
personal computers kind of from the 70s

348
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
and 80s, the Apple 2 plus kind of the

349
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,800
generation of computers that I grew up

350
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,600
with, but that's actually like 20 years

351
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,000
into the game. Um from the moment people

352
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,839
built computers the size of this room,

353
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,279
um computer scientists, educators,

354
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,639
learning scientists partnered together

355
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,720
to try to figure out if there's some way

356
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
to use computers to teach people. So, so

357
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
just compute, you know, not even all

358
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
these other radio, film, other things.

359
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
Computing alone is like a 70-year

360
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
enterprise of trying to improve schools.

361
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,720
There are lots of things that we've

362
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,399
tried and learned in 70 years. So, one

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
intuition that I hope you will take away

364
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,399
from this class is that when you're

365
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,560
thinking about an education technology

366
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,920
problem of any form or type, about a

367
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,600
design problem, an implementation

368
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
problem, a policy problem, you should

369
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,880
think to yourself, we probably have done

370
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,279
something like this before. Um there is

371
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,279
nothing that is so new, so utterly

372
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,720
different that there aren't like cognate

373
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,560
examples that could help us think

374
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,200
through whatever these challenges are.

375
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,399
Um let's think about a couple of these

376
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,079
stakeholders. Which stakeholders seem to

377
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,839
appear pretty much in all of them?

378
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,160
What's who's who seem to be sort of

379
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,160
universal stakeholders?

380
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,959
Teachers. Teachers. Let's start with

381
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,639
them because they're the best. Um I I

382
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,360
love teachers. I would I mean definitely

383
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,160
one of the reasons why I do what I do is

384
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,680
I just think teachers are great.

385
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,720
Um what what kinds of things get

386
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,000
teachers excited? What what what if if

387
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,079
you're if you're if you want to get a

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
teacher using education technology, what

389
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,000
are the what are the felt needs that

390
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,120
they have that are going to be really

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
important to them? This is one that I

392
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,839
think will be pretty consistent across a

393
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,519
bunch of these, but we can see if there

394
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,720
are differences, too. Reducing their

395
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,600
workload. Okay, good. I love it.

396
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
reducing

397
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,560
workload. Why is that so important to

398
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,240
teachers?

399
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,320
It's because they have so much they have

400
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
so much to do. These are not people who

401
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,199
spend a bunch of time like sitting

402
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,440
around waiting for the phone to ring or

403
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,040
something like that. Um teacher workload

404
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
in the United States is actually in

405
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,000
certain ways like much higher than other

406
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
comparable OECD countries. So O is the

407
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
organization of economic cooperative

408
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
development something like that. It's

409
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,839
like rich countries 30 or 40 rich

410
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,040
countries. Um, American teachers

411
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,440
compared to our colleagues in other

412
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,279
countries spend more time in front of

413
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,360
students actually directly teaching than

414
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,279
in many other places. Um, so many other

415
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
countries in the world like a full-time

416
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,920
licensed teacher would have more

417
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,440
collaborative planning time, more

418
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,279
grading time, other kinds of things like

419
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
that. So, US teachers compared to their

420
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,880
colleagues around the world are like

421
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,720
behind the ball on having time anyway.

422
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
Um, reducing workload is something they

423
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
care about. What else do they care

424
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,160
about? Like it has to spark the students

425
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,920
interest. Good. So, they don't want kids

426
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,279
to be bored.

427
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,399
um that one of their one of their core

428
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
interests is how am I going to keep

429
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,800
these folks motivated? How am I going to

430
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,800
keep them learning? What else do they

431
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,800
care about? They care about it being of

432
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,560
actually good quality. Okay, good. So,

433
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:16,320
like it's really important that learning

434
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,480
goes up, that quality is high, um that

435
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,000
that you know that that uh teachers take

436
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,440
their professionalism very very

437
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,040
seriously and that you know and and

438
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
they're held accountable in various

439
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,399
kinds of ways. Um, and this could be

440
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
different across different kinds of

441
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,760
teachers. Um, so in the United States,

442
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,279
we primaril we we we test in in certain

443
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,720
kinds of ways. We test like way more

444
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,880
than every other country does. There's

445
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,639
no country that tests all of their

446
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,320
students every year, third to eighth

447
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
grade, in both reading and math. Most

448
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,600
other countries are like if you test

449
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
them in the third grade, you probably

450
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,560
wait a couple years to like, you know, I

451
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,240
mean, you give them like but you give

452
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,199
them assessments or exams or whatever,

453
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,800
but you don't give them like big

454
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,519
national tests. Um and so if you are a

455
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,920
teacher of reading or of math, um your

456
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,880
test scores are scrutinized in a way

457
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,480
that a science teacher, art teacher, a

458
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,800
health teacher, other kinds of teachers

459
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,160
are not similarly scrutinized. Um so

460
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,519
within the you know there could be

461
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,279
different kinds of incentives. One of

462
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,440
the things I always enjoyed about being

463
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,040
a history teacher is that there there

464
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,279
were never really tests that I were

465
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,560
preparing my students for. um in the

466
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,079
same way I taught in private school, but

467
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,360
even my math teacher colleagues like

468
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,040
felt like they were preparing students

469
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,040
for the SAT, for the APs, things like

470
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,120
that. That was never really my concern.

471
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
Um as a result, like I had to spend less

472
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,519
time thinking to myself, this new thing

473
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,079
I'm bringing in this classroom, is this

474
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,759
going to prepare people for some kind of

475
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,120
nearly universal testing experiences?

476
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,480
Like my math teacher colleagues always

477
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
had to be thinking about that. I could

478
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
be like, well, you know, Tibetan

479
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,079
Buddhism isn't on the test, but it's

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,399
awesome. Let's study it. Um you know, so

481
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,920
so that's different. Good. other kinds

482
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,240
of things. Yeah. Tai and then Sabrina.

483
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,480
Um accessibility and like inclusion. So

484
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,160
making sure that like no one's left out

485
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,959
from your diverse group of learners from

486
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,199
any technology.

487
00:16:53,959 --> 00:17:03,040
Yeah. Um and that would not be a

488
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,839
universal concern across these decades.

489
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,160
um that you know um uh it would it would

490
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,120
have been considered much more common to

491
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,280
say like certain people have totally

492
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,679
unsolvable learning disabilities and

493
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,439
society should tend to their welfare in

494
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
some other kind of way in the 30s and

495
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
40s and 50s and then somewhere in the

496
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,120
middle of the 20th century we passed um

497
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
the Americans with Disabilities Act um

498
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,319
which which totally transformed our

499
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,880
thoughts and in fact you know created a

500
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,640
federal right for people to have um you

501
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,520
know a a way of being a fair and

502
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,160
appropriate public education Um, and I

503
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,320
would also just say educa, like as

504
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,200
society has gotten more interested in

505
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,720
values of inclusion generally, um, what

506
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,799
people would have worried about with

507
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,559
inclusion with personal computers in the

508
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,520
1980s is very different for what they

509
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,559
would be worried about with the

510
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
computers that are getting in front of

511
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,520
their students right now. That's a great

512
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,480
one. I'm going to say being able to

513
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,880
track student progress.

514
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
Track

515
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
progress

516
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,360
assessment. Good. Yeah. I mean, actually

517
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,720
interesting over this uh century, you

518
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,240
know, um some of the earliest

519
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
technologies had nothing to do with

520
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,440
that, radio and film, but one of the

521
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,559
very earliest ones you read about um

522
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,000
physical teaching machines. Um uh and

523
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,400
hopefully you got I mean you saw some

524
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,559
pictures um I was just actually looking

525
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
today there was a Sydney Pressie is one

526
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,000
of the people who Audrey Waters writes

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
about. Um and there's somebody on

528
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
YouTube who had posted this like

529
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,960
fabulous two-minute clip of him

530
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,400
demonstrating one of his teacher

531
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
machines and unfortunately that account

532
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,799
was deleted before this year's class. Um

533
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,160
may maybe I'll send you a version of it

534
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,640
later. The only version of the video

535
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,360
still exists is one in which a nand

536
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,679
augur wall's voice is superimposed of

537
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,440
it. Um, so somebody took an audio clip

538
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,000
of Anand Agarwal talking about the

539
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,840
capacities of Edex. Um, and played the

540
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,919
audio over Sydney Pressy demonstrating

541
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,200
the teaching machine. Um, and uh, it's a

542
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,960
little too close for comfort even though

543
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
it's a century apart. Um, but teaching

544
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,400
machines, they were kind of like

545
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,080
typewriters. Um, they had these four

546
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,559
keys that were on them and so they would

547
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,559
display one question at a time. Um, it

548
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,679
was like pre-cantron technology, you

549
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,960
know, and then there would be one of

550
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,880
four possible answers. Um, in one of the

551
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
earliest versions, it had a little like

552
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,240
bank of mints in the back of them and so

553
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
when you press the right button, like a

554
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,200
little candy or something would roll out

555
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,440
and give you like a little behaviorist

556
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,440
positive, um, reinforcement kinds of

557
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,520
things. Um, but one, you know, one of

558
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,679
the main virtues of it was like, oh man,

559
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,480
if we could get enough people these

560
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,160
things, um, then we could like assess

561
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
their progress almost constantly. We'd

562
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,080
know exactly where they are. So, so this

563
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,000
idea of track, you

564
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,840
know, tracking student progress is

565
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,760
something that's like particularly

566
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,200
urgently concerned in our datadriven

567
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
world, but was still something that

568
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,760
people were interested in a century ago.

569
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,799
Um, what are what are some of the I'll

570
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,440
just put them under here. What are some

571
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,520
of the the the would be disincentives

572
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,960
for teachers? What are some things that

573
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,640
if you were trying to get teachers to

574
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,760
adopt new technologies would be the

575
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,840
sorts of things that would be barriers

576
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,799
for them? Complexity. Why complexity? A

577
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,480
lot of there's there's uh some teachers

578
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,000
who are more able to adapt to new

579
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,679
technologies and some teachers who just

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,080
cannot understand how certain

581
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,960
technologies might work. Yeah. So I so I

582
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,320
think I think that aptitude is right. I

583
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,000
also many like if you go into teaching

584
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,679
there probably probably two things that

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
really drive you. One is you love the

586
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,280
content that you teach. That's more true

587
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
for secondary educators than for early

588
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,120
elementary educators but probably true

589
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for them. And you probably love people.

590
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,919
um very difficult to be a teacher if you

591
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,760
don't find people especially young

592
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,520
people pretty engaging. the kinds of

593
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,960
folks who find people engaging, they

594
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,480
might just find tech, it's not 100%

595
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,760
overlap, but there just technology is

596
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
less engaging. Like they didn't want to

597
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
spend their life sitting in front of a

598
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,280
computer typing itself. They wanted to

599
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,960
be interacting with people.

600
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,679
Um, but the other thing I would say is

601
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,919
that there are many educators who spend

602
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,600
a lot of time polishing their craft and

603
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
are good at teaching the way they're

604
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,919
teaching right now and have been

605
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,520
teaching for the last decade. And so

606
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,440
when they see a new piece of technology

607
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,280
come in, they're thinking to themselves,

608
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,880
is this thing really going to be better

609
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
than the thing that I've been doing and

610
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,960
got good at for a while, um, you know,

611
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,039
what am I g what am I I'm going to have

612
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,880
to lose something when I integrate this

613
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,640
new thing? Like like any technology

614
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
adoption involves loss. Any change

615
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,039
involves loss. You got to give something

616
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,520
up. Um, I think giving up it may be

617
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,760
pretty good. Um, a lot I think a lot of

618
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,600
people think that older teachers because

619
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,559
are are less likely to adopt

620
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,840
technologies because they're not

621
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,240
technology fluent. But having worked

622
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,600
with many many teachers, I'm really

623
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,600
convinced that there's no relationship

624
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,200
between age and technology adoption.

625
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,159
There are young teachers that are super

626
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
interested and there are young teachers

627
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,520
who hate it. There are old teachers who

628
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,960
are like, I'm pretty good at what I do.

629
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,159
And there are old teachers who are old

630
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,840
teachers because they've spent the last

631
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,440
20 years going, it's really fun to try

632
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
new things. It's really fun to try to

633
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
get better. What was one of your

634
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,320
disincentives, Sabrina? uh student

635
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,720
distraction.

636
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,240
Great. And obviously some of these

637
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,600
technologies are more akin to that than

638
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
others. Like if you're playing a film

639
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
strip or something like that, like you

640
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,200
probably have kids attention or things

641
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,520
like that. Um but uh certainly as we get

642
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,679
into computers, any anything in which

643
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,360
you know the the attention is where

644
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
where each student is responsible for

645
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,840
their own attention um is something that

646
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,600
that uh can can raise concerns for

647
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,159
teachers because kids like to be attend

648
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,000
to all kinds of things. What what other

649
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
things would be disincentives like

650
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,360
teacher displacement like they feel like

651
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,120
they're being replaced? Yep. Um so

652
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,600
teachers are a profession um you know

653
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,039
that that protects their job security

654
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
with a license and things like that like

655
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,240
lots of other professions do like

656
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,120
doctors and pharmacists and lawyers and

657
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,400
all kinds of people. Um and uh yeah and

658
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
yeah but most professionals are not

659
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,360
super enthusiastic about technology that

660
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,039
has the capacity to replace the

661
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,320
functions that they're doing.

662
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,679
Um, good. Let's think about some of

663
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,360
these other um, so, so this is a good

664
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,000
one. So, so again, we could think about

665
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,960
anytime a new technology is being

666
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,640
introduced, is it going to reduce

667
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,320
workload? Is it going to spark interest?

668
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
Will it spark interest in the first

669
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,520
three weeks of this new technology being

670
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,720
here, will it spark interest two years

671
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,400
after the technology has been

672
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,000
introduced? Is it going to be of high

673
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,480
quality? Do I have control over the

674
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,919
quality? Um, accessible inclusion, is it

675
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
going to improve learning? Will it be

676
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,000
able to track assessment? Is it too

677
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,440
complex? Will it like distract my

678
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,600
students? Is it going to displace

679
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,200
essential functions that I perform? Um,

680
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,880
those are like that is a good set of

681
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
questions that you could ask, you know,

682
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
that Cuban does ask in some ways of

683
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
radio and film and television and

684
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,240
teaching machines and computers. Um, and

685
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
you could ask them of AI and Khan

686
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,360
Academy and I civics and anything else

687
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
that comes along. Like these are all

688
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,640
still good questions to ask. Um, let's

689
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,679
try to hit now a bunch of these other

690
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,200
stakeholders. Um, who are who are some

691
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,159
of the stakeholders that surprised you?

692
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,280
Who are the ones that you were like,

693
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,240
"Whoa, I wouldn't have thought of this

694
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,240
in terms of education

695
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,559
technology, weird ones or unique ones."

696
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,320
I mean, I thought like my group was the

697
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,720
teacher machines and it was like the

698
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,039
psychologists that like come up with the

699
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,120
ideas um that go into how these

700
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,919
technologies are or what they're based

701
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,000
on. Um like I guess I never just never

702
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,280
really thought like oh like you know it

703
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
is the people who like thought of

704
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,039
constructivism and like situated

705
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,760
learning that has then sparked this

706
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,840
interest in everything else. Um and so

707
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,360
it's like people have ideas but all of

708
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,120
that initially stemmed from these like

709
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,279
two thoughts of learning. Good. Yeah. So

710
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,480
so so people have ideas about what good

711
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,559
teaching and learning should be like.

712
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,919
Those ideas are in some ways they seem

713
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,120
pretty universal because we can find

714
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,559
them going back through history but

715
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
they're als they're always being

716
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,200
reinterpreted updated things like that.

717
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,520
Um Sydney Pressie is in this moment

718
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,679
where behaviorism is an incredibly

719
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,200
prominent set of you know set of ideas.

720
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,120
This behaviorism you're probably all

721
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,320
familiar with of you know you uh punish

722
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,159
people when they do things wrong and you

723
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,080
reward them when you do things right and

724
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,480
you condition their behavior that way.

725
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,279
Um and so he creates a physical machine

726
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,520
that embodies those ideas. Um there you

727
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,919
know and then you know Seymour Papert

728
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,760
will come along um and be like oh man

729
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,000
why can't we learn math the way that

730
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,760
like kids who go to visit France learn

731
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
French? um why can't we make a thing

732
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,520
which is math land? I bet logo could be

733
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,640
like math land. He has a set he have a

734
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,600
set of ideas about what good teaching

735
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,640
and learning looks like and he

736
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,880
incorporates those ideas. Um and they

737
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,000
and people become partisans of these

738
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,240
ideas. Um you know probably the most

739
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,760
prominent partisan of education

740
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,320
technology in the United States today is

741
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,559
Salon. Um who's someone who like had a

742
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,320
very particular idea like a like clear

743
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,760
vision of what personalized learning

744
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,039
would look like. you know, he had he had

745
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,080
I don't know if you know about his his

746
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,840
personal experience, but he was like a

747
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,640
hedge fund person or something like that

748
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,240
and his uh um niece was having trouble

749
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,000
with math and he started tutoring his

750
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
niece in math and he put like did it

751
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,799
over videos and so he put the videos

752
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,960
online, people started watching them. He

753
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,559
go, "Wow, what if every person could

754
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
have this little like personalized

755
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,080
tutor?" Um what if each person could

756
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,320
sort of study math at their own

757
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,240
individual pace? Um, and then he built

758
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,600
this whole enterprise and continues to,

759
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,600
you know, he he's incredibly

760
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,919
enthusiastic about AI right now because

761
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,400
like, oh man, instead of just having me

762
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,799
record um a tutor for each person, like

763
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,720
what if the GPT can like generate

764
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,159
personalized text related to each

765
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,640
individual person or something like

766
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,799
that. Um, and those ideas, you know,

767
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
they're it's it's not like they're just

768
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,320
dropped in the world. They're advocated

769
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,840
for. Um, did you all see the New York

770
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,720
Time was it New York Times or Washington

771
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,279
Post? Somebody wrote an op-ed about um

772
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
about Salon and AI. It was either in the

773
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,320
Washington Post or the New York Times,

774
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,480
but it was basically something like this

775
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,520
is the first AI that your kid will love

776
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,120
or something like that. And it's

777
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,480
basically just a sort of celebratory

778
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,159
piece of of Kot MIGO. Um good. So, so

779
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,720
that's an unusual group, you know, and

780
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,200
and those groups um they I mean today

781
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,640
they like, you know, like Saw Khan goes

782
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,919
on the Today Show and tells people what

783
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,200
he thinks. He goes to investor

784
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,640
conferences and tells people what he

785
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,240
thinks. He goes to schools, you know,

786
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,200
Harvard and MIT bringing him in every

787
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,840
couple years and things like that. So

788
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,279
these folks advocate for their ideas. Um

789
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,960
they're not, you know, the ideas the

790
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,159
ideas don't fall from the sky. There's a

791
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,360
stakeholder who is advancing those

792
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,400
ideas. Who are some who are some other

793
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,520
stakeholders that seem important? Um, I

794
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
thought it was weird that you could

795
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,360
think about like manufacturers and I

796
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,240
mean like like the people who produce

797
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,159
transistors which is like TSMC and ASML

798
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,760
because if a bunch of schools across

799
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,679
America all of a sudden need like

800
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,679
thousands and thousands of iPads and you

801
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,520
have like this big backlog request on

802
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,760
like M2 chips or whatever is in them

803
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,880
right now and then someone like TSMC the

804
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,039
only people who really produce

805
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,400
transistors has this huge float and they

806
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,080
make a lot of money. Yeah. Yeah. that

807
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,760
that that that people become, you know,

808
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,880
that those folks then organize

809
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,720
themselves into trade groups um and they

810
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,960
go to, you know, they they how do they

811
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,320
how do they advance their interests?

812
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,679
They do things like um give some of

813
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,279
their materials away for schools,

814
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,679
demonstration, they create training

815
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,919
programs for their materials and share

816
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
them. Um they have sales and marketing

817
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,000
people that go around and get people

818
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,159
advanced about that. Um they like

819
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,279
sponsor conferences. they, you know,

820
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,720
what maybe that they're not even

821
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,559
directly advertising for. They're

822
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,080
they're just, you know, their presence

823
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,360
to try to encourage teachers and other

824
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,600
sorts of groups to to be behind it. Um,

825
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,440
you know, uh, we spend an enormous

826
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,440
amount of money on education every year

827
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,799
in the United States and lot, you know,

828
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
the the biggest chunk of that money goes

829
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,000
to pay the salaries of the people who do

830
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,440
stuff and another big chunk of that

831
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,799
money goes to heating and air

832
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
conditioning, you know, for which there

833
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,559
are people who are selling those things.

834
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,480
Um but you know basically the third

835
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,000
biggest bucket after those two is the

836
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,240
stuff we buy in schools to help people

837
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,320
learn. Um and so um uh yeah there there

838
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,559
are advocates who are you know the folks

839
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,159
who are not neutral in these things. Um

840
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,919
there are ways you know Apple computer

841
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,360
has been particularly prominent over the

842
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,679
last bunch of years and trying to craft

843
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,240
a vision of itself as a company um that

844
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,919
has a particular role inside colleges,

845
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,240
universities, schools those kinds of

846
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,919
things.

847
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,919
I think something that surprised me, but

848
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,080
maybe it's not that surprising, was like

849
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,200
government government as a whole and

850
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,520
like eludism between governments because

851
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,520
uh in the class we took last semester

852
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,600
like in education. We talked a lot about

853
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,120
like Americanism and how like it's so

854
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,880
linked with education and I know it's

855
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,480
such a big thing to be like oh like this

856
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,559
country has like the biggest amount like

857
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,159
the highest SAT score on average or like

858
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,480
this many people academy or something

859
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,240
like that. So sometimes it really is

860
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,320
just like governments competing against

861
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
each other and trying to see like who's

862
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,279
the best of the best. Great. And in the

863
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,880
United States when we talk about

864
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,480
government actors, what are all the

865
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
different possible government actors we

866
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,799
might be thinking about?

867
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,159
Education. So there's a US Department of

868
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:34,320
Education. Who else is there?

869
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,399
So local boards of education. So there's

870
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,559
local boards of education. So a very un

871
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,159
unusual thing about the United States

872
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,679
Department of Education is it is or the

873
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,840
United States education system is it's

874
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,840
extremely decentralized. There are

875
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
130,000 schools and there are 13,000

876
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,200
school districts. The modal elected

877
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,279
official in the United States is a

878
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,799
schoolboard member. There are more if if

879
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,919
you are if you're an elected official in

880
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,440
the United States, the thing you are

881
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,360
most likely to be is a schoolboard

882
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,960
member. Um and you know um schoolboard

883
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,840
members are interesting stakeholders.

884
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,120
They are um well and they range from

885
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,799
community to communities. In lots of

886
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,080
communities, they're just like a

887
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,480
community member who's particularly

888
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,919
interested in education. Um but there

889
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,279
are also um people who are looking to um

890
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,880
you know, it's an entry point for people

891
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,480
who are interested in political careers.

892
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,240
Lots of people who you are schoolboard

893
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,039
members go to be on state reps and other

894
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,559
kinds of things like that. This is a

895
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:28,720
particularly um sort of fakened moment

896
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,039
for people who are politically who are

897
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,880
who are politically ambitious to pursue

898
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,440
those ambitious uh through the school

899
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,559
system. Um especially uh in the American

900
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,799
right um where where reform of schools

901
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,480
has become like a way to get kind of

902
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,520
attention within the political party and

903
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,039
things like that. Um, and uh, and yeah,

904
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,520
there's all there's all kinds of towns

905
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,799
across the country where, you know, and

906
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,159
I think you get some of this is like

907
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,360
some school board is like, you know,

908
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,039
what would be really great is film

909
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,480
strips. Like, let's go big on film

910
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,080
strips. Um, you know, what would be

911
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,760
really great is like closed circuit

912
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,360
television. Um, wouldn't that be a

913
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,960
useful thing to have? You know, and so

914
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,960
it's it's not even like it's not the

915
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,919
teachers, it's not the superintendent,

916
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,039
it's not the people who are sort of in

917
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,240
the schools, it's like some community

918
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,039
members who are like, "Let's do it."

919
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,640
um uh you know I in uh in the United

920
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,320
States today there probably two versions

921
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,480
of that is there are definitely school

922
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,320
boards whose identity is sort of shaped

923
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,760
around like being a cutting edge school

924
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,799
like in a bunch of the affluent suburban

925
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,399
towns around Boston you know like Wells

926
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,039
Lee Newton like they want to be thought

927
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,399
of as having like really great cutting

928
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,399
edge forward thinking schools you know

929
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,760
Newton spent $200 million or something

930
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,080
like that on the last high school that

931
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,519
they built um and so it can be you know

932
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,640
a way they become a schoolboard member

933
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,799
is like I'm going to help the school

934
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,159
system modernize and embrace technology

935
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
and things like that. There can also be

936
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,080
the opposite. There can also be people

937
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,519
who come in um the most common is like

938
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,159
people who work for the technology

939
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,559
industry who are like you have no idea

940
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,600
how much surveillance is built into this

941
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,960
technology. Um all the time when I talk

942
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,240
to you know principles or

943
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,679
superintendents who are being like we're

944
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,120
kind of having a hard time you know

945
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,399
helping parents understand why these

946
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,760
things would be useful. It's like

947
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,519
someone who works for Google or

948
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,279
Microsoft or something like that, you

949
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,200
know, who like who knows the

950
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,399
surveillance capacity of these tools and

951
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,120
is concerned about it. Um, yeah, I just

952
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,559
kind of like an anecdote that I used to

953
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,720
work in edtech and educational

954
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,559
publishing and I worked on mostly

955
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,120
products for the state of Florida and

956
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,360
like really showed how much power some

957
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,559
of these districts have like the because

958
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,480
the school board would make a decision

959
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,240
like every several times or one or two

960
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,919
districts in Florida would some say they

961
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,760
need something and that would change the

962
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,919
entire road map for a product that's

963
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,440
used nationally. So it's like you have a

964
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,120
couple people in Florida who are like we

965
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,279
really need this thing and suddenly it's

966
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,440
like kids in Arkansas are also are

967
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,679
learning differently. So I would this is

968
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,919
in this is definitely still true. It's

969
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,760
breaking down a little bit because of

970
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,679
the capacity for sort of a web

971
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,440
publishing and custom publication but

972
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,279
for a big chunk of what you might I

973
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,440
don't know the latter third of the 20th

974
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,039
century the first 10 years of the 21st

975
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,720
century um basic you know like somebody

976
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,360
publishers would publish a US history

977
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,080
book um how do they decide what to make

978
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,000
of a US history book um you say well

979
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,440
like what are the most important states

980
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,559
to sell this history book

981
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,240
in Florida is one of them what are the

982
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,960
other ones You can name them.

983
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,120
California,

984
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,039
Texas, New York, California, Texas, New

985
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,600
York, Florida. Um those are like four of

986
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,960
the most important states just by

987
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,480
population. Um so now you got to think

988
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,000
about like the the standards of th like

989
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,519
the his every state has standards. The

990
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,120
history standards of those four states

991
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,080
are more important than the history

992
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,279
standards of Maine and North Dakota. Um

993
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,720
and as like political things come up

994
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,840
around you know history is where this

995
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
happens pretty frequently but it happens

996
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,000
in math and reading and other things

997
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,679
too. Um yeah actually I I used to do

998
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,840
consulting for uh um uh history for

999
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,000
publishers of history textbooks and once

1000
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,039
I saw the sort of matrix where it was

1001
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,440
like it was like all the possible topics

1002
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,919
along the the columns and all of the

1003
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,679
states along the rows and like x's of

1004
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,040
like where all the topics get t you know

1005
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,359
the I mean the other thing is for like

1006
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,200
there'll be a huge you know group of

1007
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,440
Polish immigrants that come to some

1008
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,720
state and like they won't see Polish

1009
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,000
people represented in their textbooks

1010
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,520
and so they'll be like we're, you know,

1011
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,200
we're only going to adopt books that

1012
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,960
like talk about the importance of Polish

1013
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,919
Americans in the history. You the

1014
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,440
publishing companies are like, "All

1015
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,639
right, add the Polish and then, you

1016
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,919
know, but then the Italians do it and

1017
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,200
the Cambodian do everybody else do it

1018
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,919
and the textbooks get, you know, that's

1019
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,520
why when you picked up your 800 pound um

1020
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,839
history textbook, it was full of like

1021
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,119
all these like weird little um bits and

1022
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,040
pieces and things like that. So yeah,

1023
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,480
these these state level I mean here's

1024
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,720
another like tiny feature of this but

1025
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,520
ends up being important. Um there are

1026
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,480
some states mostly in the south where

1027
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,320
material adoptions happen centrally or

1028
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,879
have some kind of centralized function.

1029
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,040
Um so Texas, Florida, they have state

1030
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,880
level boards that say you can only adopt

1031
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,359
books that pass these boards.

1032
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,200
Massachusetts is a huge local control

1033
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,960
state. Um the school districts in

1034
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,320
Massachusetts will go bonkers if the

1035
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,680
state tried to tell them which textbooks

1036
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,040
they could or could not use. You know,

1037
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,839
there'd be like another revolution. you

1038
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,680
know, one if buy land, two if buy um you

1039
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,280
know, C-class Mercedes or whatever it

1040
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,359
is. Um and uh they they just wouldn't

1041
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,040
allow it. But it means that those states

1042
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,480
that have this sort of centralized

1043
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,240
function actually end up having more

1044
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,520
influence over the publishers because

1045
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,040
they say, "Look, you want to sell a book

1046
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,800
here?" You know, and now it's not just a

1047
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,079
book, now it's a web program or things

1048
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,839
like that. Now, the thing that sort of

1049
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,000
like is breaking away some of that

1050
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,640
monopoly, although also causing kind of

1051
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,480
problems is, you know, states can say

1052
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,079
like, okay, we want to, you know, we're

1053
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,920
going to pass all these laws that b that

1054
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,640
have the effect of like way ramping down

1055
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,839
the teaching of black history. Um, and

1056
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,520
you know, publishers can be like, all

1057
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,960
right, well, your web version of that

1058
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,640
will delete this and this and this and

1059
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
this, but you know, over in New York or

1060
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,599
California and liberal states, you can

1061
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,359
have all that kind of stuff in there.

1062
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,760
Yeah. Khil. Yeah. And kind of like uh uh

1063
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,320
going off of that like the political

1064
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,320
platforms play a like a large role in

1065
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,640
most of these places in the US that's

1066
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,520
very like very much there but as an

1067
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,839
example from my own country like there

1068
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,480
at every public school they have like a

1069
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,640
speaker system like at the start of the

1070
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,480
school specifically because they want to

1071
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,640
play the national anthem. That's

1072
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,880
something they did really early. The

1073
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,200
kids have to uh to do it and to like oh

1074
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,839
there's so much like technology that

1075
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,079
just one thing why is this the only

1076
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,480
piece of there is like some kind of

1077
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,680
incentive they want to build with like

1078
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,839
you know kind of political motive. And

1079
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,160
then does does the does that broadcast

1080
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,960
system be used at other parts of the day

1081
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,480
as well or this only gets used at the

1082
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,760
start of the school where the national

1083
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,000
anthem have like some like some kids uh

1084
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,720
every like classroom does like a session

1085
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,119
where they just like do like some

1086
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,720
religious stuff uh some like Arabic

1087
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,640
poems some like fun facts and then just

1088
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,400
that but that's mostly just I I love

1089
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,480
that. I think that's a fabulous example.

1090
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,560
So, so the the whatever the state

1091
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,400
government is like the state is in the

1092
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,800
nation the nation state government um

1093
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,440
says every school must broadcast the

1094
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,200
national anthem every day. Um every

1095
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,599
single school in the country then has to

1096
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
build a technology infrastructure that

1097
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,280
allows that to happen and then once that

1098
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,440
technology infrastructure is there it

1099
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,880
can be used in other kinds of ways as

1100
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,960
well or not used or other kinds of

1101
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,359
things like that. Um you can find

1102
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,720
national examples of this in other kinds

1103
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,800
of ways. You know, one of the most

1104
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
interesting countries right now um for

1105
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,359
education policy makers to watch is

1106
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,640
Estonia. Um about every decade, like

1107
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,720
some country that people aren't really

1108
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,480
paying attention to um gets really good

1109
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,240
international test scores. Um so

1110
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,520
Singapore was it for a while, Finland

1111
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,359
was it for a while, people are obsessed

1112
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,960
with Finland for a while, and Estonia is

1113
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,040
kind of last like who are you people and

1114
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,880
why like why are you so good at reading?

1115
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Um and uh Estonia is very famous for it

1116
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,400
sometimes it's called Estonia. um their

1117
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,640
government has really embraced the

1118
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,079
internet um in a very centralized kind

1119
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,440
of way. And so people are trying looking

1120
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
at and thinking about how education

1121
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,880
technologies are adopted in Estonia and

1122
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
other kinds of ways. But it but it

1123
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,760
wasn't a policy that was just for the

1124
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,079
schools. They were like we're going to

1125
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,920
put Estonia on the map by having really

1126
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,920
good digital government services. And

1127
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,440
that national policy decision ends up

1128
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,280
affecting the learning experiences of

1129
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,640
kids in schools in all kinds of places.

1130
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,040
Yeah, that's a great example.

1131
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,520
um students what are what are what are

1132
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,760
the interests and and and disincentives

1133
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,760
of students.

1134
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,720
It's cool. It's a new piece of

1135
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,880
technology. Okay. So, almost all of us

1136
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,280
like novelty. Um that is one of the

1137
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,320
advantages that technology has. One of

1138
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,960
the um uh although an amazing thing

1139
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,040
about novelty is how shockingly quickly

1140
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,880
it wears off. Um actually I was reading

1141
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,599
this on Reddit the other day. someone a

1142
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,839
teacher was being like like I don't like

1143
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,520
I brought a Nintendo Switch into class

1144
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,359
so we could play these mathematical

1145
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,359
logic games and my students were like oh

1146
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,000
please miss can we just do worksheets

1147
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,240
and I was like fine do worksheets then

1148
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,920
um but you know they're like oh man you

1149
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,440
want you play some online game I don't

1150
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,640
want to play you know now there would

1151
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,079
have been some moment that this class

1152
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,320
would be like what we could play a

1153
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,800
computer game in class this is amazing

1154
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,480
um but that is you know um it's a sort

1155
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,119
of it's a it's an interesting feature of

1156
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,880
education technology adoption that like

1157
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,400
novelty can be extremely compelling for

1158
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,200
a short period of time and then wear off

1159
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,800
pretty quickly. Do you have any comment

1160
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,119
on like why students default is now back

1161
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,720
to that pen and paper like the way like

1162
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,520
because I mean people are always like

1163
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,200
education has been the same for decades

1164
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,760
and why does it always look this way

1165
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,040
even after we've reformed it like why is

1166
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,640
the default that pen and paper? Good. So

1167
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,079
what well let's just highlight an

1168
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,599
important thing that you observed um

1169
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,839
which we we were talking about over here

1170
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,800
too which is just schools are incredibly

1171
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,040
conservative institutions. Um why why

1172
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,599
why would that cons small C conser not

1173
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,200
rightwing some of them are but um small

1174
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,880
C conservative they do things the same

1175
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,560
way over and over again. Um what are

1176
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,720
some possible reasons for that? One is

1177
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,560
if you went and interviewed parents and

1178
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,000
said who are another stakeholder that a

1179
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,760
bunch of people brought up um how much

1180
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,760
do you want us experimenting with your

1181
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,079
children? Um the answer to that is going

1182
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,599
to be pretty low. Like the enthusiasm

1183
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,880
that people have for experimenting on

1184
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,880
children is low. Um second um everyone

1185
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,240
in the educational system who's an adult

1186
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,720
has what's been sometimes called the

1187
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,160
apprenticeship of observation. Um you

1188
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,200
all have been in school somewhere

1189
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,800
between like 13 and 18 years. Um and

1190
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,839
that shapes your experience. And so

1191
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,680
people who have roughly the same

1192
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,920
education level as you go into schools

1193
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,160
and become teachers and they bring that

1194
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,240
13, 18, 20 years of educational

1195
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,839
experience with them. Um, and that

1196
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,160
shapes the way you think schools should

1197
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,920
unfold. Um, parents can bring those

1198
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,599
expectations in. I was I will never

1199
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,200
forget this. I was once working I was

1200
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,599
conversing with a school in Utah that

1201
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,440
was trying to switch to openly licensed

1202
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,560
materials. It was pretty I don't know 15

1203
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
years ago, 18 years ago or something

1204
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,920
like that. They were trying to get away

1205
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,839
from textbooks and to have people use

1206
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,760
digital materials, particularly digital

1207
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,280
materials that their teachers could edit

1208
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,400
um so that they could make them, you

1209
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,079
know, tailor to their students and

1210
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,000
things like that. And they said and they

1211
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,440
said, "But they still kept textbooks in

1212
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,400
classroom." And you know, I can't tell

1213
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,000
you whether or not that's true, but he

1214
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,680
says, "The reason why we keep textbooks

1215
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,359
in classrooms is if there aren't

1216
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,760
textbooks in classrooms, parents will be

1217
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,119
upset." Um that like parent like parents

1218
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,960
when they go into a classroom expect to

1219
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,599
see textbooks there. Basically, it was

1220
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,200
cheaper to keep buying enough textbooks

1221
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,040
to be in all of the classrooms than it

1222
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
was to like hire administrators to

1223
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,880
explain to parents why there weren't

1224
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,200
textbooks in the classroom anymore. Um

1225
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,079
so all of these different stakeholders

1226
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,119
um this sort of conservative vision of

1227
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,359
education is kind of part of that. Um

1228
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,440
one possibility is that that's really

1229
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,520
bad. Um that there actually like way

1230
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,359
better ways of doing things that are out

1231
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,960
there and it's a bummer that we're so

1232
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,079
conservative and that's really holding

1233
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,240
us back. Um, another possibility is that

1234
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,880
the practices that exist in schools have

1235
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,800
been refined over decades and centuries

1236
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,520
and they are the way they are because

1237
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,680
they're pretty darn good. Um, that they

1238
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,520
that that we keep doing certain kinds of

1239
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,359
things because they work. Um, so you'll

1240
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,200
have to figure out for yourself as you

1241
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,119
know if you hear examples of students

1242
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,040
kind of adopting old practices, are they

1243
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,400
adopting old practices because they work

1244
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,520
really well and because they like them,

1245
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,079
because they're comfortable and

1246
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,359
familiar? Um there's an argument that

1247
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,599
particularly in our age where students

1248
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,800
are sort of fixated on grades and

1249
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,720
performance in a way that they might

1250
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,319
have not been in decades past because

1251
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,599
you know not not because kids are like

1252
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,280
more materialistic or something. It's

1253
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,800
because of economic uncertainty. Um

1254
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,640
because as the gap between wealthy and

1255
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,240
poor people widens and the stakes of

1256
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,560
education become higher people become

1257
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,000
more fixated on it. Um and so those kids

1258
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,520
who are sort of adopting familiar

1259
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,119
matters like do they really like the

1260
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,720
familiarity or do they know how to do

1261
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,880
well in the familiarity and things like

1262
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,720
that. But again, like all the, you know,

1263
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,119
keep tying all the things we were

1264
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,119
talking about back to the decision of

1265
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,839
educators trying to implement new

1266
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,599
technologies.

1267
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,000
Um, everyone in your system is going to

1268
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,359
have some kind of conservative impulse

1269
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,720
all the way down to students. That

1270
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,040
conservative impulse might be balanced

1271
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,560
by the uh novelty effect that we're

1272
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,960
talking about, but it's in there. So if

1273
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,359
you want a new technology to really be

1274
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,839
adapted in some kind of meaningful way,

1275
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,400
one strategy you can have is to have it

1276
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,480
align with existing practices. You could

1277
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,599
say let's take technologies that do the

1278
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,040
kinds of things that are already

1279
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,720
happening in schools. Like that will be

1280
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,640
less upsetting. That'll require less

1281
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,040
training. That'll require less upset. It

1282
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,319
probably also won't help that much. Um I

1283
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,280
mean the people selling the technologies

1284
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,680
won't say that. But if you're just like

1285
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,280
digitizing existing practices, how how

1286
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,200
likely are you to have substantial gains

1287
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,480
from digitizing existing practices? Or

1288
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,000
maybe you're like a big ambitious

1289
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,440
reformer. You say, "No, no, no. We could

1290
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
be doing so much better. We could go

1291
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,760
from 2% to 100% efficiency in schools.

1292
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,760
We just have to make big changes in our

1293
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,000
practice." Well, making big changes in

1294
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,680
practice requires convincing people to

1295
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,920
change all of these things. Um there was

1296
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,440
a I you know, I've read this book a

1297
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,000
zillion times now, but I was just

1298
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,960
revisiting um a line in here that I

1299
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,839
loved. Um it was uh he says something

1300
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,800
towards the end that were like

1301
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:07,520
um settings have plans for their

1302
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,880
inhabitants. Anybody remember that? He

1303
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,680
was he was talking about the physical

1304
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,680
layout of a classroom but but he was

1305
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,200
using a broader sociological principle.

1306
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,920
Settings have plans for their

1307
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,720
inhabitants. Um people interact in a

1308
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,040
space in a certain way because the

1309
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,480
physical space is laid out and built in

1310
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,079
that way. So I was talking with these

1311
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,160
guys about one of the problems that film

1312
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,160
strips have. To have a film strip in

1313
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,160
your classroom, you have to take a giant

1314
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,920
projector on wheels and you have to roll

1315
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,720
it into the space. There would have been

1316
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,640
some classrooms, you know, filled with,

1317
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,160
you know, early 20th century, you know,

1318
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,839
urban schools with tons of immigrants

1319
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,920
who are pouring in on America's shores

1320
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,680
that don't have room in their classroom

1321
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,760
for a big thing. Um, the other thing

1322
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,920
that film strips had that was a huge

1323
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,599
pain is these giant film reels. You

1324
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,200
know, the early film reels were really,

1325
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,280
really big. Where are you going to put

1326
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,680
these things? You know, your town did

1327
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,839
not build a building um that that had

1328
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,400
like, you know, an archival film studio

1329
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,079
storage unit attached to it. Um let's

1330
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,079
say you have a big school and there are

1331
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,680
four first grade classes and you want to

1332
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,119
buy a film strip for all four of those

1333
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,960
first like are you going to build are

1334
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,560
you going to buy four copies of the same

1335
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,319
film strip? Like is each classroom going

1336
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,839
to have its own film library? If it has

1337
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,319
some centralized library, you have to

1338
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,240
have some way of like tagging,

1339
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,760
archiving, maintaining those things,

1340
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,280
bringing into classrooms. I mean, there

1341
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,040
are contemporary versions of all of

1342
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,200
these things. Um, oh, you want to give

1343
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,480
every kid a device? Um, how is that

1344
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,160
kid's device going to get on the

1345
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,839
network? How is they going to be able to

1346
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,359
log in? Who's going to deal when they

1347
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,040
lose their password? What's going to

1348
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,319
happen when their devices break? Are you

1349
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,400
going to make a Are you going to make

1350
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,920
families pay for the devices they break?

1351
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,040
Your kids are super poor. They can't

1352
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,359
afford that. So, you're going to

1353
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,440
contract with insurance company. who on

1354
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,640
your staff has experience contracting

1355
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,720
with insurance companies to ensure um uh

1356
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,160
you know uh uh computing devices like

1357
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,280
you didn't learn that at your I mean

1358
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,640
we'll talk with the education school

1359
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,640
deans on Wednesday but I'm pretty sure

1360
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,640
they're not teaching their um their

1361
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,000
their their students how to manage

1362
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,839
insurance contracts and things like

1363
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,400
that. Um all of those things become you

1364
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,000
know um if if well they you know they

1365
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,680
have a combination of incentives and

1366
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,720
disincentives that are associated with

1367
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,000
them. Um, good. Any any of these other

1368
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,359
people that it seems like is important

1369
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,240
for us to touch on before we um come to

1370
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,000
conclusion. We talked about parents. Um,

1371
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,520
you know, I I mean I don't know that how

1372
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,960
much we talked maybe here's one last

1373
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,319
thing that we could sort of talk about.

1374
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,079
We talked a little bit about school

1375
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:34,319
administrators. Um, but like a a thing

1376
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,319
to be particularly attentive to um in uh

1377
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,599
um in schools is just how many different

1378
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,280
kinds of adults with different roles

1379
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,599
there are. So, we talked about teachers.

1380
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,119
Um, there are people who are school

1381
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,200
principles. Like, if you're a school

1382
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,880
principal, what are what are the most

1383
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,200
urgent concerns that you have on any

1384
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,960
given day? Um, what what like what are

1385
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,200
what are the main incentives you have as

1386
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,400
a school principal? Your budget. Yep.

1387
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,520
You got to make sure you can pay for

1388
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,119
everything. A teacher's not worried

1389
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,240
about that. Teacher will buy as much,

1390
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,520
you know, if a school pay for it,

1391
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,800
they'll take as much technology as they

1392
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,160
want. you know, some of them, but

1393
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,000
principles have to balance a budget or

1394
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,920
or, you know, I mean, the weird thing is

1395
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,359
in the United States, it may not at all

1396
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,200
be a principal's role to balance a

1397
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,560
budget. It may be entirely a district

1398
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,000
role. So, there are some school

1399
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,680
districts where the district will make

1400
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,119
all the purchasing decisions. There are

1401
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,560
other districts where the districts will

1402
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,000
take big chunks of money, send it down

1403
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,440
to schools, and say, "Schools, make all

1404
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,040
the purchasing decisions."

1405
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,800
Um, what what else is super important

1406
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,000
for principles? I was going to say like

1407
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,079
just like maintaining the school

1408
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,839
building itself for like student safety.

1409
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,359
Yeah. Yep. student safety, maintaining

1410
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,640
the physical school building, making,

1411
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,520
you know, making sure things are running

1412
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,040
and operating and stuff like that. Are

1413
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,800
they also managing the relationships

1414
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,720
with like the district and also parents

1415
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,440
like all these outside? Yep. Yep. So,

1416
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,200
so, so, um, they and they are, you know,

1417
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,560
principles are sort of quintessential

1418
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,560
organizational behavior, middle

1419
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,160
managers. Um, they're like empowered to

1420
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,520
do some things but not others. They're

1421
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,960
accountable to lots of different kinds

1422
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,079
of stakeholders. There's all kind of

1423
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,560
complexity in what they're doing. Um uh

1424
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,319
a lot of them are pretty keyed evaluated

1425
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,920
based on test scores like especially in

1426
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,280
places where people are at where

1427
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,280
students are at risk of not passing

1428
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,880
tests. Um and depending upon the policy

1429
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,359
infrastructure test scores really matter

1430
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,599
to them. Um safety and the orderly

1431
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,440
operation of schools man like you know

1432
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,359
in in like every person in a building

1433
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,040
wants schools to be orderly but when

1434
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,400
schools are disorderly the person who

1435
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,680
has to deal with it the most is like an

1436
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,599
assistant principal or the principal.

1437
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,760
It's just more work for them. um you

1438
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,680
know you know um you like let all the

1439
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,040
kids have phones and you know fights

1440
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,559
break out and all kinds of things happen

1441
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,680
like it's the you know teachers have to

1442
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,400
deal with it but the principles really

1443
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,160
have to deal with it. I just like really

1444
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,839
short comment just when you asked us

1445
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,760
like what does a principal do? I've been

1446
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,440
around them my entire life and I was

1447
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,880
like I can only think of like two or

1448
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,559
three things that I know a principal

1449
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,480
actually does and I just think it's

1450
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,480
really strange that like most people

1451
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,400
aren't sitting you down being like this

1452
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,400
is the person you go to for x y and z

1453
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,720
things

1454
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
around these organizations good good so

1455
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,680
there there are I think there are a few

1456
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,000
things that you can grasp from that

1457
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,280
insight is first of all schools are just

1458
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,880
unbelievably complicated um I've spent

1459
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,040
the last 20 years basically doing

1460
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,079
nothing but thinking about schools and I

1461
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,440
still don't understand all the things

1462
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,520
that are going on in there. They are

1463
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,599
like if you want like just as an

1464
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,640
ecosystem, they're unbelievably complex

1465
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,880
and fascinating. Um the second is as you

1466
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,720
transition if you decide to work be

1467
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,640
involved in education, you sort you kind

1468
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,160
of have to like relearn all this stuff

1469
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,680
going from a student to being someone

1470
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,200
who's working in education. Like there's

1471
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,559
all kinds of things that were hidden

1472
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,920
from you, masked from you, or just sort

1473
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,000
of weren't important to you. You know,

1474
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,079
like the odds that any of you were like

1475
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,319
real troublemakers is pretty low given

1476
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,000
that you're at MIT. Um but you know

1477
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,920
there you know there's a classroom full

1478
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,359
of people sitting somewhere um that like

1479
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,480
knew principles pretty intimately

1480
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,400
because they spent a bunch of time in

1481
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,920
their office um because you know because

1482
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,839
of things that they did and so forth. So

1483
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,319
good. Yeah. If if if part of what

1484
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,839
happens to you in this class is uh a lot

1485
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,160
of times in social science we talk about

1486
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,200
making the familiar unfamiliar. Um a

1487
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,559
thing that you've looked at your whole

1488
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,839
life and being like whoa look at all

1489
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,119
these things there that I wasn't sort of

1490
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,400
paying attention to or you know wasn't

1491
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,559
made aware to me and those kinds of

1492
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:05,920
things. Um maybe here's here's one very

1493
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:08,720
concrete thing. Um uh let's think of

1494
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,359
something like uh um a student

1495
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,240
information system. Um or Canvas. Let's

1496
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,079
think of something like a learning

1497
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,559
management system. Who spends the most

1498
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,680
time using

1499
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:19,599
Canvas? Tell me about the people who use

1500
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,440
Canvas.

1501
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,200
Students. Students spend a lot of hours

1502
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,839
logged in looking at stuff on Canvas.

1503
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,559
Who else looks at Canvas? Teachers.

1504
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:35,119
Teachers. Who buys Canvas? this true not

1505
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:36,160
students and teachers in in in uh um in

1506
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,119
business school I think they would call

1507
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,119
this a third party payer problem. Um so

1508
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,079
if you are a company that's making a

1509
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,760
learning management

1510
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:49,640
system who's like of your

1511
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:52,599
stakeholders who has the most power to

1512
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,640
determine whether or not your thing gets

1513
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,319
purchased like some director of

1514
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,240
education technology or something like

1515
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,559
that some IT person. So, if you ever if

1516
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,760
you've ever wondered like why is this so

1517
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,440
terrible? Um, it wasn't built for you.

1518
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,680
Like in some in some important ways, it

1519
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,160
was literally not built for you. It was

1520
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,000
built to solve the problems of some

1521
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,599
middle level information technology

1522
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,359
manager. Who's going to buy one of those

1523
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,319
things? Um, so third-party payer

1524
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,680
problems are rife across. I mean, the

1525
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,880
problem with third-party payer problems

1526
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,920
from like a classical economics point of

1527
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,200
view is you just have misaligned

1528
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,040
incentives. um you know um in in some

1529
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,720
respects you could say that improving

1530
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,440
the teaching and learning experience on

1531
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:34,000
canvas is a cost um it's something that

1532
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,119
like reduces your pro profit obviously

1533
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,240
you have to make it good enough so that

1534
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,079
you know if like enough teachers and

1535
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,839
stuff are rolled I once anyone ever have

1536
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,760
to use blackboard

1537
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,760
okay good um I once met the I once met

1538
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,280
the guy who made blackboard and I was

1539
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,559
just standing there in line behind him

1540
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,000
or something like that being like what

1541
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,480
would it be like to have made a piece of

1542
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,920
software that millions of people hate

1543
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,599
like what like what would it have been

1544
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,680
like to like introduce so much

1545
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,160
unhappiness in the world with what

1546
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,440
you've built like and I it was it would

1547
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,640
have been rude I think in the buffet

1548
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,160
line to to to ask him to ask him that

1549
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,359
question. Um here's another thing that I

1550
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,880
want to say about who buys these things

1551
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,760
and this is really um important too

1552
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,000
especially to any of you who are

1553
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,359
interested in either an education like

1554
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,760
starting an education startup or other

1555
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:17,920
kinds of things. Um uh who in a school

1556
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,520
can buy technology? What are some

1557
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,520
possible titles of people who buy

1558
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,520
technology?

1559
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,599
We've mentioned a few. Librarians, a

1560
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,040
librarian could buy technology.

1561
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,440
Department chair. A department chair

1562
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,440
could buy technology.

1563
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,760
Teacher. A teacher. They're amongst the

1564
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,960
least likely. Actually, one of the

1565
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,800
sometimes people have made the argument

1566
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,240
that a that a problem in the education

1567
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,559
system is it's very it's very difficult

1568
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,880
to have a real sort of bottomup

1569
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,880
marketplace kind of effect. Um like

1570
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,520
teachers have in most places teachers

1571
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,040
have very few discretionary dollars um

1572
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,800
to the I mean that's why they're like

1573
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,800
holding big sales and asking like you

1574
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,240
know when you become parents like your

1575
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,440
teachers will ask you to bring in boxes

1576
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,720
of tissues and things like that and

1577
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,319
you'll be like what what broken failed

1578
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,079
country do we live in where you cannot

1579
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:10,240
simply buy all the tissues that you need

1580
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:12,319
for the children um or paper two reams

1581
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,160
two yeah two yeah two reams of paper a

1582
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,839
semester for all your students you know

1583
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,800
all right so the teachers don't have in

1584
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,760
some cases they do, but in a lot of

1585
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,280
cases you don't know what I mean.

1586
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,640
Principles can buy things, directors of

1587
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,839
instructional technology can buy things,

1588
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,440
assistant superintendents can buy

1589
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,800
things, superintendents can buy things,

1590
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,240
school boards in some places can

1591
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,359
directly authorize kinds of things,

1592
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,119
although that's probably more rare, but

1593
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:32,000
they can push for it. Um, but the point

1594
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,000
is across the 13,000 school districts

1595
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,440
and 130,000 schools in this country, the

1596
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,440
answer to the question, who can buy

1597
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,559
something is different in all of those

1598
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,040
contexts. Um, that makes starting an

1599
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,359
education technology company very very

1600
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,040
difficult.

1601
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:49,520
Um, when you go somewhere, you don't

1602
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,960
even know who can buy the thing. Um,

1603
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,040
like you don't even know who you're

1604
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,880
selling it to. Now, there are people who

1605
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,880
do know who buys all these things. The

1606
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,559
only people in the United States who

1607
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,400
know for every school in every district

1608
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,040
who has the power to buy stuff are giant

1609
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,400
publishers. Um, Pearson, Hotton,

1610
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,720
Mifflin, what was the company you work

1611
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,960
for? McGraill. McGraill. Perfect. They

1612
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,800
have an army of salespeople. this army

1613
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,440
of salespeople have fanned out across

1614
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,880
the 13,000 school districts and once a

1615
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,400
month, once a quarter, all the people

1616
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,920
who I just listed who can actually buy

1617
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,520
things, they take them out to lunch.

1618
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,960
They bring them free supplies. They do

1619
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,559
all that stuff. They, you know, like

1620
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,680
they probably don't have a master list

1621
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,880
somewhere. Instead, they have all these

1622
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,720
sales people who know the answers to

1623
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,319
these questions. Um, so if you're a

1624
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,000
Silicon Valley startup and you're like,

1625
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,440
"Oh, I know I've got this new like AI

1626
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,839
thing I'm building. It's super cool." Da

1627
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,000
da da. You don't have this massive

1628
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,559
network of sales connections to help you

1629
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,160
figure this out. Um, one my one of my

1630
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,440
favorite illustrations of this is at a

1631
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,839
bunch of education technology

1632
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,800
conferences. Um, how many of you ever

1633
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,640
have been to a conference where they

1634
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,240
have like you have you have a badge,

1635
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,680
right? And you can put stickers on your

1636
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,119
badges or other things like this.

1637
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,400
Basically, like one of the stickers you

1638
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,760
can put on your badge. You can put like

1639
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,240
your pronouns. You can put some other

1640
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,599
things like that. You can put um buyer.

1641
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,040
You can basically like signal to people

1642
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,960
like I actually have the power to

1643
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,400
purchase things. Um and then when you w

1644
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,720
you know um uh if you know when you walk

1645
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,160
through the exhibit hall they will pay

1646
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,359
more attention to the people who have

1647
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,440
the little buyer things on them than

1648
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,760
they will to like you know critical

1649
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,800
social science researcher badge um is

1650
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,800
put on your thing or something like

1651
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,760
that. So that is an incred so um here

1652
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,280
are some things that you should take

1653
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,119
away. These these systems are incredibly

1654
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,200
complicated. There are all kinds of

1655
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,280
stakeholders in them but they're they're

1656
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,440
not so infinite. they're not so complex

1657
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,359
that we can't like make a chart that

1658
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,040
sort of manages and starts to understand

1659
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,680
all these things. Um but as we move

1660
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,520
forward and as we um look at more sort

1661
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,599
of you know a thing that a thing that

1662
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,960
you can do in any kind of education

1663
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,240
technology problem any educational

1664
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,240
setting be like all right who are going

1665
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,680
to be the stakeholders for this problem

1666
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,920
this thing and what are going to be

1667
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,760
their interests. Um the more you know

1668
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,359
and not you know again not just like

1669
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,040
their official interest their official

1670
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,880
like state policy interest is to raise

1671
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,799
test scores or something like that. Um

1672
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,599
but one of my favorite examples um that

1673
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,960
we're talking about is uh televisions

1674
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,359
were more likely to be used at the end

1675
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,319
of the day because people were tired. Um

1676
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:06,400
like your body's circadian rhythm um

1677
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,880
indicates how technologies be used in

1678
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,280
classroom. And that is just as real is

1679
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,079
just as real as the policy mandate to

1680
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,079
raise test scores um or the school

1681
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:19,440
board's enthusiasm for technology or

1682
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,799
whatever it is. Um and so we we can in

1683
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,480
any kind of system we can figure out who

1684
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,920
are the stakeholders in the system. What

1685
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,599
are the interests of those things? What

1686
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,640
are the disinterests? A thing is more

1687
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,520
likely to work if it attends to those

1688
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,760
real meaningful felt interests and if it

1689
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,119
avoids those real meaningful felt

1690
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,440
disinterests. And of course we're doing

1691
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,119
this like in a very detailed way in

1692
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,040
education. But if you were to let leave

1693
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,960
education and you were to go into

1694
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,319
healthcare, if you were to go into legal

1695
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,480
technology, if you were going to retail,

1696
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:47,920
you can do the exact same exercise. um

1697
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,359
the technology that you're building for

1698
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,880
a hospital, like it has to work for a

1699
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,559
doctor, but it has to work for a nurse

1700
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,160
and an orderly and a patient and the

1701
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,839
patient's representative and the

1702
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,079
hospital's lawyers and all these

1703
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,520
different kinds of people. Um and so,

1704
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,760
you know, on the one hand, especially

1705
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,599
when people are designers of software,

1706
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,200
we can have this sense of like, oh, I'm

1707
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,880
building things for a user. I'm building

1708
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,920
things for like this individual user

1709
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,520
who's got their fingers on their

1710
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,040
keyboard or their thumb on the screen or

1711
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,240
something like that. Um, but I would

1712
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,319
encourage you as we're thinking through

1713
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,000
all these things to to think about these

1714
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:19,280
networks of interests and stakeholders

1715
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,040
much more broadly. Okay. Um, we'll talk

1716
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,240
to some education school deans on

1717
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,240
Wednesday. We'll learn a little bit

1718
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,520
about uh implementation, how you

1719
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,720
overcome some of these kinds of

1720
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,839
challenges from me. We'll hear a little

1721
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,079
bit about the National Education

1722
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:33,119
Technology Plan. Um, and I will pair you

1723
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,440
up with each other um to be able to do

1724
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,960
some peer editing of your essays and

1725
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,880
that will get us through the week. Sound

1726
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,319
good? Bueno, let me know if I can help

1727
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,040
you with anything. Otherwise, have a

1728
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,040
wonderful rest of your afternoon.
