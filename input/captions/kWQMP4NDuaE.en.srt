February 2022 Ian Miller sm9 boarded a

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,040
flight for Poland later he'd say he felt

12
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,640
motivated by ke's tragic ocean of

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,680
suffering and Ukrainian president zin's

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
please for help but he arrived with a

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,800
little notion of what to do as he'd

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,840
anticipated his hotel in xov turned out

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,320
to be a hub for Aid workers and

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,520
journalists Miller was on his laptop

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,600
using the lobby Wi-Fi to work remotely

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,640
as an MIT energy initiative Mighty

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,640
project manager when he overheard a

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,399
reporter interviewing a finish man about

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,879
his efforts to get Bulletproof bu and

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,680
helmets to the front lines Miller soon

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
found himself loading supplies onto

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,920
trains that had brought huge numbers of

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
refugees mostly women children and the

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,840
elderly to the station in xiu the trains

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,799
ran back at night their empty seats

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,040
filled with medical supplies generators

31
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,720
and baby food their lights dimmed to

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,400
reduce the chances of attack in April

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,560
2022 Miller and volunteers from a half

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,560
dozen countries planned and drove a

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,479
convoy of trucks packed with tourniquets

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
bandages and bulletproof vests across

37
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,960
the border

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,720
arriving at the site of the bcha

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,240
massacre soon after the Russians

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,040
retreated Miller peered into a mass

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,640
grave they were still Excavating it and

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,200
those weren't soldiers you know he says

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,960
I try to avoid looking at things like

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,759
that too often because it doesn't help

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,399
us save lives to be horrified all the

46
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,799
time he downplays any potential danger

47
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,399
to himself telling his family he's safer

48
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,000
where he is than in parts of the United

49
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,000
States soon after his first trip across

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,439
the border Miller convinced his former

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,439
MIT roommate Evan Platt 20 to come help

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,000
just for a week he told

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,119
Platt inspired by

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,520
energy Miller and Platt met in 2008 in

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,319
Washington DC where plat was interning

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,239
at the White House and Miller was about

57
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,800
to start his senior year at Georgetown

58
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,519
University Miller majored in government

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,400
but his interest in energy policy and

60
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,440
Technology grew during the years after

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,319
graduation he spent teaching science to

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
primary and secondary school students in

63
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,920
New York where he grown up in Boston and

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,959
in kalala Uganda some of the most fun

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,680
inspiring engaging lessons and modules I

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,680
did with the kids were focused on energy

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,480
he recalls while pursuing an MIT master

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,519
of science and chemical engineering from

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,840
2016 to 2018 he started researching

70
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,840
photo voltaics and wind power he held

71
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,640
leadership positions with the MIT energy

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,640
conference and the MIT Energy Club after

73
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,560
joining Mighty Miller worked on electric

74
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,000
vehicles EVS EV charging patterns and

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,920
other applications he became project

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,879
manager and research specialist for the

77
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,519
sustainable energy system analysis

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,360
modeling environment Sesame Which models

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,440
the levels of greenhouse gas emissions

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,799
from multiple energy sectors in future

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
scenarios Miller and Platt reconnected

82
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,599
and shared an apartment for 3 years

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
Platt studied systems design and

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,280
management through a joint MIT School of

Engineering and Sloan School of

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
Management program then stayed on to

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,360
work for the MIT technology licensing

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,159
office plat left MIT to pursue other

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,519
interests in 2020 the next time the two

90
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,280
would see each other would be in Poland

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,799
it's it's not easy living and working in

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
an active combat zone plat says there is

93
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,239
nobody on Earth I would rather be

Ukrainian government at the front line

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,359
aka the zero line with plat on board we

111
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,280
got more rigorous and quantitative in

112
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:22,440
terms of live save per dollar Miller

113
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,960
says $100 buys four tourniquet $1,000

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,880
attacks Russian Artillery shells are the

119
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,680
number one killer of ukrainians causing

120
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,400
around 80% of casualties he says

121
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,960

prevents deadly injuries from occurring

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,680
in the first place Miller's skills in

126
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,120
transportation and power system modeling

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,440

moving civilians away from the front

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
Ford pickups for transporting

133
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,639
anti-missile defense systems and

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,639
hundreds of batteries generators drones

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,400
bulletproof vests and helmets to the

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,520
front through nightmarish logistical

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,120
bottlenecks typically supplies from the

138
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,400
United States Asia and elsewhere in

139
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,240
Europe move through Gdansk and Warsaw

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,479
then proceed via train or vehicle to

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,880
warehouses in Lviv around 70 km east of

142
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:31,039
the Border next is the 7-hour trip to ke

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,080
or the 12-hour drive to nepro the

144
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,520
current Southern edge of the safe green

145
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,560
zone and the final 200 km to the front

146
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,800
here says Miller drivers with training

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,039
and protective gear often members of the

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,759
Ukrainian military take vehicles and

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,840
supplies to Frontline end users from day

150
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,680
one we asked our Ukrainian members and

151
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,960
partners for introductions and we're

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,840
constantly looking for more Miller says

153
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,759
when our vehicles reach the front lines

154
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,400
Evans team always does interviews about

155
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,400
needs and what's working what's not

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,600
what's saving the most lives

157
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,319
from my early days with Ian it's clear

158
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,319
he was always looking for ways to help

159
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,479
people connections were really important

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,840
to him says Mighty director Robert C

161
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,400
Armstrong when war broke out he found

162
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,599
the call to answer human need

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,440
irresistible I think many of us think of

164
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,319
doing that but we get bogged down in the

165
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,400
mechanics of everyday life he just

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,199
picked up and went Ian is just a

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,440
terrific person and a great role model

168
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,680
Armstrong

169
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,319
says accelerating

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,160
peace from the time Miller arrived in

171
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,520
late February through October 2022 he

172
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,560
continued working remotely for Mighty he

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,000
now works full-time as co-director of

174
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,840
zeroline for the foreseeable future

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,960
Miller will remain in Ukraine and Poland

176
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,319
he wants to see ukrainians follow in the

177
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,400
happy free prospering footsteps of other

178
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,759
ex Soviet States like the baltics he

179
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,880
says he'd like to see the supply chain

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,680
Innovations he and plat achieved applied

181
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,080
to humanitarian crisises elsewhere to

182
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,560
date zerol line has raised more than $5

183
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,280
million in donations and delivered

184
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,280
hundreds of tons of high impact Aid a

185
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,160
key part of our approach has always been

186
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,160
to support ukrainians who excel in

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,840
Saving Lives Miller says to that end the

189
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,000
programmers and military units to create

190
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,160
digital maps and processes to replace

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,039
paper maps and operations reminiscent of

192
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,560
World War II plot says modernizing the

193
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,160
intelligence infrastructure to

194
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,039
facilitate better military operations is

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,199
an important part of how a smaller

196
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,400
military can beat a larger more powerful

197
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,919
military the fact the fact that energy

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,400
underlies so many aspects of the war is

199
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,479
never far from Miller's mind Russia cut

200
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,960
off energy supplies to Europe then

201
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,440
targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure

on one hand he understands that billions

203
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,080
of people in developing countries such

204
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,319
as India need and deserve affordable

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,360
energy on the other hand he says oil and

206
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,879
gas purchases by those countries are

207
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,720
directly funding Russia's War Machine

208
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,840
everyone wants cheap Renewables and

209
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,720
we're getting there but it's taking time

210
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,759
lowering the costs of Renewables in

211
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,720
energy storage and supporting nent

212
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,879
commercial Fusion that's a very

213
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,639
important focus of Mighty in the long

214
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,560
run that'll help us reach a more

215
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,599
peaceful world without a doubt work at

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,879
Mighty and at zero line Miller says

217
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,879
truly could accelerate peace
