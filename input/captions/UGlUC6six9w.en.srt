1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,520
my name is Josh Santos and I'm the

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,520
co-founder and CEO of noya about 10

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,000
years ago I had the pleasure of uh of

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,519
paying my dues in the MIT chemical

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,519
engineering department I learned a lot

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,280
of fundamentals in heat and heat and

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,520
energy balances how to create flow

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,480
diagrams and uh how to properly deprive

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,640
yourself of sleep in order to get that

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,279
degree today I have the privilege of

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,560
supporting this team of about 30 people

12
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,080
that you see on the slide here to build

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,320
what we're thinking about as a gigaton

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,119
scale approach to direct air carbon

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,920
capture that's all electric interrupt

16
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,600
able and water positive now we've got an

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,600
incredible team of people that's got

18
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,440
skill sets ranging in all walks of

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,800
professional life everything from

20
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,600
engineering R&D commercial activity

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,399
project development You Name It We got

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,960
it and from institutions that are

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,079
leading in what they do places like

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,000
Tesla NG impact plenty pnnl and other

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,840
amazing research

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,399
organizations we're ultimately solving

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,640
what is the biggest challenge that

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,120
Humanity faces in climate change if you

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,800
boil down all types of climate

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,960
Technologies they sort of fall into one

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,960
of two key buckets bucket one is

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,840
technologies that are working on

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,720
preventing new emissions from entering

34
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,320
into the atmosphere that's this whole

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,000
gray chunk right here this is everything

36
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,479
like solar and wind which prevents us

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,360
needing to burn natural gas to create

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,680
electricity novel ways of making

39
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,840
chemicals in order to prevent new

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
emissions lots of fun stuff like that

41
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
there's a second bucket though that's

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,880
required and that's the removal of

43
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,640
historic emissions this purple chunk

44
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,600
here this is new we haven't really

45
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,360
needed to do this and it's pretty wild

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,840
to have to do it if you think about it

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,200
CO2 in the air is really dilute 420

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,000
parts per million for us to need to do

49
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,119
this is pretty crazy but for us to need

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,040
to do this on a billions of tons scale

51
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,200
is even crazier and the speed at which

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,600
we have to get there I think is the is

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,079
the is the part of this that really

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,399
boggles the Mind here we have to scale

55
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,640
this industry by about 50% year on-ear

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,600
for the next 25 years for us to meet

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,240
climate targets as the UN has put

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,200
forward that's a really big challenge

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,680
how do we do that well it's even harder

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
to think about when you couple on top of

61
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
that the fact that all of these new

62
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,920
emerging Technologies like artificial

63
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,200
intelligence are threatening to make

64
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,879
these goals difficult to reach whether

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,120
it's because of the fact that these

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,920
centers that are going to be performing

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,560
all of the data the data processing for

68
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,120
AI are incredibly carbon intensive or

69
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,840
whether the it's the fact that they also

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
require tons of water in order to

71
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,840
operate the cooling mechanisms that are

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,720
necessary coupling all of these things

73
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,800
on top of each other is a really wild

74
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,480
thing to have to think about

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
solving at Noya we're designing a an

76
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,680
approach to direct air capture that's

77
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
designed to meet this very moment that

78
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,200
we're in right now our approach to

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,480
direct air capture is all electric

80
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,959
meaning that it runs only uh using

81
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,879
electricity and it's and it can

82
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,720
integrate directly alongside existing

83
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,480
forms of renewable energy it's

84
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,440
interruptible meaning we can operate

85
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,560
intermittently like solar and wind does

86
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,879
and it's water positive we produce 5 to

87
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,720
seven cubic meters of water per ton of

88
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,200
CO2 and since our future commercial

89
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,120
projects are going to be a million tons

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,480
that's a l a lot of CO2 and a lot of

91
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,680
water that we'll be

92
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,360
producing now I'd like to talk about our

93
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,480
technology like it's a BRI filter but

94
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,840
for carbon negativity in that we clean

95
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,920
CO2 and water out of the air instead of

96
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,319
dirty gunk out of water it works by

97
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,239
moving excuse me it works by moving uh

98
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,120
moving air into contact with the

99
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
material that we've developed that

100
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,799
material is reactive with both CO2 and

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
water and it sits inside of a modular

102
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,159
piece of equipment that's like a solar

103
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,799
panel for carbon negativity in that we

104
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,159
can build the same exact design to

105
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,720
achieve whatever skill we need to we

106
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,680
input energy in the form of electricity

107
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,799
to release gaseous CO2 and water from

108
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,000
our material the water we give to folks

109
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,000
that want to use it for whatever they

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,080
need and the CO2 we inject underground

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,040
for permanent removal and

112
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
storage now we've been able to find some

113
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,080
incredible traction with the solution so

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,360
far we've got millions of dollars of

115
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,959
pre-orders for the carbon removal

116
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,280
credits that we'll be producing from

117
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,319
some of the organizations you can see on

118
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,799
the slide here Shopify is our biggest

119
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,360
customer we're excited to have their

120
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,159
support and uh and we're also excited to

121
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,280
announce today that we are partnering

122
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
with Johnson Matthew who we got

123
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,480
introduced to through the ILP actually

124
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,120
thank you for that introduction who's

125
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,840
going to be supporting us in scaling up

126
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,640
our carbon capture material to the

127
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,239
millions of tons scale per

128
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,959
year now we're looking for lots of folks

129
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,959
to talk to but really it boils down into

130
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,720
into a few key buckets if you're a

131
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,040
corporation that's looking to achieve

132
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,440
your climate targets and you want to

133
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,440
talk about how carbon removal can help

134
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,160
you do that come find me or my colleague

135
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,759
John who's sitting right here in the

136
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,720
middle if you're looking for ways to

137
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,160
Source water that is really hard to find

138
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,560
and you think that there's a way that we

139
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,039
might be able to help you with the pure

140
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,880
atmospherically generated water that we

141
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,440
produce said NOA would love to chat

142
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,320
about that again we got a lot and we

143
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
don't really have any use for it in our

144
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,880
own process so we're looking for

145
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,880
partners in that world and uh if you're

146
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,600
looking to to proliferate renewable

147
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,520
energy and want a flexible load to

148
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,960
deploy alongside your assets we'd love

149
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,080
to talk to you about that as well

150
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,440
ultimately the demand for clean

151
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,400
electrons in this country is going to

152
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,720
continue to up strip Supply and that's

153
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,720
something that we are very perfectly

154
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,800
poised to help solve it no of so again

155
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,320
we'll be at the booth over there in a

156
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,680
little bit come find me or my colleague

157
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,440
John John put your hand up so folks see

158
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,880
you there he is hey John come find us

159
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,260
later we'd love to talk to you thanks

160
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,959
everybody

161
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,959
[Applause]
