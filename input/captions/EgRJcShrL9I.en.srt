00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
Good morning. My name is Athanasius

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,759
Leios. I am a posttographer at the lab

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
of Bred Adrius at the University of

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,520
Toronto. H. Today I'm going to tell you

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,160
a few things about how we use signal

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,840
snaps images of live cells to study

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,439
dynamic cellular phenomena at a scale.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,199
So in the lab, we use single cell

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
phenomics. If you're not familiar with

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
the term phenomics, you can understand

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
it if you view it through the lens of

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,880
other omics approaches. For example, in

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
protoomics, our goal is to measure as

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
many proteins as possible. In a

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,440
biological specimen, in metabolomics, to

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,360
measure as many metabolites as possible,

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,320
in phenomics, our goal is to measure as

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,160
many phenotypes as possible. And because

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,079
almost any measurable trait can be

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,600
categorized as a phenotype, our

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,079
measurements can be diverse. We can

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,600
measure um proteins, we can measure

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,680
information about metabolites, about

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,079
subsol morphology and so on. And we do

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,079
that in single cells. So a typical

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
single cell phenomics pipeline entails

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
the use of high throughput genetics for

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,400
the construction of a large number of

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,159
cell lines or strains and then we

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,720
subject these strains to high throughput

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,960
live cell fluoresence microscopy where

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,799
we typically collect data from either

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,200
rates of 10 or hundreds of millions of

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,200
life cells and then we use computational

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,280
approaches to analyze this data and

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,240
extract systems level insights about the

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,600
function of ukarotic cells. So we are

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,000
very interested in understanding the

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
process of the cell division cycle which

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
very simply put is the process by which

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
a ukarotic cell gives birth to another

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,920
cell and also we're interested in

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
understanding how intracellular

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
organization emerges in ukarotic cells.

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
So you can understand intracellular

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,000
organization as the size and shape of

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
the different structures inside the cell

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
as well as the relative position to each

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,399
other. And it's important to mention

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
here that it cellular organization

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,640
emerges in a new cell during the process

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
of the cell division cycle. So these two

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
things that we study are related to each

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
other.

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,079
So why should we care about the cell

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,439
division cycle? Here you see a schematic

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,920
representation of the cell division

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,599
cycle of padding which is the main model

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
organism that we use in the lab to study

60
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,560
this process. Initially we start with a

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,720
single cell. As cell cycle progresses uh

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
the daughter cell emerges and starts

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
becomes larger and larger. At this part

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,120
of the cell cycle DNA replication is

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,440
taking place. Then we have the nuclear

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,760
division and eventually we end up having

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,640
two cells a mother and the new daughter

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,080
cell. And this process is essential for

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,319
the reproduction of unicellular

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,319
organisms for the growth and development

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,879
of multisellular ones as well as for

72
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,879
tissue repair and regeneration in them

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,640
and also the deregulation of the cell

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,160
cycle is the cause of some highly

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,920
prevalent and really devastating

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,599
diseases.

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,239
So I mentioned at the very beginning of

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,239
my talk that we use snapshot images of

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,480
life cells to study dynamic cellular

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,720
processes such as the cell cycle and by

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
snapshot I mean that we do not take time

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,160
series measurements and a typically

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,200
snapshot image would look something like

84
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,440
that where we have cells from a cell

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959
cycle asynchronous population which

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,599
means that cells are in different phase

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,000
of the cell cycle and then we apply some

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
computation to segment the cells and

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,159
then we apply further computation to

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,159
extract some temporal order uh from

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,720
these images to study cell cycle

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,159
specific uh phenomena. And the question

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,319
now would be why apply computation to

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,920
extract temporal information instead of

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
going directly doing time series

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,400
measurements and the simple answer is

97
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,560
that properly done time series uh life

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,959
fluoresence imaging experiments are very

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
difficult to perform at scale. So this

100
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,040
approach allows us to do our experiments

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,799
at a really really large scale and at

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,720
the same time we can avoid some common

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
pitfalls associated with time series

104
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,760
relation microscopy such as

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,239
phototoxicity and photo blitzing.

106
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,159
So you can imagine that um building a

107
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,239
new cell is quite a challenging task for

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,760
a cell. So this process entails the

109
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,920
production of the synthesis of a lot of

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,519
new protein and these new newly

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
synthesized proteins can be used for

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
example as building material for the new

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,720
cell and also for regulatory purposes

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
and these proteins not only to be

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
synthesized but also need to be

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,439
distributed at different parts of the

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,359
cell at the right time of the cell

118
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,919
cycle. So the process of the cell

119
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,440
division cycle uh entails quite a bit

120
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,919
involves quite a bit of what I like to

121
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,759
describe as cellular logistics which is

122
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,880
nothing else than changes in proton

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,880
abadance and localization and changes in

124
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,120
proto abadency of the cell cycle have

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,199
been previously mapped in detail but

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,600
until very recently um we we lacked

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,520
highly resolved protomy level view of

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
changes in protonression during the cell

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,600
cycle in any organism.

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,759
So in the next few slides I'm going to

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,440
tell you how we used our approach to

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
generate the first genome scale

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,960
annotation of protein localization

134
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,199
changes during the cell cycle of a cell.

135
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,280
So initially we started by constructing

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,360
a yeast strain that express some

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,360
fluorescent proteins and by these

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
fluorescent proteins if we we if we

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,039
would inspect these cells via

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,560
fluorescent microscopy this these

141
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
proteins would reveal the exact cell

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,199
cycle stage that the cell was when we

143
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
took the snapshot image and then we made

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
use of the so-called yeast GFP

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,000
collection. So this a collection of

146
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,080
approximately 4,000 yeast strains and in

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,160
each of these strains a different native

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,440
protein is fused to a green fluorescent

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
protein or a GFP and via this fusion

150
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,039
again if we inspect ourselves with

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,199
fluoresence microscopy we can measure

152
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,120
the abundance of the respective protein

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,520
a native protein but also identify its

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,680
localization in the cell and I have to

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,680
say that um this collections

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,680
approximately 4,000 yeast strains

157
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,160
captures approximately spans 75% um of

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
the yeast proto and nearly 100% of the

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,120
so-called visible yeast proto. So the

160
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
next step was to use systematic genetics

161
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,680
and specifically synthetic genetic array

162
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,000
technology to introduce this fluorescent

163
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
mark reporters in each of the strains in

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,039
the yeast GFP collection. And we ended

165
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,520
up constructing a new library of 4,000

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,360
yeast strains. And now in each of these

167
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,199
traits we could monitor both the

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,840
abadance and localization of a native

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,039
protein but also identify the exact cell

170
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,759
cycle stage that the cell was at. Then

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,680
we subjected um this library in high

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,080
throughput live cell fluoresence imaging

173
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,560
where we collected images from a bit

174
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,160
more than 20 million life cells. And I

175
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919
mentioned earlier that when we take a

176
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,400
snapshot cells are in different cell

177
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,639
cycle stages. So we had to somehow

178
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,319
automate the process of extracting cell

179
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,880
cycle specific information from these

180
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,360
images. And for that reason we developed

181
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,240
a supervised neural network that we call

182
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,160
cyclet. And what cyclet does it examines

183
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
a single cell image and based on the

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,240
fluorescent reports that we introduced

185
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,000
in our cells. It can tell the exact cell

186
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,720
cycle states um where a cell was when it

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,280
took that image. And we found out that

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,599
um cycling performed with more than 93%

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
accuracy. It allows us to do what we

190
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,520
term as incilico cell cycle

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,919
synchronization.

192
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,479
So once we have grouped ourselves at

193
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,199
different cell cycle stages using cycle

194
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,720
net uh we use the second convolutional

195
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
neuronet network that we applied in our

196
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,720
images that was previously developed in

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,000
the lab and it's called diplo and what

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,319
diplo does u it can identify the

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,120
subcellular location of a protein in a

200
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,440
cell with resolution of 20 distinct

201
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,759
subscellular localization classes. So

202
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,000
the essence here is that by applying two

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,319
distinct convolutional nar networks in

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,319
single snapshot images of life cells we

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,720
could extract specal information from

206
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,800
them at the scale and we found out that

207
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,960
our pipeline uh worked pretty well and

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,360
I'll show you here an example. So here

209
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
you see some cells. These are actually

210
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,360
cells from just taken with microscopy.

211
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,039
Blue denotes the cytoplas. Uh pink

212
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,879
denotes the nucleus and green the

213
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,879
proteinoperist. In this case the

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,960
protonist is vi which is a

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,639
transcriptional repressor. And we know

216
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,280
that at the beginning of the cell cycle

217
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
we five is localized at the nucleus. As

218
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
the cell cycle progresses, it exits the

219
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,039
nucleus and it goes to the cytoplasm and

220
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,639
it stays out of the nucleus until almost

221
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
the end of the cell cycle when it goes

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,879
back into the nucleus again. So these

223
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
are the real dynamics of W5 and in the

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,599
heat map you will see what our pipeline

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
predicted. So x-axis here denotes cell

226
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,840
cycle progression and the y-axis denotes

227
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
the different subcellular localization

228
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
classes and you can see that our

229
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,599
pipeline predicts that we is inside and

230
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,279
when the color is yellow it means that

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,120
the protein is in this localization

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,680
class. when it's dark, it's not in

233
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,039
there. So, our pipeline predicts that W5

234
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,800
is in the nucleus at the beginning of

235
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,320
the cell cycle. As cell cycle

236
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,480
progresses, it translocates to the

237
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,000
cytoplasm. It stays there until the end

238
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,240
of the cell cycle where it goes back

239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,200
again into the nucleus. So, which is

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,040
exactly what WI5 does in reality. And we

241
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
found out that our pipeline could also

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,920
accurately predict um uh other

243
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,519
well-known but way more complex cells

244
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,680
cycle specific changes in protein

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,519
localization. And by applying this

246
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,760
pipeline to the complete visible yeast

247
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,440
proton and also extracting protein

248
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,160
abundance measurements from the very

249
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,200
same cell images, we could generate a

250
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,080
highly resolved specal map of the proton

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,240
during the cell cycle. And because this

252
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,080
study has been um was recently

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,920
published, I will not focus more on the

254
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,519
insights that we generated. I would just

255
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,200
like to mention that all the data

256
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,040
generated in the study can be accessed

257
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,839
in a userfriendly way from the

258
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,839
cellvision.org/sellcycle org/sellcycle

259
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,000
which is a dedicated web tool that we

260
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,240
built for that purpose and the tool is

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
also directly searchable using human

262
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,120
names for colleagues that might not be

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,120
so familiar with yeast biology.

264
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,560
Now this study was supervised by Brad

265
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
Andrew and Charles Boon and was

266
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,160
performed collaboration with Ben Grace

267
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
and Doran Krauss and also other

268
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,200
colleagues at the University of Toronto,

269
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,040
Harvard, Alen University and University

270
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,120
of Minnesota.

271
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,680
And now I would like to take uh the last

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,959
few minutes of my talk to discuss how

273
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,839
can we take this further. So how can we

274
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,240
use now potentially snapshot images of

275
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
live cells to reconstruct the dynamics

276
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,399
of subcellular structures as a function

277
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,839
of the cell division cycle. I mentioned

278
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,880
at the beginning of the talk that we're

279
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
interested in understanding how

280
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
intracellular organization emergency

281
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
during the cell cycle. So how

282
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
dracellular organization changes as a

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,360
function of the cell cycle. And to map

284
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,440
that ideally we would like to have some

285
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,760
videos like that. So here you can see a

286
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,160
video of a yeast cell in red you see the

287
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,160
cytoplasm bright red you see the

288
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,000
nucleus. This cell goes to the cell

289
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,680
division cycle. We see that the daughter

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,079
cell emerges. I hope you can see that

291
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,240
well enough. The cell the nucleus

292
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,560
positioned up properly and then we have

293
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,519
nuclear division and the cell division

294
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,360
cycle ends and it starts all over. And

295
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,880
the nucleus is just one structure. We

296
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
want to see more structures. Ideally

297
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,360
would we would have more structures on

298
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,959
top of them. So here you see with green

299
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,720
on the top another structure we see

300
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
acting patches and specifically a

301
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,160
protein that's called sak six. What this

302
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,079
protein does is it stabilizes um and

303
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
orchestrates the acting cytokeleton to

304
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,720
support the morphogenesis of the

305
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,800
daughter cell and its expansion. Uh so

306
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,320
while such videos would be very useful

307
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,720
if we would have them for all structures

308
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,120
in the cell to map the dynamics of adel

309
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,839
organization. There is a secret about

310
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,079
them and the secret is that they are not

311
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,880
real or to be more precise they are

312
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,640
semi-real. They are based on what we

313
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,720
would describe possibly as biologically

314
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,200
informed virtual cells and I will tell

315
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,200
you how we build them. Again we start

316
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,680
with high throughput live cell flores

317
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,000
microscopy. We collect a pool of tens of

318
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,240
millions of live cells. And then we use

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,839
our neural network cycle net to group

320
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,640
these cells in different cell cycle

321
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,040
stages. And then we start for each video

322
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,200
by randomly selecting a cell from the

323
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,440
first cell cycle stage. And then we use

324
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,560
a score based on three image similarity

325
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,079
metrics to select the next uh real cell

326
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,720
in the pool from the next cell cycle

327
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,680
stage. And we do that iteratively until

328
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,600
we end up having uh selected images for

329
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,320
each of the cell cycle positions. each

330
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,399
of the cell cycle stages and we and then

331
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,839
we use a pre-trained deep learning model

332
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,120
film to add motion uh in between these

333
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,120
frames. So essentially by generating a

334
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
backbone of real cell images at

335
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,560
different cell cycle stages and using

336
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,320
generative AI we can construct

337
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,800
videos of ye cells going through the

338
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,279
cell division cycle which can also to

339
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,560
our surprise remarkably um uh

340
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,360
recapitulate uh dynamics of subscellular

341
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,639
structures uh with high I will say

342
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,200
biological um accuracy.

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,880
So we are now at the stage that we can

344
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,360
generate such videos for the complete

345
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,600
visible yeast proto. So for 4,000

346
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,839
different proteins and essentially uh

347
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,480
that spans all major structures in the

348
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,040
cell. And although we can see that the

349
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,720
videos um what the videos show bridge

350
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,079
very well with known biology, we're

351
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
still looking for some ways to

352
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,000
systematically evaluate their accuracy.

353
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,000
And um you can imagine that if we have

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
such videos of for every possible

355
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,279
structure in the cell, integrating all

356
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,160
this information would allow us to um

357
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,079
build a highdetailed map of the

358
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,480
biogenesis of a cell during the cell

359
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,600
cycle. And now we're actually looking

360
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,200
for ways to do that. So this project is

361
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,680
a project that we lead together with

362
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,360
professor Krishnan at the CS department

363
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,839
of the University of Toronto the vector

364
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,720
institute for for AI in collaboration

365
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,200
with graduate student and also with

366
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
contributions from Sophisan who will be

367
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,040
presenting a poster here tomorrow and

368
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,790
with that I would like to thank you I'll

369
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:49,830
be happy to take any questions.

370
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,830
[Applause]

371
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,199
Thank you. It's a fabulous talk. Um, so

372
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,920
last year, uh, Mattisman published a

373
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,560
high resolution protein interaction

374
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,360
protein protein interaction in yeast. So

375
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,680
have you classified your uh proteins to

376
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,440
see whether some of the proteins are

377
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,320
always collocicalized throughout the

378
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,360
cell cycle, some of them only uh

379
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,199
collocicalize for a fraction of time.

380
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
Yeah, awesome question because this will

381
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,040
allow us to identify transit

382
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,880
interactions during the cell cycle. We

383
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,199
are now one of the things that we're

384
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,279
doing is uh while we um we're analyzing

385
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,360
these videos, we're trying to integrate

386
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,440
more data sets into the analysis. one of

387
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,240
these data sets is the data set data set

388
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,399
you described with the protein protein

389
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,760
interactions in yeast and see what we

390
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,639
can learn from that I don't have an

391
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,320
answer of what we're going to learn yet

392
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,639
but it's possible that we'll be able to

393
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,399
identify you know some trans cell cycle

394
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,399
specific interactions through this

395
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,399
process

396
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,519
so Jean Philippe mentioned you know

397
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,199
interest in perturbations um have you

398
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,360
started looking at perturbations and the

399
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,839
effect on localization That's an awesome

400
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,560
question because we have generated a

401
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,040
data set in the lab that that consists

402
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,760
of a bit more than 100 millions of cells

403
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,199
and in this data set what we have done

404
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,959
uh we have uh surveyed approximately 17

405
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,839
distinct subscellular structures and we

406
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,160
had applied genome scale betterations in

407
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,760
there. So they are working on this on a

408
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,519
separate project but the idea is

409
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,519
eventually to merge these things. Yeah.

410
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,030
Right, let's thank the speaker again.

411
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,030
[Applause]
