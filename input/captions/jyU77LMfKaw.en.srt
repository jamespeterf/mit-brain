1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,480
inside of the incandescent light bulb

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,600
there's a filament and they've used

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
tungsten because tungsten has the

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,040
highest melting point of all the metals

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,000
inside of that light bulb there is an

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,759
inert atmosphere there's argon and

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,359
nitrogen gases to protect that filament

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,840
so take one of these filaments outside

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,199
of the light bulb and I'm going to turn

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,199
on the

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,720
electricity in the oxygen atmosphere the

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
electrons are flowing through there and

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,880
the tungsten atoms are boiling off with

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
the electrons I want to do one more

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,079
experiment we're going to take one of

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,480
these filaments and we're going to stick

17
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,559
it down into the liquid

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,920
nitrogen there it is in the liquid

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,640
nitrogen take it out

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,640
Amanda so even the liquid nitrogen is

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,000
surrounding that that filament and

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,680
protecting it and uh you've got the

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
situation where you don't have the

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,960
oxidation that's going on for more MIT

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,640
