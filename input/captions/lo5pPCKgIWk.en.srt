1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
So, there's a lot of builtin support to

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,400
really make these engagements impactful.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,160
It's not just we're going to match you,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,120
you're going to travel for a week, and

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,160
then you're done. Um there's a entire

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,279
ecosystem to make this successful. And I

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,880
think um that's why our projects have

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,880
the lasting impact that they do.

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,279
Welcome everyone to Thursdays with

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,960
Terrell. I will have Becca introduce

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,200
herself, talk about how long she's been

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120
at Sloan and what she's most excited

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
about in her role.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,280
>> Thanks Terrell. Hi everyone. Thank you

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,160
for having me today. Um I've been at

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Sloan for about 13 years and I started

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160
admissions. So really excited that

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,000
Terrell asked me to speak today. Uh my

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,960
name is Becca Souza and I'm the director

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,879
of action learning here at MIT Sloan. So

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,879
for those of you who are not as familiar

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,199
with action learning, basically this is

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,600
a type of teaching that is well known at

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,600
MIT Sloan where students are taking

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
courses, they're being evaluated by

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,240
faculty members, but as part of those

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,479
courses, they're working with real life

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
host companies to solve real world

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,840
problems. And this is built into the

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,000
curriculum. This is not an internship um

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,439
but it's an aspect to really take what

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,759
you're learning and go and do. Um, so

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,920
what makes me excited for this role, um,

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,080
is one, I think we're always trying to

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,640
be cutting edge, so always having the

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,119
most updated courses that students

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
really want to learn from. And then

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,200
within the last year, I think we've

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,159
really taken more of an approach to

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,159
ensure that the companies that we have

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
as part of action learning are the

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
companies that students really want to

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
work for when they graduate or they're

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
in regions where students once they

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,960
graduate, they want to go to that part

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,920
of the country or part of the world. So,

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,759
we're trying to really align with um

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
student expectations and student

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,079
outcomes as part of action learning. Um,

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
so that's something that has been on my

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,600
mind within the last couple years and

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
really excites me.

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
>> Awesome. Thank you for sharing, Becca.

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,879
So, I do have a quick slide just kind of

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,840
as an overview of the experiential

56
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,520
learning aspect of MIT Sloan. Like Becca

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
touched on, action learning is a part of

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
our um curriculum and a way for you to

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,599
kind of get some hands-on experience.

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,920
Um, there's over 20 plus action learning

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,200
labs. We'll probably dive into um those

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
individual ones that you may have

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
questions about. um and they happen at

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
multiple points during the academic year

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
whether it's during the independent

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
activities period or during our Sloan

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,879
intensive period. So there's multiple

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,560
touch points for students to engage in

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,640
the action learning that we do have to

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,560
offer here. Um I do have my first

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,879
question for Becca um in terms of our

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,879
conversation today is could you kind of

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
kind of walk us through like what is

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,000
action learning and why is it important

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
to the Sloan um school's mission um that

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
we have here?

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,360
>> Great. Um so it's a really a simple

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,440
question. Um our motto is think act

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,720
reflect. So MIT also has a motto men's

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,319
monis mind in hand and MIT Sloan action

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,680
learning is a teaching method where

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,440
students take what they learn in the

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,319
classroom and they're able to apply it

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
to a real business challenge. So as I

85
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,680
mentioned before these are different

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,440
from internships. They're credit bearing

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,519
courses. So, you are registering for

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,080
these during the school year and you're

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,480
taking them just like any other class.

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,120
Typically, they're done in small groups,

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,799
anywhere from three to six students. So,

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,720
you're doing them with your classmates.

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,080
It's a great networking opportunity

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
because you're able to take these

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,080
classes with students from your

96
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,080
individual program, other programs at

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,319
MIT Sloan across MIT's campus. Um, and

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
then it's also an opportunity to learn

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,560
about leadership. um whether that's

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,200
leading within your team, leading with

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,000
the host company, um there's great ways

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,920
to practice that. And most importantly

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
is at the end of the term, you're

104
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,400
actually giving a result to a company.

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,879
So you're presenting um to the hosts

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
about um your recommendations with the

107
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,120
goal that they're going to implement

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,720
them immediately. And many students stay

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,959
in touch with their host companies to

110
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,480
see how that implementation process

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,440
goes. So really that's the definition of

112
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,720
action learning. Um we do have some

113
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,560
goals that we really want students to

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,120
come out of when they're taking action

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,440
learning. So as I mentioned, one is we

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,240
want you to apply classroom theories and

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,320
frameworks to real business challenges.

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,759
Um so take everything you've learned

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,000
throughout um the actual lab course, but

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,880
also throughout the curriculum at MIT

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Sloan. We also want you to be able to

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,840
put some structure to problems. Um so uh

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,400
we have a faculty member Nelson Repening

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,720
and he always talks about a chief

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,280
marketing officer is not handed a

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
problem that just pertains to marketing.

127
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,520
It's going to impact the entire

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,400
business. And we want you to be able to

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,320
put structured to some unstructured

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,880
problems. And this is what happens in

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,039
action learning. um the scope of the

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
problem changes throughout the term and

133
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,240
students need to adapt. They need to

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,880
think on their feet. They need to

135
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,479
reflect and change course and so you're

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,120
able to really figure out um good um

137
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,639
project management skills. We want you

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,720
to be able to collaborate effectively in

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,680
teams as I mentioned have some open um

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,199
discourse. You're with a diverse team so

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
you need to be able to provide feedback

142
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
one to one another. You need to learn to

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
lead. And then lastly, action learning

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,800
is a great opportunity for reflection.

145
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Uh many students take our courses

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
because they know they want to go into

147
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,639
that industry. So for example, the

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,880
professor who teaches healthcare lab,

149
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,800
she always recommends students who want

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,440
to stay in healthcare and who've had a

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,440
healthcare experience take her course.

152
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240
Students who've never done healthcare

153
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,639
but you may want to take her course

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,320
because it's a great reflection point on

155
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
is this something that really interests

156
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,960
me? Is this something I see myself doing

157
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
in a future career? Um, how does this

158
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,600
fit into my career goals? You're able to

159
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,400
ask yourself a lot of questions um

160
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,319
during the action learning process.

161
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
>> Thank you for that answer, Becca. And I

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,800
do have a follow-up question as it

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,400
pertains to the companies that you

164
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,000
mentioned. Um, there may be some

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,639
questions here about like how do we get

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,880
companies on board and, you know, how do

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,639
we get them to engage with the Sloan

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,240
community before the action learning lab

169
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,720
even begins?

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,880
>> Great question. So typically how we get

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,600
um different companies involved in

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,240
Action Learning, one through our alumni.

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
That's our number one um resource.

174
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
students take action learning, they love

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,120
the experience, and then when they go um

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,360
into their career, they're like, one, I

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,840
want to give back to MIT Sloan, but also

178
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,880
this is such a unique um opportunity for

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,680
me to showcase my network and my MIT

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,360
Sloan strength with my company and get

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,160
some of these projects happening

182
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,039
immediately once they start. So, alumni

183
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,479
is our number one. We're also very happy

184
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,400
to say our second um source of projects

185
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,840
and companies through action learning is

186
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,880
repeat companies. So that's a twofold.

187
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,639
One companies do one project in

188
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
operations lab and then next year they

189
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
want to do it again because they loved

190
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,240
the work. They loved the results but

191
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,880
we're even seeing even more a company

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,880
does a project in operations lab but

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,120
then they say wait a minute we also want

194
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,440
to do a project in Gen AI lab. We also

195
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,680
want to do a project in enterprise

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,240
management lab. So we're able to share

197
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,400
companies across the portfolio again

198
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
because these companies are really

199
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,680
seeing the impact that MIT Sloan

200
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,440
students can deliver on. Um so those are

201
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,240
two and then third is mainly my team or

202
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,840
the faculty's outreach. So our faculty

203
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,759
have a big say in these companies

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,720
through their connections but they're

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,960
also looking at feedback from students.

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,560
A lot of the courses will survey the

207
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
students. What are the companies that

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,160
you're most interested in? What are the

209
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
countries you're most interested in? And

210
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,800
then they try to match based on that. My

211
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
team also does that. We use a lot of

212
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
different reports, mainly reports from

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,400
our career development office of where

214
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,039
are the companies that students are

215
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,639
landing jobs, where are the gaps, and

216
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,160
could we try to um you know focus in on

217
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
the companies that students are going to

218
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,280
work for or the companies that students

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,120
want to work for. um and to see those

220
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,399
numbers increase.

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
>> Awesome. Thank you for sharing that,

222
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,519
Becky. Rebecca, um I do have a question

223
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,039
that we pretty much get very frequently

224
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,080
when we're out recruiting students in

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,080
terms of how were student voices and

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
experiences integrated into the options

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,000
for action learning labs. So, if a

228
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,839
student has an idea about a potential

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
action learning lab, how can they go

230
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
about potentially launching that with

231
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,000
the action learning office?

232
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,480
>> Another great question. Um so I'll give

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,519
a story because I think this illustrates

234
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,600
how um pivotal student voice is at MIT

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,320
Sloan. So um in 2022 we had a course

236
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,839
Israel lab where students were taking a

237
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,640
um the lab and they were working with

238
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,399
Israeli startups typically tech startups

239
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,880
on new solutions. And then unfortunately

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,640
um some Middle East um fighting occurred

241
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,720
and we had a pivot. our students were

242
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,440
unable to travel to Israel that January

243
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,160
and so we pivoted and we connected with

244
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,880
a lot of alumni in Miami and they said

245
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,480
you should come and showcase Miami. A

246
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
lot of um South American work starts in

247
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,240
Miami when they want to expand to US but

248
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
we really have a large Israeli

249
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,000
contingency here and you can meet with a

250
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,800
lot of companies and talk about the

251
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,880
startup movement in Miami. So we did

252
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,920
just that. We pivoted and we took this

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,680
track and during it we met with some MIT

254
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,000
Sloan alumni who really managed large

255
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,040
real estate portfolios

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,680
and during that um the alumni and the

257
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,839
students were saying I would love to go

258
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,519
into real estate but during my time at

259
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,920
MIT Sloan there weren't many classes

260
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,600
focused on it. I feel like my resume is

261
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,160
not as well prepared when I'm trying to

262
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,920
apply for these projects. And so we

263
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,880
walked away from that saying why don't

264
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,760
we start a real estate lab. Um the next

265
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,440
year um we did so last year we um

266
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,320
introduced real estate lab into our

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,279
portfolio. Um again we wanted it to

268
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,720
really be unique and distinctive. So we

269
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,560
partnered with the center for real

270
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,360
estate on MIT's campus to offer this um

271
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,240
dual course that has MIT Sloan students

272
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,079
as well as um real estate students. So

273
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,880
they may have a focus in architecture,

274
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,440
they may have a focus in finance impact

275
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,320
impacting. And we really came together

276
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,560
to create this course so students could

277
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,399
have that hands-on experience when

278
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,120
they're going to apply for jobs for

279
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,240
internships and they can speak to their

280
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,560
real estate past. Um so that's a that's

281
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,800
a really highlevel example of how

282
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,519
students have made impact. But there's

283
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,839
also smaller examples. Uh my office, we

284
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,640
hold feedback sessions every term where

285
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,959
we ask students to come. This year I

286
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,519
actually asked my team instead of having

287
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,360
students sign up, can we reach out to

288
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,360
students who have not taken action

289
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
learning? And I want to find out why

290
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,120
have they not taken action learning? Has

291
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,440
it not been a priority for them? Are the

292
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,079
courses not fitting their needs? Do they

293
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,279
have any ideas? So once we hear this

294
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,160
feedback, we try to take action. Um, one

295
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,279
of our new deans priorities is really

296
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,200
interacting with the greater MIT and so

297
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,760
real estate lab is a great example of

298
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,600
that. Another great example um that

299
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,320
we've introduced within the last year is

300
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,880
engine lab. So um MIT has um something

301
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,640
called the engine. If you haven't worked

302
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,360
if you haven't looked into it, I highly

303
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,680
recommend just um you know googling

304
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,959
that. And what comes out of the engine

305
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,480
is tough tech startups. So Fiona Murray,

306
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,959
who's the dean of innovation at MIT

307
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,600
Sloan, she developed a course engine lab

308
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,279
where MIT Sloan students partner with

309
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,160
these tough tech startups that are

310
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,200
coming out of the engine at MIT. Um so

311
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,040
again trying to really integrate Sloan

312
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,399
with greater MIT resources and that also

313
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,079
came from the idea of um we wanted

314
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,760
something new and we want to make sure

315
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,560
this connects with what students want to

316
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,040
do upon graduation.

317
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
>> Awesome. You touched on the integration

318
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,440
aspect of action learning labs and I

319
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,600
know students may think this is a Sloan

320
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,360
exclusive kind of program but can you

321
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
talk about the crossover that we have

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,200
with the greater MIT and how students

323
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,720
can engage with different disciplines

324
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,519
here at MIT?

325
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,920
>> Yes. So action learning is such a great

326
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,160
resource if you want to integrate with

327
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,399
other programs within Sloan or other

328
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,480
departments within MIT. So I mentioned

329
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,639
real estate lab, our geni lab um that

330
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,839
began last year. They're hoping to

331
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,000
crosslist with course six at MIT Sloan.

332
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,959
So they have many undergrads taking that

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,360
course. Engine lab is a great example.

334
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,079
Our course entrepreneurship lab that

335
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,000
happens every fall and spring term

336
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,000
typically has over 10 different um

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
student bodies within it. So, they'll

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
have two-year MBAs, they'll have some

339
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,360
executive populations like our Sloan

340
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,519
fellows, they'll have students

341
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,320
cross-registered from Harvard, they'll

342
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,320
have mechanical engineering students.

343
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,399
Um, and once you're in these labs,

344
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,000
you're on a team and usually we try to

345
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,639
make the teams very diverse. So, um, you

346
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,839
kind of have this great mechanism that

347
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:54,000
introduces you to students outside of

348
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,920
your, um, individual network. Um so if

349
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,279
you know if I was a student I honestly

350
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,240
think action learning would probably be

351
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,839
a top priority if I really want to get

352
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,720
to know um students and um from other

353
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,880
parts of the institute and even beyond.

354
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,959
Uh entrepreneurship lab always has

355
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,360
students from Welssley. I mentioned

356
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,120
Harvard um many of our students from

357
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,720
Harvard Kennedy like to take action

358
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,720
learning because they want to see how

359
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,839
policy impacts some of these decision-

360
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,320
making. Um, so it's a great way really

361
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,920
to get to know um, different parts of

362
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,000
MIT.

363
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
>> Awesome. And I do have a question that

364
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,639
popped up in the chat that I was going

365
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,519
to ask next, so it's a great kind of

366
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,600
segue in terms of students in terms of

367
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,839
engaging with multiple action learning

368
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,560
labs. Is that's is that a possibility

369
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,399
for students to take part in?

370
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,639
>> Yes, we love when students take more

371
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,720
than one um, action learning course. So,

372
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,079
we typically say only one action

373
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,240
learning course per term. So um assuming

374
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,720
that ma mainly it's two-year MBAs on the

375
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,279
call you will have a core term in the

376
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,760
fall there is one action learning option

377
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,920
you can take your initial fall but then

378
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,440
after your core term you really are

379
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
starting to take a lot of different

380
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,519
electives and you have a lot of

381
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,440
different options and opportunity you

382
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,600
can take an action learning lab each

383
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,279
term there have been students who take

384
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,399
more than one each term but if there's

385
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,160
any travel associated with a lab you

386
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,880
can't just because the travel will

387
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,839
happen at the same time. Um, but we've

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,800
had many MBAs um, take up to three or

389
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,880
four labs and we love that because they

390
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
bring a different element. Again, all

391
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,720
those goals that I mentioned earlier,

392
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,480
they have already experienced that. So,

393
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,199
they can come in and say, "We really

394
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,279
need to focus on project management or

395
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,000
we need to really push back on our host

396
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,639
company. The scope is getting too large.

397
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
Let's um, really narrow it down." They

398
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,040
can offer some of that advice if they've

399
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
taken one before. Awesome.

400
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,480
And then I guess a follow-up question to

401
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,920
that in terms of students that are

402
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
coming from different programs as long

403
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,519
as we have some specialized masters, we

404
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
have the one-year MBA, we have the

405
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,440
two-year MBA, and then of course our

406
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,600
executive MBA. So what is the process

407
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,279
for enrolling um in an action learning

408
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,639
lab depending on which program you're in

409
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,720
because some of them may be here for a

410
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,120
shorter amount of time. So how do they

411
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,079
kind of navigate that process?

412
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,199
>> Great question. So, um, most of our

413
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,040
courses are on MIT's Sloan's bidding.

414
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,680
Um, and if you don't know bidding,

415
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,759
basically you will receive a,000 points

416
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,600
each term to bid for the courses that

417
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,880
you're most interested in. So, if

418
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,040
there's a course you really want to

419
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,800
take, you may decide, I want to bid all

420
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,440
my points or I may want to bid 500. Uh,

421
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,639
MIT provides you a lot of data and game

422
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,480
theory on how to do this. Um, I will say

423
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,399
most students do get into the courses

424
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,040
they want to. So don't um overthink that

425
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,440
process. But some of our courses also

426
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,759
have application because um the faculty

427
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,800
need to understand some of your um

428
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,480
unique skill sets. So for example um

429
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
product management we really want

430
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,600
students to have some form of experience

431
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,799
whether that's a class um a part past

432
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,280
role they've taken an internship in this

433
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,600
genai we need to understand what's your

434
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,679
coding ability what's your technical

435
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,959
ability. So some of our classes are

436
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,039
application and faculty will evaluate

437
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,959
and then some of our labs are

438
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,039
requirement for certain programs. So for

439
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,839
example, our masters in business

440
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,520
analytics needs to take analytics lab.

441
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,199
So you don't need to bid, you don't need

442
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,039
to apply, you're automatically going to

443
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,799
be enrolled in that. Our master of

444
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,640
finance has an action learning

445
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,559
requirement. So they have some options

446
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,520
that they can pick and choose from. Our

447
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,919
executive MBAs action learning is also a

448
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,000
requirement. So they automatically get

449
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,400
into the course the course options

450
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,480
there. So there's it the answer can

451
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,880
really vary per program per lab but most

452
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
the biggest message I want to get with I

453
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,039
want to um relay with this is don't

454
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,880
panic. Um a lot of our labs um have a

455
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,360
lot of seats because students are

456
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,360
interested and faculty are always

457
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,520
willing to work with students um to

458
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,760
figure out how to get you into classes.

459
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,160
So overall, it's not a stressful

460
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,960
situation. Um, we just want really

461
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,120
excited and engaged students.

462
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
>> Awesome. So I have one final question. I

463
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,000
know we're right at time. So I have one

464
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,679
final question before we transition to

465
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,840
the open Q&A. And there may be some uh I

466
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,039
guess concern or I guess addressing the

467
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,280
elephant in the room in terms of the

468
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,880
geopolitical landscape and how that may

469
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
be affecting some of our action learning

470
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,320
labs for some of our international

471
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
students. So, can you just kind of talk

472
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,679
about what we're doing um to be able to

473
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,760
accommodate students that still want to

474
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,520
have a travel aspect but may be a little

475
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
bit hesitant in terms of traveling to a

476
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,880
different location?

477
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
>> Great question. Um so, we want to make

478
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,760
sure that our offerings are equal to

479
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,080
all. So, a few things. One, we do have

480
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,240
international students in our fall

481
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,240
course, global entrepreneurship lab.

482
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,960
That is only international travel

483
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,400
typically to emerging uh countries. We

484
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,080
have 84 students enrolled in that and um

485
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,600
a good portion are international

486
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,600
students. We follow um we give any

487
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,440
recommendations from MIT's international

488
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,360
student office. So we're constantly

489
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,760
updating them, communicating with them,

490
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
giving them best practices. It's

491
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,919
ultimately up to the student to decide

492
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,039
if they want to travel. This year most

493
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,559
are willing to do that. However, if that

494
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,559
changes, we also have some

495
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,120
contingencies. Some of our labs have

496
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,200
US-based travel. So we have a course

497
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,960
called work lab that we're redesigning

498
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,360
for this year that's working with many

499
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,919
manufacturing companies that is only

500
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,240
within the United States. Real estate

501
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,799
lab will have international projects as

502
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,720
well as US-based projects. Operations

503
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,120
lab is mainly US-based projects. So, we

504
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,720
do have some flexibility that if travel

505
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,360
is something that you really want to do,

506
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
that is important to you, but you're an

507
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,799
international student and once you're

508
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,760
here, you don't want to take that risk,

509
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,919
we want to work with you. Um, and then

510
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,760
there's obviously some even further

511
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,840
contingencies where you sign up for an

512
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,760
international lab, but you're unable to

513
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,520
travel. You can still do some of that

514
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,559
work virtually. Sometimes even um for

515
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,960
example we've had a project um in Azon

516
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,880
lab that there was um Bostonbased

517
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,679
offices so students went and visited

518
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,320
there. So we want to make sure that if

519
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,960
this fits your learning objectives your

520
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,039
goals as a student but travel could

521
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,960
become in the way we want to make sure

522
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,200
you have options. And then the last

523
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,039
thing I will say is not all our labs

524
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,880
require travel. Um so we have um

525
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,200
healthcare labs. Sometimes you may visit

526
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,200
local Boston hospitals but no travel is

527
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,039
required. Uh we have enterprise

528
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,679
management lab no travel is required.

529
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,440
Genai no travel is required as of now.

530
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,320
PM usually no travel. So if you even if

531
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,480
you're like regardless of my status I

532
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,960
like Boston. I want to stay there. Um

533
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
there's still opportunities for you.

534
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
>> Awesome. Thank you for sharing that and

535
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,080
thank you for answering my moderated

536
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,480
questions. So we do have a lot of

537
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,559
questions in the Q&A. So I'll just those

538
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,039
now. Um I'll try to start in order and

539
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,039
I'll keep these anonymous so we can have

540
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,039
um some confidentiality in people's you

541
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,520
know questions. So the first question I

542
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,520
have here is in terms of the finance lab

543
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,880
or the proseminar in investment

544
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,960
management um do you have some projects

545
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,960
focused on fundamental equity research

546
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,919
as well?

547
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,000
>> So good question. Um a lot of our

548
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,760
projects are not necessarily

549
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,720
researchbased in the sense of like

550
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,000
you're just delivering a rapport. we're

551
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,600
solving problems. Um, so looking at this

552
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,760
question, I'm sure that we do have some

553
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,240
projects based on that problem, but

554
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,039
they're not research reportbased, if

555
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,440
that makes sense. Um, and just to give a

556
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,080
little bit clarification, we have our

557
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,080
um, finance lab. So that happens during

558
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,880
independent activities periods period in

559
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,960
January. And then we have two different

560
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,480
proseminars. Um, so those are one is in

561
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,320
the fall and one is in the spring. One

562
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,960
is focused on capital markets, one is

563
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,039
more focused on corporate finance. So

564
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,600
regardless of what your finance interest

565
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,320
is, we definitely can find a home for

566
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,799
you. Um, again based on student

567
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,640
feedback, we heard some feedback that

568
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,640
alternative investments is something

569
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
that students are really interested in.

570
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,559
So we've developed some alternative

571
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,080
investment projects within finance lab.

572
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,400
So if you have a specific idea in mind

573
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,039
whether if we can hopefully find that

574
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,440
within an existing lab or talk about

575
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,919
future but usually faculty are very good

576
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,280
at trying to find different products to

577
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,480
cater to um different student demands.

578
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,679
>> Awesome. And the next question I have

579
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,760
kind of has a two-way kind of um kind of

580
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,120
approach to it. Um, so for the

581
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,280
certificate programs that we offer at

582
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,799
MIT Sloan, um, so for someone that may

583
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,559
be specifically interested in one of

584
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,320
those, um, like the entrepreneurship

585
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,120
innovation certificate, would you

586
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,559
recommend taking multiple labs, um,

587
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,440
during their time here?

588
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,120
>> Yes. So the certificate, many of the

589
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
certificates um, coincide with the

590
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,280
action learning office and why that is

591
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,679
is because many of our certificates

592
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:22,240
require an action learning lab in order

593
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,799
to graduate. Um so for example um

594
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,640
product management uh certificate

595
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,600
requires that you take product

596
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,559
management lab. So yes if certificates

597
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,640
are of interest to you most likely you

598
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,240
will be taking a lab because it will be

599
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,320
a requirement. Even if the labs are not

600
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,280
a requirement for that certificate. A

601
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,640
lot of labs count as electives because

602
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,960
not only may the content be um

603
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,200
associated with the certificate, but the

604
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,799
actual project of the lab could be

605
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,039
associated and then it counts as an

606
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,960
elective. Um so action learning and

607
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:01,679
certificates do often go handinand.

608
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,799
>> Awesome. And the next question I have in

609
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,760
terms of potential restrictions. So are

610
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,240
there any kinds of companies or types of

611
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,120
companies like defense that would be

612
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,840
prohibited for foreign students um to

613
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,600
participate in action learning labs?

614
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,000
>> As of right now, no. Um however, when we

615
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,159
um find when we source our companies,

616
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,320
one of the questions we always ask them,

617
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,919
are there any conflicts of interest that

618
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,200
we need to be aware of students? So

619
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:35,200
whether you um have worked from for a

620
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,360
competitor or that maybe your our EMBAs

621
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,919
are currently employed so their company

622
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,720
may have an existing conflict. We will

623
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,320
then ask the students that. So um just

624
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,640
to get into a little bit more detail

625
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,799
once you're in a lab you will find out

626
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,880
all the projects and a lot of times

627
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,279
students have say in which projects they

628
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,360
rank their projects. During that

629
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,200
process, we will also say to you, are

630
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,440
there any companies that you feel like

631
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,679
you have a conflict of interest? Maybe

632
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,120
you have some financial tie to to

633
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,600
something or you've worked with a

634
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,440
competitor. And we make sure that it's

635
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,960
an equal match. So, if you say there's a

636
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,880
conflict, we won't match you. If they

637
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,799
say it's a conflict, we won't match you.

638
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,520
And we always have some contingency

639
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,919
plans for that. So, as of now, there's

640
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,919
no specific outliers of international

641
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,760
students can't work on certain projects.

642
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,679
However, I don't want to say an overall

643
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,600
no just because there could be a

644
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,000
conflict of interest based on each

645
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,000
individual student that could impact

646
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
project matching.

647
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,279
Awesome. Thank you for that

648
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,600
clarification. Um, and the next question

649
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
I have pertains to entrepreneurship lab,

650
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,440
which is actually one of our more

651
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,080
popular labs here. Um, do projects in

652
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,400
the entrepreneurship lab ever continue

653
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,600
beyond the semester? Um, for instance,

654
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
with our Martin Trust Center for

655
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,919
Entrepreneurship. Um so just trying to

656
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,279
figure out how do those particular

657
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,279
programs potentially lead to like

658
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,400
startup prototypes or seed funding those

659
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,440
type of things.

660
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,960
>> Great. So entrepreneurship lab is a

661
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,840
little bit different. You are not

662
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,799
working on your own idea. You're working

663
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,840
um on an existing startup's idea whether

664
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:11,520
that is to expand it to develop a new

665
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,919
product line um a new go to market

666
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,720
strategy a marketing strategy. So you're

667
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:21,120
not developing your own startup. There

668
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,000
are some courses um that are um hosted

669
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,200
by the Martin Trust Center like um I

670
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
think it's called entrepreneurial

671
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,240
ventures where you can really focus on

672
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,320
your own idea, your own prototype. Um

673
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,200
but to answer the question, do they ever

674
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,200
expand past terms? So from an action

675
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
learning standpoint, the answer is no.

676
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,440
We say once you give your final

677
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,480
deliverables the action learning

678
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,039
engagement is over. However, I can say

679
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,440
anecdotally from um speaking with many

680
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,279
students that is not always the case. Um

681
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,200
we have had examples where students get

682
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,000
hired from action learning companies,

683
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,440
they go to intern, they are asked to

684
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,480
consult um on future projects, they want

685
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,200
to volunteer and stay engaged. So there

686
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,840
are opportunities to stay involved but

687
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,840
specific to entrepreneurship lab um the

688
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,039
enga the engagement is done once you're

689
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,960
handing over your final deliverables.

690
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,679
>> Thank you for that. And I have another

691
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,080
question. This kind of talks about um I

692
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,240
guess student outcomes. So were there

693
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,240
any instances where students who took

694
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
the lab got professionally connected to

695
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,240
the host company and joined the company

696
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,880
after completing the program?

697
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,159
>> Yes. Um most recent we just posted on

698
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
LinkedIn. I think we have a couple

699
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,400
quotes if anyone wants to check out the

700
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,200
um MIT Sloan LinkedIn action learning

701
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,600
but um an EMBA student last year did a

702
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,919
project um with a company called

703
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,400
Manatech. Um they do a lot of different

704
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,440
things um a lot of innovation, a lot of

705
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,600
real estate and um he did the project he

706
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,279
was there in March for a week. He

707
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,000
wrapped it up in um end of April and

708
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,799
then the position of I believe it's

709
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,960
chief marketing officer became open.

710
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,720
They contacted him encouraging him to

711
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,760
apply and now he is there. Um so a great

712
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,600
story of one action learning engagement

713
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,640
really having an impact on career. Um we

714
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,880
have more of those stories anecdotally.

715
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,760
uh we don't do the best of like

716
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,919
quantifying it or showing impact um but

717
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,320
it definitely does happen in many

718
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,039
different ways and um not only full-time

719
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,080
offers but as I mentioned um internships

720
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,159
and even consulting opportunities.

721
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,399
>> Awesome. Few more questions in the chat

722
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,399
here. Um so we touched on the unique

723
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,240
aspect of the action learning labs here

724
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,799
at Sloan. Um but a lot of schools

725
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,000
nowadays have adopted a similar concept.

726
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,399
So, could we could you just kind of

727
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,159
touch on like what makes Sloan's action

728
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,360
learning labs different than some of our

729
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,240
peer schools?

730
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,320
>> Great question. So, um one thing that's

731
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,039
nice about working in higher ed is that

732
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,640
um a lot of times we meet with our with

733
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,320
different peer schools not as

734
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,120
competitors as really of sharing

735
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,960
knowledge across higher education. And

736
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,559
one thing that I always notice when I

737
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,200
meet with the different peers within

738
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,080
action learning is ours is set up much

739
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,399
more unique that ours is tied to an

740
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,039
actual academic course where students

741
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,360
are learning content. So for example

742
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,240
product management lab you are going to

743
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,000
be working and doing um work with a

744
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,840
company that's focused on that. However,

745
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,880
when you are taking class you're going

746
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,840
to learn about product management. A lot

747
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,799
of our peers it's quite different. Um,

748
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,399
so for example, Harvard does field where

749
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,039
all students get to work with a company,

750
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,360
but there's no associated class. You may

751
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,360
have a faculty mentor, but you don't

752
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,679
have a professor who's helping you

753
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,000
understand the concepts and the

754
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,960
frameworks needed to successfully

755
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,360
execute the project. Um, so I think ours

756
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:59,120
is much more academically linked and

757
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:02,159
tied to a bigger um, ecosystem of MIT. I

758
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,919
also think MIT within within MIT Sloan

759
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,880
we provide a lot of support to our

760
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,520
students. So many of our classes use a

761
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,520
faculty mentor. So when you take a class

762
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,120
you're going to have the actual faculty

763
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,960
teaching the course. They are going to

764
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,399
be a resource for you. Then you're going

765
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,600
to have the resource of a faculty

766
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,360
mentor. They're usually process experts.

767
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,360
They know these type of engagements.

768
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,919
They know how to make them successful.

769
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,600
But a lot of time times they're content

770
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,760
experts. they've worked in this

771
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,559
industry, they've worked in this region

772
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,679
and they can offer you advice on how to

773
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:39,039
um really meet the um demands of the

774
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,000
company. Then you have your team, then

775
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,799
you have the TA, then a lot of class

776
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,799
time is shared experiences. So as a

777
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,039
student, you can say we're running into

778
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,440
this concern. Has any other team done it

779
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,480
and how did you overcome this? Um, so

780
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,279
there's a lot of builtin support to

781
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,679
really make these engagements impactful.

782
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,440
It's not just we're going to match you,

783
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,320
you're going to travel for a week, and

784
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,440
then you're done. Um, there's a entire

785
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,559
ecosystem to make this successful. And I

786
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,600
think um that's why our projects have

787
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,520
the lasting impact that they do.

788
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,799
>> Awesome. So, seems like I'm kind of

789
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,840
bouncing around here, but I'm trying to

790
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,200
find the questions that are really

791
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,880
relevant to the conversation that we

792
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,960
touched on already. Um we touched on

793
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,799
this earlier in terms of um when the

794
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,279
labs are available. So for the formal

795
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,600
in-class semester, IEP and then it

796
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,000
intensive period. How do the action

797
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,679
learning labs differ across the

798
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
different periods of time that you may

799
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,720
be able to take them?

800
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,960
>> Yes. Okay. So at MIT Sloan, we have

801
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,519
three terms. We have a fall term, we

802
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,159
have IEP, and we have a spring term. So

803
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,960
some of our labs are specific to a term.

804
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:54,000
So you will take um I will give like

805
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,640
just specific examples of um analytics

806
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,519
lab is a fall course. It starts in

807
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,120
September, ends in December. So you are

808
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,799
um working with the company those

809
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,760
months. Then we have some courses that

810
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,840
overlap terms. So for example, global

811
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,480
entrepreneurship lab, that's one of our

812
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,880
flagship courses. It's taught by um

813
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,120
Nobel Prize winner Simon Johnson. That

814
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,679
is a fall course and then it extends

815
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,679
into AP. So the students are taking

816
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,120
class starting in September throughout

817
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,440
December. But then in January during IAP

818
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,600
they're going on site for 3 weeks to

819
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,600
their company typically to an emerging

820
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:38,399
market. Um so this year we have um

821
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:42,960
Kenya, Nigeria, Indonesia, Vietnam,

822
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:46,159
Spain, uh Chile, um we're real um

823
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,480
Kuwait, Dubai, we're really across the

824
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,080
globe. Um so that's an example of a

825
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,279
course that is spanning terms bu fall

826
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,519
and AP. Then some of our courses do the

827
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,399
opposite. They start in IP and then they

828
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,799
end in spring. Finance lab, you're

829
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,799
working with the company during IEP in

830
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,240
January, but then you're taking class

831
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,840
content in February and March. But then

832
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,799
we also have courses that are just

833
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,519
springterm. So our just springterm is

834
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,480
ASEON lab. You start in February, you

835
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,399
end in May. Um this last year we

836
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,960
introduced our first course that just

837
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,679
happens during AP. It's a one-week

838
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,559
course that works with nonprofits in the

839
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,559
local um Boston area and it's a mo it's

840
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,080
uh leading with impact. It's an

841
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,519
opportunity for students to really take

842
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,840
a multistakeholder model and apply it to

843
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,360
an organization in need. So a lot of

844
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,799
times students are like, you know,

845
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,880
probably in the future I'm not going to

846
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,039
want to work for a nonprofit. But what's

847
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,720
nice about leading with impact is you

848
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,159
have to take into account not only are

849
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,159
you working with a nonprofit, but most

850
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,399
likely you're working within the

851
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,799
government agency. A lot of times you're

852
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,399
working with university. A lot of times

853
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,880
funding comes from corporate. So it's

854
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,960
really that multistakeholder view. Um

855
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,760
and that's our first course that is just

856
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,079
one week specific in January. It doesn't

857
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:11,119
span any terms. Um so in short, it

858
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,960
really varies by lab. um when you are

859
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,679
here as a student, we give a lot of

860
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,200
presentations and we showcase visuals so

861
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,919
you can understand the layout. Um but we

862
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,320
make it we make it work based too on

863
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,839
what you need. So if you say to us, I

864
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,839
only can take a course in the spring,

865
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,480
we'll give you the offerings that just

866
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,599
um happen during that time.

867
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,679
>> Awesome. So I've identified three final

868
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,839
questions that'll get us to time but I

869
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,200
do apologize we don't get to all the

870
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,599
questions today but thank you all for

871
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,440
sharing. Um so they're very specific to

872
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,000
different um functionalities of action

873
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,399
learning labs. So the first ask is terms

874
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,359
of the funding aspect or financial

875
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,280
support for students that are

876
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,960
participating in action learning labs.

877
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,720
So can you just talk about that process

878
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,159
and how it works for students to gain

879
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,040
support financially for an action

880
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,640
learning lab?

881
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,079
>> Another great question. I apologize as I

882
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,720
should have brought that up on my own.

883
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,240
So uh forgive me. Amazing thing about

884
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,960
action learning it does not cost

885
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,200
students any additional. So the course I

886
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,760
mentioned global entrepreneurship lab or

887
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,240
known as Gab that has the most travel

888
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,440
that's 3 weeks. Most of our other travel

889
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,760
is one to two weeks. The host companies

890
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,640
pay for accommodations in airfare. So

891
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,320
students are not paying for that. Um we

892
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,040
really encourage the accommodations to

893
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,440
include breakfast have kitchens. So um

894
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,359
we don't pay for the food but typically

895
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,280
you know you are eating as a student

896
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,920
anyways um and we try to give you as

897
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,079
much resources for that. So any action

898
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,520
learning will not cost the student any

899
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,520
extra. The um school pays for any visa

900
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,760
fees that you may incur. Um we have a

901
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,000
lot of resources available. MIT

902
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,200
insurance. We have an emergency system

903
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,839
if anything happens on the ground and um

904
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,320
you need to um receive emergency

905
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,920
services. So, we help with that support.

906
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,760
Um so, the companies value what you're

907
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,839
bringing to the table and action

908
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,119
learning does not charge. So, we do not

909
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,200
charge the host companies to

910
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,359
participate. However, if they do

911
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,839
participate in a lab that requires

912
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,760
travel, the host companies pay for the

913
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,680
airfare and accommodations.

914
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,560
>> Awesome. Thank you for sharing that

915
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,240
response because I'm pretty sure that

916
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,960
was on the top of everybody's mind but

917
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,800
thank you to that person that that so

918
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,800
the next question I have is actually a

919
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,560
program specific question specifically

920
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,440
for those who were interested in a Sloan

921
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,520
Fellows MBA. Um is there any flexibility

922
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,480
at the start of the term to participate

923
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,560
in different labs before enrollment

924
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,240
during the full semester or is it only

925
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,839
during that 12 months that those

926
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,839
students are here?

927
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,240
>> Uh good question. Unfortunately, it is

928
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,160
only the 12 month months. MIT is very

929
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,720
strict until you're enrolled as a

930
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,640
student, we can't offer any of these

931
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,400
official um you know official offerings.

932
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,040
So, as a Sloan fellow, you take your

933
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,560
summer core um you there's no other

934
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,880
class, not many classes happening at

935
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,480
MIT, so you're really focused on core,

936
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,560
but then you're going to learn all about

937
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,119
bidding for the fall. So, we do have

938
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,320
Sloan Fellows students who take fall

939
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,560
labs as well as spring labs. So even

940
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,560
though it's that 12 months, um there's

941
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,440
really no missed opportunity. You still

942
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,800
have a full two terms to take action

943
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,520
learning.

944
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,359
>> Awesome. And then the next question I

945
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,720
have pertained to something you

946
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,240
mentioned earlier about business

947
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,280
analytics students and their requirement

948
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,520
of taking um the analytics lab. What's

949
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,200
the different focus between that action

950
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,520
learning lab and maybe their business

951
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,839
analytics capstone project?

952
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,400
>> Uh another great question. So a few

953
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,560
things. one analytics lab is not only

954
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,000
MBAN so you will get to have a network

955
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,119
of others and it's basically a shorter

956
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,839
engagement of your capstone so it it's a

957
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,000
good training exercise for capstone so

958
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,160
for those of you who are on the call and

959
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,800
um have never heard of the capstone that

960
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,720
is for uh our business analytic students

961
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,440
specifically it's a seven-month

962
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,760
engagement uh it begins in the spring

963
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,160
term and goes throughout the summer um

964
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,920
that is two students per company,

965
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,440
whereas our action learning is typically

966
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,160
a larger size, shorter engagement. Um,

967
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,520
and you, you know, less hours for the

968
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
action learning than the capstone

969
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,200
because the capstone is considered

970
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,520
full-time in the summer.

971
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,760
>> Awesome. I do have one bonus question

972
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,359
for you, but it's more light-hearted. In

973
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,480
terms of your experience working in

974
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,400
admissions, I definitely wanted to ask

975
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,320
this question. What advice would you

976
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,160
give to prospective students that are

977
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,440
navigating the application process,

978
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,079
regardless of which program they're

979
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,680
applying to?

980
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,440
Um, so one thing that I that I feel like

981
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,480
I really like about my background is as

982
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,880
Terrell mentioned, I started in

983
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,800
admissions. Then I actually worked more

984
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,520
closely with our EMBA and our Sloan

985
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,440
fellow students. I was um an adviser, so

986
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,320
I really helped them balance work, life,

987
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,800
school. And my biggest piece of advice

988
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,400
may not necessarily um help with like

989
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,240
the application um operations as I have

990
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,359
been a little bit removed. Well, one, be

991
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,119
authentic. Like, be yourself. Um, MIT

992
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,119
Sloan is a humble place. We love to get

993
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,400
to know everyone individually. So, be

994
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,560
authentic. Um, but my biggest piece of

995
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,040
advice when you're approaching

996
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,680
application process and just thinking

997
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,200
about the mindset of a student is MIT

998
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,599
Sloan has so much to offer. Um, and I

999
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,440
think our students who are really

1000
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,880
successful by the time they graduate,

1001
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,400
one thing they did throughout the

1002
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,720
process is like write down your goals.

1003
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,359
What are the outcomes you want um from

1004
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,680
getting whichever degree? Um, and those

1005
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,599
goals are going to change. The the point

1006
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,720
isn't for you to graduate and say, "Let

1007
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,040
me tick them all off." But just really

1008
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,119
reflecting on why you're here, what's

1009
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,960
the priority? Because by the time you're

1010
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,560
a student, everything is going to be

1011
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,240
thrown at you. and it it can become

1012
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,160
overwhelming. But if you have that those

1013
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,640
um specific things that you really want

1014
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,359
to get out, you're going to be more

1015
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,800
level-headed. You're going to um not be

1016
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,240
trying to do everything. You're going to

1017
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,320
be more um have more intent. And I

1018
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,920
really encourage students to take some

1019
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,920
time to reflect and um come in with some

1020
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,040
form of plan. That plan will change. And

1021
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,440
I I love when I see that. But a lot of

1022
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,359
the foundation of the plan is most

1023
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,440
important.

1024
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,359
>> Great advice cuz we actually say share

1025
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,359
the 8020 rule here. So being able to

1026
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,079
come in with 80% of what you want to do,

1027
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,520
but having that 20% to remain flexible

1028
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,599
um during your two years here or your

1029
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,200
one year here at Sloan. Um so great

1030
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,040
advice for our prospective students in

1031
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,440
the audience. Becca, I want to thank you

1032
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,200
again for being here and sharing some um

1033
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,960
insights into action learning because we

1034
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,800
do get a lot of questions on the road.

1035
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,000
um definitely happy to you know have a

1036
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,440
colleague like you that kind of share

1037
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,440
insight for our prospective students.

1038
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,520
This is a valuable experience for you

1039
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,560
all hopefully. Um, so Becca, thank you

1040
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,560
again and thank you all for
