1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,360
For our next speaker, we're going to uh

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,480
go to uh maybe even the most important

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,840
part of AI and that's the uh the person

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,279
in the loop. Uh I want to introduce

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,119
Demetrius Bertimus who is the vice

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,160
provost of MIT open learning and also a

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,240
professor at the MIT Sloan School of

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,800
Management. And Demetrius is going to

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,200
talk about training a billion people at

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,200
least to start. Let's hear it for

11
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,399
Demetrius. Good

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:52,199
afternoon. So I have this title training

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:56,960
one billion learners in AI. Not

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,760
a not a small title I don't think. So uh

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,680
let me give some initial remarks about

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,880
uh how rapidly computing has changed the

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,520
world in the last 70 years 75 years

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,320
starting with uh the first computers,

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,360
the microprocessor, the internet,

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,520
uh mobile technologies and so forth.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
Definitely in the last 40 years or so

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,200
this type of technologies has changed

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,159
our lives. on the other hand it might be

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,840
less known but AI has also been

25
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,680
developing somewhat in parallel uh m

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,520
many se several of these developments

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,000
have happened at MIT uh where you know

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,479
um many of our faculty have played a

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,240
very significant goal I have some of

30
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,479
some of the most uh some of the

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,040
significant developments one of which

32
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,560
has been the development of deep

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:58,560
learning so Um

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:01,360
the in my opinion AI is disrupting many

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,640
industries some of which you have heard

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,399
yesterday and today u more are coming in

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,599
my opinion

38
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,560
uh having been an educator all my life

39
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,239
uh I believe one of area one of the

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,879
areas that is ripe for change is

41
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,120
education and uh and this can be seen

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:26,480
I'll tell you more details in a minute

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,879
by AI's uh development since uh with

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,920
LLMs changing a lot of industries but

45
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,680
specifically in education the ability to

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,599
have personalized tutors, personalized

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,920
education, guidance systems, LLM

48
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,800
assessments and so forth.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:49,760
uh so I feel I am in a period of time

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,800
where uh the opportunities for uh

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,480
changing the world are substantially

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:01,120
uh substantially larger than in the

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:04,400
past. So uh what our objective is so I I

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,239
joined um uh I've been 40 years at MIT

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,080
but I've joined open learning uh since

56
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,879
September. So I have been seven months

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,879
in a job and I came with a vision of uh

58
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
of

59
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,680
affecting teaching AI to a billion

60
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,319
learners. I'll tell you first the

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,040
personal story. So I'm not new to open

62
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,959
learning. I in 2013 I uh developed one

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
uh one of the early MU books uh it's

64
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
called the analytics edge and over its

65
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,280
10-year history or so it has reached

66
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
about a million learners not a billion a

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,040
million and I have seen close and

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,720
personal the effect it has had on

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,000
individual learners I tell you two

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,879
stories one was I visited New Delhi and

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,879
I met a very young fellow who I've never

72
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,519
met him in my life 22 years old who

73
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,080
hugged me and thanked me for a class for

74
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,599
this class that enabled him and later

75
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,879
his family to himself to find a job in

76
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,040
the in the IT technology of India and

77
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,760
then uh brought his family out of the

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,879
slums. Another example similar in nature

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,519
some years ago. Uh I went to a

80
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,360
conference in Poland and there was an

81
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,560
Italian lady roughly 35 years old who

82
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,160
also hugged me. My wife was nearby and I

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,919
have to admit it was a a a moment uh

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
that I paused a little bit. She thanked

85
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,720
me again for a similar story. She was

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,400
she had a PhD from Milan. She had uh a

87
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
young family. She took the class and

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,680
found a job in the Lux in Luxembourg on

89
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
the on the industry. So clearly while of

90
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,960
course I do not know all the stories

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,880
this uh um these stories suggest the the

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,520
uh very significant effect that

93
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,479
education can have to the world. So of

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,680
course um so we have about a thousand

95
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:57,040
people here the class that uh I taught

96
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,880
taught brought about a million. So a

97
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,720
billion is not completely ridiculous

98
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,560
although I would say aspirationally

99
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,840
significant. So uh and why do I believe

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,440
this is realistic? Uh well I don't know

101
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,960
if you how many people here what know

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,800
what open learning

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,720
is? Do you know what open coursework

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,479
is? About the same number. So in the

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,240
last 25 years this in my opinion the the

106
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,759
story of open learning is a particularly

107
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,759
inspiring one. Um in the last 25 years

108
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,320
open learning uh have developed um

109
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,720
material that have it didn't reach a

110
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,960
billion but it basically it definitely

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,160
reached tens of millions if not hundreds

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,919
of millions of people um and uh in

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,360
particular it's not only the original

114
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,639
OCW which is 25 years old around 2012 we

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:57,280
had the massively online MS uh of which

116
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,600
we have about 300 uh 300 s classes that

117
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,360
uh we are open it we have opened it to

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,440
the world. We also have professional

119
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,280
education what is known as uh expro and

120
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,759
also uh horizons as well as the micro

121
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,520
masters which is a combination of ms in

122
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,199
a particular area. So we have some

123
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,840
experience on developing material uh

124
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:26,960
that are uh modular as well as give rise

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,840
to um to credentials that are stackable.

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,960
So uh in addition to this we also have

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,680
the the very big developments of AI as I

128
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,400
mentioned namely uh Gen AI in the last

129
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,759
two or three years after chat GBT or so

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:46,880
have uh enabled technologies that um in

131
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,240
my view were not available in the past

132
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,639
for example um the ability to do

133
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,639
personalized tutors. So if you want to

134
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,280
reach a billion people you don't there

135
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,400
are not enough TAs for that. So the only

136
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,039
way to do it is in an automated way and

137
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,840
uh we have developed in open learning

138
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,400
um tutors genai tutors that are able to

139
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,479
interact in a personalized way in in a

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,520
personalized way with with learners.

141
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,160
Another example is a guidance system. So

142
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,800
currently we have a new website in open

143
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,960
learning called learn.mmit.edu.

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,880
edu

145
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,759
learnmit.edu. Please check it. Uh and

146
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,160
you can enter and that has access to all

147
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,880
of open learning's uh uh um materials

148
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,080
and you can using this guidance system

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,800
you can ask I'm a I'm a engineer who is

150
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,960
interested in X in let's say learning AI

151
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,199
it will guide you appropriately giving

152
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
you appropriate resources that's a part

153
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,520
and you can have a dialogue that

154
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,400
personalizes the interaction. We also

155
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,479
have uh we are developing systems that

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,319
do assessments using genai. So uh in

157
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,680
particular in addition to these

158
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,680
technologies we also have uh the

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,720
aspiration of teaching what we call

160
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,000
universal AI. What is universal AI? So

161
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,680
universal AI has multiple components.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,680
The key module is uh

163
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,080
um four lectures like a module as

164
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,479
opposed to a le to a class which is 26

165
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,319
lectures. So this is designed into

166
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,240
smaller uh byes u perhaps four lectures

167
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,319
that are more easily updated in a field

168
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,120
that is exponentiating and diff and and

169
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,159
and uh and becoming very different from

170
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,560
from one year to the next. Uh so there

171
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,279
are foundational courses that

172
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:44,240
foundational modules that teach you the

173
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:48,640
the basics. They start with um with a

174
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:53,120
real world problem. They continue with

175
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,200
um real world data and we don't focus so

176
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,680
much on the mathematics of the machine

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,000
learning or the AI but rather on how

178
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,080
they are they are being used. We also

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,880
provide codes uh that people can use and

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,880
um in the end we teach people how to

181
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:14,560
what AI is and how to utilize it in a

182
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,080
way that improves their lives. Um either

183
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,120
retooling for new jobs uh learning to

184
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,600
enter scientific career or a law career

185
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,839
the advantages that AI is that's why

186
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,720
it's called universal it is able to

187
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,880
address every field in the world. So the

188
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,720
first part is a is a foundational

189
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,200
pieces. Uh we also as I told you we have

190
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,560
a tutor and then finally we have

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,760
vertical areas AI plus X for Olex AI in

192
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,920
the climate AI and medicine AI and

193
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,519
negotiations AI and entrepreneurship and

194
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,640
so forth. So the combination of

195
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:55,519
foundational tutors uh and more

196
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,279
deepening again in a module setting is

197
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
sort of what we call universal AI.

198
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,000
Universal in that the audience is

199
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,360
universal and the the fields that are

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,880
represented are also universal. Now

201
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,360
another remark that I have is that MIT

202
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,360
as an institution has about 11,000

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,720
students graduates and undergraduates.

204
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,640
So in other words, MIT has uh as as an

205
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,640
institution is uh has adapted to educate

206
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
some of the very smart people in the

207
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,680
world, especially younger ones. So

208
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,240
roughly 11,8 billion is about one in a

209
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,000
million people. However, if you are

210
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,160
going to reach a billion, you have to

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
think about new pedagogical approaches.

212
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,399
You cannot teach in the same way. um you

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,720
know a very mathematical development

214
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,040
would perhaps might be very much

215
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,000
appreciated by the MIT students might

216
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,120
not be as appreciated from the from the

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,920
bigger audience we aspire to reach.

218
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,959
So as I mentioned the delivery is um in

219
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,320
the direction the the quality is still

220
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,800
the same. However the delivery is more

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,959
one of

222
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,200
uh the underlying human stories that

223
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,440
motivate the problem motivate the

224
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,560
development is very much present.

225
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,800
Um so our our aspirination and our hope

226
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,600
that in indeed we will be successful in

227
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:27,200
reaching so many people is uh to be able

228
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,399
to connect in an accessible way and in a

229
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,480
somewhat authentic way where the the the

230
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,680
the human story is present and aspire of

231
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,560
course to to to help people in their

232
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,600
lives and their work.

233
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,000
As I mentioned before, uh in addition to

234
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
teaching AI, would like to leverage AI

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,399
and we have actually already developed

236
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:55,040
many things that are central to

237
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,720
the to the UI story. Of course, UI is

238
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,519
our first target. I'll say a few words

239
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,079
in in in a minute about our other

240
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,519
targets. As I mentioned, tutors. This is

241
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,920
something we have already developed. In

242
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,560
fact, we currently use it in one of the

243
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,279
classes I teach to to to see how it

244
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,519
interacts with real users and the the

245
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,040
evidence so far has been very positive.

246
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,160
We also uh geni can as I mentioned the

247
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,440
guidance system where in the learn MIT

248
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,160
edu site it gives you guidance how to

249
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,920
navigate within the website. It gives

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,040
you it also has the ability of real-time

251
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,680
feedback. So intelligent organizations

252
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,000
typically learn from the users and if

253
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,000
you aspire to have a lot of users you

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
you better listen to them what has

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,160
worked well or what has not worked well

256
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,480
even more important and what things are

257
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,760
missing. So we have developing a system

258
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,680
that takes feedback from from the world

259
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,560
summarizes and genai is particularly

260
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,720
good at that and then presents it in a

261
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,760
way that can help decision making at the

262
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,000
level of open learning. Another another

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,240
part is is what I call holistic

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,519
assessments. One of the most significant

265
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:11,399
issues in uh online education is how to

266
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:14,880
assess exams so that it is uh it it has

267
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,440
integrity. Um so we have developed a

268
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,320
system we are developing a system where

269
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,240
we take feedback from all parts. the

270
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,480
time people have spent, the homework as

271
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
how well they did in various exercises,

272
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
the way we interact with users, the way

273
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
they interact with the tutors and create

274
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,760
a system for holistically assessing. And

275
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,600
finally down the road we have we are uh

276
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,120
um working on

277
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,440
online translations in different

278
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,680
languages because I think Genai allows

279
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,920
to basically give the same lecture in

280
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,880
their mother language across the world

281
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,639
and mobile technologies. So not only we

282
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,040
try to to teach AI, we would like to

283
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,040
leverage AI to to improve the

284
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,560
educational offerings. So um what I

285
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,120
think also is particularly exciting um

286
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,440
that has always been in my mind for many

287
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,560
years I've been uh an MIT professor not

288
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,880
not in um not in open learning is the is

289
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,680
the promise that online education can

290
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,519
have

291
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,079
on personal education personalized

292
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,320
education. So personalized education

293
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,839
what I'm doing to I'm trying to educate

294
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,240
on our on the future cannot be

295
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,720
personalized. I'm not addressing

296
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,360
individuals. I'm I'm giving a broadle

297
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,000
lecture but but uh but with online

298
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,880
education and especially with Gen AI we

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,519
are experimenting with ways to

300
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,560
personalize the examples the pedagogy

301
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,399
the the exercises to the individual and

302
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,880
and I think the genai allows you to do

303
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,839
things in a cutting edging way of course

304
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,680
our effort is through universal AI in

305
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,839
the beginning but we have also lined up

306
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,120
many other areas but we are launching in

307
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,760
September biology ology uh we have we'll

308
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,920
have a new program in climate in energy

309
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,279
healthcare manufacturing and we hope the

310
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,000
humanities as well. So um so the other

311
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,160
in other in other words our initial

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,279
effort is with AI using AI in future

313
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,760
efforts not to in the distant future we

314
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,800
plan to work in other areas of important

315
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,800
society like climate, energy,

316
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:29,600
healthcare, manufacturing and humanities

317
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,360
to um to hopefully um reach uh more

318
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,079
people.

319
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,399
So um so that's sort of the punchline of

320
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,279
the talk but I would like first of all

321
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,600
to thank you and also tell you that uh

322
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,240
we have a booth here if you are excited

323
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,360
about this vision you would like to

324
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,079
participate through your institutions

325
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,600
personally and so forth talk to us and

326
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,920
uh and to be able to reach u so many

327
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,720
people clearly it requires a movement

328
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,490
it's not MIT you know we need a movement

329
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,840
of many people on that note I thank

330
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,840
[Applause]

331
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,000
So I only see one vote on this

332
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,519
one. So what is the most exciting what

333
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,240
is most exciting for students and

334
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,519
learners in the area of AI and

335
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,399
technologies. Well that's why I would

336
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,680
like to develop uh summarization so that

337
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,759
uh this is just my opinion. Uh I expect

338
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,199
that learning AI and its power through

339
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:35,360
uh real world examples through uh real

340
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:38,320
world data uh and discussion on uh in in

341
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
with real world environments. I think

342
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,600
it's exciting. Is it the most exciting?

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,839
I do not know but I definitely believe

344
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,839
it's

345
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,360
exciting. All right. Thank you.
