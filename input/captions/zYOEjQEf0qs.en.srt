00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome to this evening's broad

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,160
discovery series event. My name is Tom

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,680
Olrich. I'm the associate director for

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,040
science communications here at the Broad

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,440
and I'm thrilled to have you all joining

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,120
here in the room and also folks watching

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,080
online.

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,920
If you're not familiar with it, um the

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,600
Broad Discovery series explores the

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
genetic and biological roots of human

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,480
health and disease, the mechanisms that

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,680
govern how our cells and our bodies

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,760
function, new technologies that are

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,119
changing what's possible in science, and

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
the progress that's being made to

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,079
translate new discoveries into

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
treatments for both common and rare

18
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,320
diseases. For this evening's event,

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,160
we've partnered with our friends at the

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
Broad Ignite program, which if you're

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,800
not familiar with it, champions the

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,719
early career researchers at Broad with

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Bold who have bro bold innovative

24
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,640
ideas and Carpenter who is an institute

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
scientist, senior director of the

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,440
Broad's imaging platform, a past

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,760
Broadign Ignite awardee, and the current

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,199
Broad Ignite co-chair will tell you a

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,559
little bit more about the program.

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,840
She'll also introduce tonight's

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,280
speakers, Raldon Name and Shere Wang,

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,799
who are two of the program's talented

33
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,400
awardees. If you have any questions for

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
our speakers tonight, I encourage you to

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,880
flag down one of our micr runners during

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,159
the Q&A portion of the evening. And if

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
you're watching on YouTube, I'll be

work do my best to try to work them into

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
this evening's discussion.

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,400
If you're a Brody or a scientist with a

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
deep scientific question, um I'm going

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
to ask you to please hold your questions

45
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,439
until the reception so that members of

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600
the community get a chance to have their

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,880
questions

48
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,720
answered. And speaking of the reception,

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,560
if you're in the room, I invite you all

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,320
to join us in the Broad Discovery Center

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
right out here in the lobby after the

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,320
talks are over uh to join us for some

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
late

54
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,079
refreshments. And with that and over to

55
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,079

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,240
Thanks, Tom.

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,000
Hi everyone and thank you um to the

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,119
folks online also who are with us today.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,719
I am uh want to welcome you and to

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,640
specifically describe a bit about the

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,080
broad Ignite program which funded the

62
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
two awardees who are going to be

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,560
speaking tonight about their important

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,800
work in brain cell communication. Broad

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
Ignite launched about 10 years ago. It's

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
a philanthropic program that supports um

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,319
innovative early career research. So

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,080
really going for the uh the folks that

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,680
are early on in their career, haven't

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
had a chance to really make their mark

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
or um try their own innovative ideas. We

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,720
really want to give them the footing to

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
be able to to try something a bit risky

74
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,000
and a bit new. Um and that really pay

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,879
that that uh investment really pays off.

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,280
We have funded 76 projects over the past

77
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,760
decade with the program and we've seen

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,800
many of the awardees who are graduate

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,280
students, postocs, early career go on to

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
become leaders in their fields uh across

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
the globe and that's really such a

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
delight to see our impact on global

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,560
science through this um program of of of

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,200
awards here at the Broad. Um, in

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,200
addition to the ca the grant funding

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,560
that goes to each awardee to support the

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,840
research that they're most excited

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,400
about, each awardee has uh a a kind of

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,120
customized program of career support to

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,319
help them learn how to speak um to

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,480
audiences better um and to convey the

92
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,000
excitement of the research that they do

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
as well as mentoring and that kind of

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,319
thing. So, introduction to myself. I'm

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,840
an carpenter. I am an an awardee in 2018

96
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,159
through the broad Ignite program and

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,879
then um became the co-chair together

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
with Robi Badata and Bronwin McKinnus.

99
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,239
Um and I'm also a donor to the Broad

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Institute because I I believe so

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,560
strongly in what we're doing here and as

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
you'll meet many of the scientists so if

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
you talk one-on-one we're just

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
absolutely passionate about what we're

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,239
doing trying to make the world a better

106
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,720
place through scientific research. Uh

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,280
today I um well I'll just describe a

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,000
little bit about my own project um which

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,280
is on this theme as well um in

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,480
psychiatric um disease. The project that

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,239
I was awarded for was a very out there

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,400
kind of idea. We were working on um

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,400
looking for the underpinnings of

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,320
schizophrenia and other conditions that

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
lead to psychosis. And we collaborated

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,560
at McClean Hospital. Many of you are

117
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,320
aware of this um really premier

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,440
psychiatric research hospital that we

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,360
have here in the in the Boston area. And

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,199
our collaborators there, Bruce Mlan and

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Donna McI had collected a group of

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,560
patients that experienced psychosis and

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,199
a set that did not. And by taking cells

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,600
from those patients and studying them uh

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,400
by microscopy, we were able to identify

126
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,199
through my broadite project uh that the

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,440
mitochondria had an unusual localization

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,520
in the case of um patients that were

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,759
experiencing psychosis. And we're very

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,440
excited now that the um National

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
Institutes of Health has adopted the

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,639
project and is now doing drug screens to

133
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
try to find are there any novel

134
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,040
compounds that might do a good job of

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
shifting that localization and trying to

136
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,400
normalize the the mitochondria. So

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,160
really exciting um project that um that

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,680
would not have been funded by any other

139
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
route and that's really the point of the

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,880
Broad Knight um program. So for our

141
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,800
speakers tonight, we have um they'll be

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
sharing the the current research project

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,520
pro progress that they have from their

144
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,280
recent awards and we'll have a Q&A

145
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,520
afterwards. So the theme of tonight is

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,759
just the flow of information between

147
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,600
brain cells. When communication is

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,600
disrupted, all kinds of things can

149
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
happen and we end up with different

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,960
conditions like um Alzheimer's,

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,560
schizophrenia, bipolar and so on. And

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
what's really exciting is some of the

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,440
research that um that these uh

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,400
innovative young people have taken on.

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,320
And I'll begin um by announcing um Ralda

156
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,479
Name who is an institute scientist and

157
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
directs the stem cell program um at the

158
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,000
Stanley Center which is part of the

159
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,479
Broad Institute. And she's going to tell

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,880
us about new ways of studying brain cell

161
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,960
communication and the importance of um

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,759
of her findings for treating psychiatric

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,479
disorders. Um she is an awardee from

164
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,000
2021 and is studying a particular

165
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,120
deletion syndrome called

166
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,479
22q11.2. Perhaps you've never heard of

167
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,199
it. Um most of us have not. And while it

168
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,600
is itself a rare disease, it can inform

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,080
us about brain mechanisms that are in

170
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
common across many different disorders

171
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
and really is she's pushing the the

172
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,160
field forward in understanding brain

173
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,639
development in healthy conditions as

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,280
well as unhealthy conditions. After

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,039
that, we'll have Shaye Vong, who is a

176
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,440
graduate student very early in his

177
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,000
career in Laura Keesling's lab across

178
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,840
the street at MIT, and he will be

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,360
telling us about his work in the role of

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,600
sugars in brain disorders. And um all

181
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,479
kinds of jokes can be made about um how

182
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,240
sweet that work is. Um but he will be

183
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,319
telling us about the importance of those

184
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,039
sugars as a signaling component for

185
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,960
brain cell communication and again how

186
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
does that function in normal brain

187
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,800
development as well as um in

188
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,720
neurogenerative diseases. Uh he just

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880
received their award last year. So you

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,919
know give him some time uh that well

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,000
there will be a lot of potential

192
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,000
described in his talk as well as um what

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,840
he's accomplished so far developing

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,160
technologies to visualize and study

195
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,240
sugars in the brain. So with that, I'm

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
very pleased to invite Ralda up to

197
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,800
speak.

198
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,880
Please thank you an so much for this

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,199
lovely introduction and thank you um

200
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,160
everyone for being here today and I'm

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,720
very pleased to be able to share what my

202
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,160
lab um is working on in trying to

203
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,639
understand complex brain conditions such

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,440
as uh psychiatric conditions or mental

205
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,919
illnesses. So mental illness is really a

206
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
major global health challenge.

207
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,879
Conditions such as schizophrenia and

208
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,360
bipolar bipolar disorder can cause um

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,919
severe symptoms including mood swings,

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
hallucinations and also really increased

211
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,360
risk for suicide. And these conditions

212
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,520
affect millions of individuals and they

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,879
actually contribute to homelessness to

214
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,879
unemployment as well as incarceration.

215
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,360
And really um kind of uh like something

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,199
to take seriously is that current

217
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,520
treatment are really outdated. There

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,360
haven't been new effective therapies

219
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,280
that have been developed. Um in fact

220
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,240
many of the therapies have not changed

221
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,399
in decades and over half of the people

222
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,560
that live with these conditions still

223
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,039
really struggle with daily functioning.

224
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,360
However, there's really um hope on the

225
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,080
horizon because large-scale human

226
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,320
genetic studies have recently uncovered

227
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,720
hundreds of gene variants that they were

228
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,560
able to confidently link to these

229
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,760
conditions such as schizophrenia and

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,600
bipolar disorder. So, for the first time

231
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,839
we know what these gene variants are,

232
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,640
these um like differences in the genes,

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
these mutations. However, we don't know

234
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,120
what these um gene variants are doing.

235
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
We don't know. We and we would like to

236
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,080
understand how these gene variants

237
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,399
affect cells and cellular programs and

238
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,360
how they shape brain development and

239
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,440
function and how in some individuals

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
when we have these changes then this

241
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,920
leads to disease. So really my lab is

242
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,160
interested in understanding and bridging

243
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,480
the knowledge gap between what the gene

244
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,120
variants are and what they do at the

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,440
cellular level.

246
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,360
And I think it's fair to say that um

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
progress in developing effective

248
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,640
therapeutics for these psychiatric

249
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,279
develop conditions has stalled in large

250
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,399
part because these conditions are highly

251
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,080
complex and heterogeneous. I just told

252
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,120
you that this is the case at the genetic

253
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,880
level. So we have not only one gene but

254
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,519
hundreds of genes that have been linked

255
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,279
to a given condition. But this is also

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,440
true at the clinical level because

257
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,680
patients and patient symptoms are really

258
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,560
different from one patient to the other.

259
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,720
So the the constellation of symptoms and

260
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,279
presentations in a given individual with

261
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,800
schizophrenia for example is can be

262
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,880
quite different from the other patient.

263
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,040
So we really thought to more deeply

264
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,040
understand what is going on and how the

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,959
complexity and heterogeneity might

266
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
manifest at the cellular level because

267
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,519
we think that once we understand what's

268
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,240
not working properly at the level of the

269
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,640
cell then we can develop better ways to

270
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,200
correct

271
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,279
it. And ideally to understand this we

272
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,760
would need to be able to study and

273
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,320
manipulate the living human brain.

274
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,800
However, for many obvious reasons, this

275
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,279
is not ethical or also possible. We

276
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,360
don't really have access to human brains

277
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,040
throughout development, throughout a

278
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,200
person's life and we can't really do

279
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,040
experiments on living people. Um,

280
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,920
however, what we can do is that we can

281
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,000
study human brain cells um in the lab

282
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,839
and the way to do that is by actually

283
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,480
using human stem cells. So, um what are

284
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,440
stem cells? Stem cells are really

285
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,079
special cells that have unique

286
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,040
properties in that they can indefinitely

287
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,600
divide. So they can make more of

288
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,680
themselves but they can also turn into

289
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,800
specialized cells. So they can turn into

290
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,279
any given cell in the body uh what we

291
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,640
call differentiate. So they can become a

292
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,880
muscle cell, a neuron or a nerve cell um

293
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,279
a heart cell. And another really cool

294
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,200
aspect about human stem cells is that so

295
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,360
we can derive them from any given

296
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,959
individual anywhere in the world. So we

297
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,040
can take a blood sample or a skin biopsy

298
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,200
and then from these cells we can grow

299
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,079
them and by adding special factors to

300
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,320
them we can turn them into stem cells in

301
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,480
just a couple of months. And then once

302
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,560
we have these stem cells then we can

303
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
turn the stem cells into any cell type

304
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,079
we're interested in. You'll hear me

305
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,760
talking a lot today about brain cells.

306
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,839
So we can turn these stem cells into

307
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,880
brain cell. And again the cool thing is

308
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,279
that these when we um when we take the

309
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,040
blood sample for example from person A

310
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,839
and then make stem cells and then make

311
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,800
brain cells during all of this process

312
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,800
we preserve the whole genetic makeup of

313
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
that individual. So all of the genetic

314
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,120
information in that person is still

315
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,760
captured in the derivatives that we then

316
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,399
study.

317
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,959
So in order to enable the kind of

318
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,399
approaches to be able to study complex

319
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,000
psychiatric conditions um in cells from

320
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,639
many different people with and without

321
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,800
the diseases, we needed to first develop

322
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,480
um several tools and resources. And we

323
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,399
are fortunate to have been able to do

324
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,160
that here in our lab at the Broad

325
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,639
Institute. And I'll use this one slide

326
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,399
to take you through kind of three uh

327
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,399
kind of critical resources and tools

328
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,920
that we've developed.

329
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,639
So the first one is that we uh assembled

330
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
through a large international

331
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,480
collaboration we assembled stem cell

332
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,360
lines from over a thousand unique

333
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,320
individuals a thousand donors and for

334
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,480
each and every um stem cell line not

335
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
only have we really kind of grown very

336
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,120
high quality stem cells and were able to

337
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,240
freeze them and bank them here at the

338
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,800
broad but we also for every single um

339
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,240
stem cell line we have generated genetic

340
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,959
sequencing data

341
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,120
So we can link the genetic information

342
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,560
to what we observe at the cellular

343
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,120
level. The other key thing is that we

344
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,680
also uh over the last few years have

345
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,079
been able to develop ways to turn these

346
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,279
stem cells into different types of brain

347
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,600
cells very effectively. So we can now

348
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,639
take stem cells from hundreds of people

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,880
and turn them into specific brain cells.

350
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,160
We can do this very well and at scale in

351
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,160
the lab. And last but not le not not

352
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,880
least, I've just told you that we have

353
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,880
now a resource from over a thousand um

354
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,560
stem cell lines from a thousand people.

355
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,120
But actually stem cell work, the kind of

356
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,079
work that we do is very expensive and

357
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,560
it's ve it's very time consuming. So if

358
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,240
we wanted to examine cells from each of

359
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,360
these people carefully um all at once,

360
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,000
it could take us a really long time and

361
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,959
it could cost us a lot of money. And it

362
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,560
also each time we start an experiment

363
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,399
with one person's cells um separately it

364
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,160
also we could have some what we call

365
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,440
technical variability. Each time we

366
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
start an experiment there could be

367
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,560
little differences that we might not be

368
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,360
aware of and we have to take into

369
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,120
account in our um analysis. So to get

370
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,760
around this and be able to study cells

371
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,920
from a lot of people all at once we

372
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,079
develop different tricks to do that. And

373
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,720
one I'm highlighting here is called the

374
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,720
cell village experimental system. In

375
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,279
this system, we can mix cells from many

376
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,480
different people all together in one

377
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,639
dish. So instead of having a 100 dishes

378
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,279
to study cells from 100 people, we can

379
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,360
have just one. And that way all the

380
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,600
cells are exposed to exactly the same

381
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,639
conditions in the same dish and we can

382
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,480
then score them for different behaviors.

383
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,040
And then we actually can then use the

384
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,040
fact that each person the genome of each

385
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,600
person is unique. So it's almost like a

386
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,040
barcode that we can then use on the back

387
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,440
end to identify the person that the cell

388
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,040
belongs

389
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,839
to. Okay. So now that we have these

390
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,720
tools and resources in hand, how can we

391
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,560
then leverage them to uh unravel the

392
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,120
complexity of psychiatric

393
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,360
conditions? If we revisit um all what

394
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,120
human genetics have taught us when it

395
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
comes to schizophrenia and psychiatric

396
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,000
conditions, we can see that there's a

397
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,360
very strong signal that emerges and that

398
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,440
is uh that genes that encode synaptic

399
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,199
proteins seem to be highly involved in

400
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,880
these

401
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,720
conditions. So what are synapses?

402
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
Synapses are actually the connections

403
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,160
between two um nerve cells or two

404
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,079
neurons. And this is how neurons

405
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,800
communicate or talk to each other in the

406
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,959
brain. So one neuron neuron one which is

407
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,600
also called presinaptic neuron will send

408
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,079
a chemical signal to neuron 2 or post

409
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,920
synaptic neuron and that's how they talk

410
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:19,040
to each other and the field has largely

411
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,120
focused over the last decades on really

412
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,399
studying neurons when it comes to

413
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,360
psychiatric conditions and

414
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,519
schizophrenia.

415
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,079
However, we wondered if other cells

416
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,800
could also be involved in this process.

417
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,959
And we know for example that there's one

418
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,959
uh important cell type that is present

419
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,440
at the syninnapse and this is the

420
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,839
astrite cell type. And astrittes are um

421
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,800
are basically they make up almost half

422
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,880
of the cells in the brain and they are

423
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,759
not neurons but they provide really

424
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,519
important support for the neurons. They

425
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,040
enable neurons to develop and mature

426
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,800
properly. And again, they are this is

427
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,800
what they look like. They're beautiful

428
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,240
cells and they are a key component of

429
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,720
the synapse. So they are really

430
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,240
essential for synapse or communication

431
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,720
between neurons to happen

432
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,880
properly. So we wondered if um astroite

433
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,039
neuron interactions, the way these two

434
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,319
cell types talk to each other, if these

435
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,439
could be different in psychiatric

436
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:22,160
conditions. And so we wanted to study

437
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,160
that. And how do we study um aststery

438
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,600
neuron interaction in the dish in the

439
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,760
lab? And so we can um actually we can

440
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,000
grow neurons and aststerytes in the lab.

441
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,520
We can grow them separately each cell

442
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,760
type individually in what we call

443
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,919
monoculture or we can grow them together

444
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,000
in the same plate so that they can touch

445
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,679
each other and this is called a

446
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,520
co-ulture um

447
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,720
format. And so we did this, we studied

448
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,440
cells from roughly 80 people and um

449
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,840
their neurons um in the dish. And then

450
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,640
what we found was that when the two cell

451
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,960
types touch each other when they make

452
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,360
physical contact, we observed that at

453
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,600
that time synaptic genes are increased

454
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,240
in their expression in neurons. And that

455
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,280
was perhaps not too surprising based um

456
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,000
on what we knew about synaptic biology.

457
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,520
But the surprising part was that

458
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,360
actually when the two cell types touch

459
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,440
each other other genes are really

460
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
dramatically increased in astroytes as

461
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,840
well. So there's a lot of changes in the

462
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,799
astroite cell type and this these genes

463
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,679
included genes in cell adion. So genes

464
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,520
that enable cells to stick to each other

465
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,919
as well as genes in cholesterol

466
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,520
production. And that was surprising. Now

467
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,120
we see that when the two cell types

468
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,840
touch each other cholesterol is

469
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,160
increased in aststerytes as well as

470
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,520
sticky genes.

471
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,440
basically and I want to highlight two

472
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,400
such genes here. The first is Nurexen

473
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,720
one and Rexen one is known to be a high

474
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,760
confidence so we're quite sure that is

475
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,600
involved in schizophrenia but also in

476
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,520
autism and it has been studied for many

477
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,000
years in neurons but here we're showing

478
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,799
that actually this gene is changed in

479
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,480
the astroite cell type. So again um

480
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,240
further evidence that merits to be

481
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,360
studied in this cell type. And then the

482
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,240
second gene that's changed is um HMGCR

483
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,840
which this is a key enzyme in producing

484
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,080
cholesterol and

485
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,160
aststerytes. And um coincidentally soon

486
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,400
after we had made these observations

487
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,960
similar observations were being made

488
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,720
from studying the human brain but by our

489
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,760
colleague Steve McCarol here at the

490
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,080
broad and in a study led by Emiling and

491
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,120
Steve's lab they studied roughly uh

492
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,840
brains from 200 people um after they had

493
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,640
died and they found that these exact

494
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,360
gene expression programs were also

495
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,000
coordinated or co-regulated across

496
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,760
neurons and astrittes in the human

497
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
brain. So not only in the dish but also

498
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,679
in the human brain and postmortem brains

499
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,480
you can see the same interactions. They

500
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,760
actually termed these this program the

501
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,520
synaptic neuron aststerite program and

502
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,919
then they went on to show that these um

503
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,600
expression programs were reduced in the

504
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
brains of schizophrenia

505
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,320
individuals. All right. So what is

506
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,679
astrite doing there? So it turns out

507
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,400
that a uh astroytes are the major source

508
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,039
of cholesterol in the brain. Um

509
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,039
aststerytes make cholesterol and then

510
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,440
secreted outside the cells and then it's

511
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,480
taken up by neurons and it becomes a key

512
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,240
component of uh the membranes in neurons

513
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,159
and thus it contributes to synapsis.

514
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,480
Now when we looked at the genes that are

515
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,679
involved in making cholesterol in

516
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,080
aststerytes and and um pumping it out of

517
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,480
the cells or at the genes that are

518
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,840
involved in taking up cholesterol by

519
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,000
neurons and storing it, we noticed that

520
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,799
for many of these genes, they happen to

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,840
to be near regions of the genome that

522
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,840
are associated with schizophrenia.

523
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,280
So then we wondered well what would

524
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,840
happen if then we prevent neurons from

525
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,240
taking uh cholesterol that's made by

526
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,159
aststerytes. So we can do that by using

527
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,799
a gene editing technique called um

528
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,480
crisper interference or crisper eye. So

529
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,440
uh by doing this then we block the

530
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,880
expression of the receptors that take up

531
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,360
cholesterols. And when we did this we

532
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
observe that um there's now less

533
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,120
expression of synaptic genes and

534
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,159
neurons. So this further solidifies this

535
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,320
link between cholesterol production in

536
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,799
aststerytes and synaptic gene expression

537
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,480
in

538
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:34,880
neurons. And from there we now wanted to

539
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
understand if these genetic variations

540
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,200
that are have been documented by the

541
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,520
genetic studies to be present in in

542
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,000
individuals with schizophrenia if these

543
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,240
may affect how astroytes and neurons

544
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,640
talk to each other.

545
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,679
So to study this we first started by

546
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,320
examining one um genetic variant that is

547
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,640
considered to be the highest um genetic

548
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,640
risk factor for schizophrenia and this

549
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,320
is the 22q1 1.2 deletion that n

550
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,080
mentioned. So this is actually not only

551
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,000
uh that does it confer a high risk for

552
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,720
schizophrenia it is actually one of the

553
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,799
most common it is the most common human

554
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,520
chromosomeal deletion in human in

555
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:17,440
humans. So this removes a part of

556
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,159
chromosome 22. Um and we were able to

557
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,720
assemble a cohort of stem cells from

558
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,480
individuals that either carry or do not

559
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,520
carry the deletion and for the ones who

560
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
carry that also have

561
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,559
schizophrenia. And what we found was

562
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,960
that when we looked at the at their gene

563
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,280
expressions, we found that in neurons

564
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,919
the um genes that have been linked by

565
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,640
the genetic studies um to schizophrenia

566
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,480
and that are also synaptic genes, we saw

567
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,960
that they are decreased in their

568
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,120
expression in the neurons. And in a more

569
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,520
recent study, we also showed that the

570
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,640
astrite component of the synaptic neuron

571
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,799
astroite program that was also decreased

572
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,919
in aststerytes that carry the deletion.

573
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,880
So now we wanted um to also understand

574
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,360
if we could detect changes other than

575
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,000
just how um the expression levels of the

576
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,480
genes. So we wondered if we could uh

577
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,559
really measure how these genetic

578
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,919
influences these genetic risk factors

579
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,360
change how cells look or or cell

580
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,679
morphology. And to do that we took

581
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,520
advantage of a wonderful assay that has

582
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,120
been developed here by Anne Carpenter

583
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,280
and and Stu Shriber here at the broad

584
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,640
and that an mentioned in her talk. And

585
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,360
in this assay cell painting, you can use

586
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,480
different cell dyes to label different

587
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,720
um cell compartments or

588
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,360
organels. And so we adapted this assay

589
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,240
to make it specific to brain cells. And

590
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,159
we called this

591
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,080
neuropainting. And then we screened um

592
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,080
neuronal progenitor cells, neurons and

593
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,799
astroytes from our cohort with or

594
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:55,360
without this um risk factor, the 22q1

595
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,440
1.2 deletion. And um when we did this we

596
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,400
were able to identify that there are

597
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,640
many traits many morphological features

598
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
as we call them that are different in

599
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,039
stem cells in progenitor cells in

600
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,120
neurons and aststerytes some were

601
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,200
similar across all the different cell

602
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,919
types and some were unique to each cell

603
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,279
type these differences and um I wanted

604
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,960
to highlight one here that is a change

605
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,120
in how um the ER which is one organal

606
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,120
and the mitochondria how these two

607
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,360
organels are distributed in the cells.

608
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,760
You may be able to appreciate here how

609
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
their distribution in control cells. So

610
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,919
cells from people who do not carry the

611
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,760
deletion versus cells who carry the

612
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,279
deletion, how these look different. They

613
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880
are distributed differently in the

614
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,840
cells. So the deletion is affecting

615
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,320
that. And then we went on to link um

616
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
these changes in how the cells look and

617
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,200
how these organels are distributed. we

618
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,840
could link these to changes in um in

619
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,200
expression of specific cell adion genes,

620
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,799
genes that make cells stick to each

621
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,200
other. And because of all of our f find

622
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,760
findings on cholesterol, we actually

623
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,480
then wondered well can we look at um you

624
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,440
know cholesterol or lipid features in

625
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,840
this system. So we then incorporated

626
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,960
lipid profiling. We looked at um lipid

627
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,120
expression in um into our neuropainting

628
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,559
assay and then we screened our cohort

629
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,120
again. And what we found was that

630
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,360
actually just by looking at lipids

631
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,000
alone, by looking how these lipid

632
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,480
related traits are distributed in the

633
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,320
cells, we could tell whether a cell has

634
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,080
the deletion or not. So, um I'm sorry

635
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,080
here the the graph is a little messed up

636
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,559
here, but um in this case it shows that

637
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,679
there's much fewer lipid spots in the

638
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,279
deletion versus um without

639
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,840
it. And so the last vignette I'll tell

640
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,240
you about tonight is that is about our

641
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,200
work on um antiscychotic medications. So

642
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,200
we wanted to understand then can um

643
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,480
drugs that are typically used to treat

644
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
psychiatric conditions like

645
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,240
schizophrenia can these change how

646
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,039
neurons and astroytes talk to each other

647
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,760
or what programs are are involved there

648
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,760
and so to do that we then um took

649
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,480
neurons and astrittes that were derived

650
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,919
from many people 140 people in total and

651
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,039
we treated them with many different

652
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,640
antiscychotic medications at different

653
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,480
doses and to make a long story short

654
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
here I wanted to highlight one main

655
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,159
finding from the study

656
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and that is that the antiscychotic

657
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,760
cloopene which is one of the most

658
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,559
effective antiscychotics and I'll come

659
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,279
back to that that clipene increases

660
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,600
cholesterol production by aststerytes

661
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,159
and we found that this was true in cells

662
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,159
from every single person we looked at so

663
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,279
in this plot that I'm showing you here

664
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,760
each color corresponds to um cells from

665
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,000
a different person and how they and how

666
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,919
much cholesterol is expressed in in the

667
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,240
cells from that person and as you can

668
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,240
see the condition in the here is is um

669
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,840
cloopene and you can see that when we

670
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
treat cells with cloopene we see much

671
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,279
more cholesterol in cells from all the

672
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,320
people we looked at. So, as I mentioned,

673
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,679
Cloopene is a really effective

674
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,799
antiscychotic, but people don't really

675
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,799
understand why it works so well. And so,

676
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,720
we wondered if effects on cholesterol

677
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:15,279
production may provide an explanation.

678
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,360
And so um when we again examined our our

679
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,760
um gene expression data in our co-ulture

680
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,840
system, we found that not only does

681
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,919
cloopine in increase cholesterol

682
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,760
production in a nice dose dependent

683
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,760
manner, but it also um increases oops

684
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,919
sorry increases the expression of

685
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,760
synaptic genes and neurons also in a

686
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,080
dose dependent manner. So here we by

687
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,840
manipulating the levels of cholesterol

688
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,279
and cloopene we can also see a

689
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,240
corresponding um increase in synaptic um

690
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,919
gene expression in the

691
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,000
neurons and so and the um kind of last

692
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,240
thing I'll show you is that well what

693
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
happens when uh what what happens if we

694
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,000
add cloopene to then these um the 22q1

695
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,159
1.2 two deletion cells. I just told you

696
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
that we can see that there are many

697
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,159
changes that we can measure in how cells

698
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,080
look in cells with this deletion. And

699
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,399
well, we found that clipopine at least

700
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,320
to some extent appears to rescue some of

701
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,360
these morphological defects that are

702
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,000
related to the 22q11.2 deletion. And

703
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,360
again, so cloopene is not an ideal um

704
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,120
drug treatment. it doesn't work for

705
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,120
everyone and it also doesn't it it's

706
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,679
associated with many side effects

707
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,279
because um many metabolic side effects

708
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,600
and it effects it turns out that a lot

709
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,480
of the patients that take have increased

710
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,320
levels of lipids in their plasma perhaps

711
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,399
related to what we're showing again

712
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,799
effects on cholesterol production so can

713
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,880
we then use the tools we develop to then

714
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,559
develop eventually better treatments so

715
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,240
to sum up I've told you today that

716
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,480
astroy neuron interactions play

717
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,559
previously unappreciated roles in

718
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,399
psychiatric disorders the bi The

719
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,039
biological programs we discovered are

720
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,399
consistent with genetic studies and are

721
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,399
altered in cells from people who harbor

722
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,320
variation that's related to psychiatric

723
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,840
conditions. And finally, the fact that

724
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,279
we can manipulate these programs in

725
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,960
living human cells and modulate them

726
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,440
with drug treatment holds great promise

727
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,039
for therapeutic discovery. And I'll end

728
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,679
by thanking you for your attention,

729
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,600
thanking everybody um uh who has

730
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,520
contributed to this work. Uh especially

731
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,120
people in my lab. Um a couple of them

732
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,799
are present here. I'll give a special

733
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,240
shout out to Derek Halls who has been my

734
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,480
co-conspirator, our lab manager since I

735
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,320
uh started my lab and Jack Su as well

736
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,320
who's here and contributed to this work.

737
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,000
Our our funders obviously brought Ignite

738
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,559
and other funders and and here are the

739
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,799
people who did the work. Thank

740
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,799
you. Thank

741
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:38,000
you. And we'll we'll wait for questions

742
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,360
till the end. We'll we'll next give uh

743
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,360
Shay the chance to speak. Okay.

744
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,440
Hi everyone, thank you for being here.

745
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,480
My name is Shuer. I'm a PhD candidate at

746
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,720
MIT. I'm also a broad ignite awardee at

747
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,480
the Broad Institute. And today I'm it's

748
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,039
my pleasure to be here to tell you about

749
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,760
our work to unveil brain cells

750
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,039
sugarcoated secrets. So I want to begin

751
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,440
my talk in the country of Colombia where

752
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,600
a family suffers from a rare and

753
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,480
devastating condition. So around a

754
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,320
thousand people that lives in central

755
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,559
Columbia, almost everyone develops

756
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,720
Alzheimer's disease. And not only that,

757
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,880
everyone develops Alzheimer's disease,

758
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,919
they develop Alzheimer's much earlier

759
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,440
than the general population. And a

760
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,080
doctor has been working with this family

761
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,000
to provide care and to find out why they

762
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,600
are having this condition. And it turns

763
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,039
out they have a very rare genetic

764
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:40,480
mutation. And in this family, so this is

765
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:43,120
called a survival curve where every is a

766
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,600
way to depict how a population develop

767
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,840
disease over time. So when everyone's

768
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,679
healthy, the curves at 100 and as people

769
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,080
start to be diagnosed with conditions,

770
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,080
the curves start to drop. So as you can

771
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,880
see um by their mid4s most people would

772
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,440
have been diagnosed with cognitive mild

773
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,919
cognitive impairment which suggests

774
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,799
noticeable cognitive decline and suggest

775
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:09,440
that's an onset of Alzheimer uh symptoms

776
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,320
and by their mid50s they would have been

777
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,720
diagnosed with dementia. So it's a very

778
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,320
unfortunate devastating condition and a

779
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,559
team of Colombia doctors have been

780
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,600
working with this family to provide care

781
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,000
and to trace the family tree to figure

782
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,279
out what is happening. And what's really

783
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
interesting is that over the few the

784
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,279
past three three decades um the doctors

785
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,279
start to realize that there's some

786
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,919
outliers in this family that develop

787
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,399
this disease much later than others. And

788
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,440
in particular there's this woman that's

789
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,840
named Yria. She has this mutation that

790
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,840
would guarantee she will get Alzheimer's

791
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,720
but for some reason she didn't develop

792
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,360
any symptoms until 72. So that's almost

793
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,679
a three decade delay of symptoms symptom

794
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,679
onset compared to other members of the

795
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,120
family. Of course the doctor and

796
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,360
scientists become very interested in

797
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,240
this case because understanding what's

798
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,279
protecting her could inform us to

799
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,120
develop therapeutics can benefit the

800
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
over 30 million patients who are

801
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,840
suffering from Alzheimer's in the world

802
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,880
today.

803
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,679
And so she unfortunately she passed away

804
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,559
in 2020 from cancer and she generally

805
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,640
donated her brain for science. But while

806
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,600
she was still alive they invited her to

807
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,080
come to Boston to get some brain scans

808
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,559
in the Massachusetts General Hospital.

809
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,559
So this is PET scans of her brain when

810
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:34,880
she was just starting to have cog

811
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,120
cognitive impairment and the the redder

812
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,080
brain region is suggest she has a higher

813
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,320
level of the toxic proteins in that

814
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,320
region. So when they looked at amaloid

815
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,799
beta which is the most well-known

816
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,120
hallmark for Alzheimer's disease she has

817
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,519
exceptionally high level of amaloid beta

818
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,120
compared to patients that from that

819
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,440
family in their mid-4s when they're

820
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,440
starting to develop symptoms. However,

821
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,720
when they looked at the T protein named

822
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,480
Tao, also another well-known marker for

823
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,880
Alzheimer's, she has relatively moderate

824
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,600
level of TW compared to other patients

825
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,080
and they did more test and she showed

826
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,360
that she has very minimal cell

827
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:16,480
degeneration which explains her avoiding

828
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,880
the disease. So what this suggests is

829
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,480
that for some reason the disease

830
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,159
progression is impeded in her brain and

831
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,960
that causes a resistance to the

832
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,880
Alzheimer pathology and that's really

833
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,200
interesting. So the doctor performed all

834
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,240
kinds of test including sequencing her

835
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,480
whole genome to identify so she has this

836
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,080
mutation that causes Alzheimer maybe she

837
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,720
has something else that's protecting her

838
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,200
from Alzheimer's. and they found a very

839
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,120
interesting hit. Um, so if you're paying

840
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,360
attention, so Rod's talk also mentioned

841
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,039
this protein called APOE. So this is a

842
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,799
protein that's very important for lipid

843
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,080
metabolism. So this protein helps to

844
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,519
shift lipid around your body including

845
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,320
cholesterol. But interestingly, the gene

846
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,200
that encodes this protein, the gene APOE

847
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,519
is also the best predictive gene we have

848
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,080
for Alzheimer risk. So when you have a

849
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,399
genetic testing based on your gene

850
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,159
composition for APOE, they can predict

851
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,079
your risk of getting Alzheimer's in the

852
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,800
future. So this is a very interesting

853
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,040
hit because that suggests this could be

854
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,240
a major reason why she has this

855
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,960
resistance to Alzheimer's disease. And

856
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,520
the mutation in this APOE which is named

857
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,000
Christ Church uh happens to be in the

858
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,800
region of APOE where the APOE protein

859
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,800
uses to bind a self-s surface sugar on

860
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,119
the uh brain cells. And indeed when the

861
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,320
researchers tested whether the

862
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,960
interaction is intact it turns out this

863
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,079
mutation which is called AP3 it's Christ

864
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,079
church does affect the interaction

865
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,240
between APOE and the brain sugar. Um so

866
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,040
this is a biochemistry essay that test

867
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,440
the binding between protein and sugar.

868
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,280
Um however of course this is very

869
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,440
exciting which this is a new direction

870
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,839
for us to look into to understand

871
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,680
Alzheimer and potential therapeutics but

872
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,000
at the same time um the sugar they use

873
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,320
in this case called hperin is only an

874
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,920
analog of the actual sugar in the brain

875
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,520
suggest they might not be representative

876
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,000
of what's actually happening in the

877
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,839
human brain and also this is just about

878
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,359
chemical essay and a lot more work is

879
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,680
needed to actually understand the

880
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,359
biology of how this sugar works in the

881
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,200
human brain.

882
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,400
So I want to give a little introduction

883
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,079
of the sugar in your brain. Um so it's

884
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,760
not very well known but all of the sugar

885
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,040
in your brain and actually in your body

886
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,720
are covered all the cells are covered by

887
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:42,240
sugars and I want to introduce a new

888
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,320
term here. So for a biochemist when a

889
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,760
series of sugars that's connected into a

890
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,760
sombo we call this a glyen and every

891
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,359
cell has all kinds of glycans on the

892
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,960
surface and they all have different

893
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,800
functions and they all interact with

894
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,359
different partners but very

895
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,440
interestingly apo mainly interacts with

896
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,280
this particular sugar called hyperin

897
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,480
sulfate and that will be the topic of my

898
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,800
talk and here's a picture of a group of

899
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,680
cells with hypernulfate visualized on

900
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,440
the surface

901
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,440
And you can see we're looking down on

902
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,680
this population of cells and we can see

903
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,520
the nucleus where DNA is and you can see

904
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,599
the hyper sulfate on the surface that's

905
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,839
pointing out and you can see this sugar

906
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,520
acts as a barrier between the cell and

907
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,800
the

908
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,800
outside and we know that this sugar

909
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,640
plays very important roles in the brain.

910
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,720
So one example is when your brain is

911
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,079
developing. Um so when your brain is

912
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,320
developing from embryo to a person a lot

913
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,320
of communication is require required for

914
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,119
the cells to know where to go and what

915
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,520
type of cell they should become. And

916
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,000
here's the study in the mouse brain. If

917
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,160
we remove the sugar as a channel for

918
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,160
cells to communicate with each other we

919
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,680
we actually see major disruptions in the

920
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,520
formation of different brain regions.

921
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,119
You can see this is the alactory bulb

922
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,280
and that's completely missing in the

923
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,839
mouse that's missing this sugar and we

924
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,200
also observe significant uh disruption

925
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,599
in the connection between different

926
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,400
brain regions. So this sugar is critical

927
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,160
for for brain development. We also know

928
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,920
that this sugar is very important for

929
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,680
synapse formation. So synapse is how

930
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,560
your brain cell connect with each other

931
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,640
and if we remove this sugar the synapse

932
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,359
will become dysfunctional and the signal

933
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,640
cannot be transmitted as efficiently.

934
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,560
And here we also have the example

935
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,480
showing this sugar is very important in

936
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,040
the process of neuro degeneration.

937
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,800
Understanding that can be very valuable.

938
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,040
However, our understanding is still

939
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,800
quite limited mostly because we don't

940
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,800
have good tools to study the sugar in

941
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,880
the brain. If you notice how I describe

942
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,760
these studies, the best tool we have

943
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,240
right now is to remove this sugar from

944
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,599
its biological context and see how the

945
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,839
system dysfunctions. However, just by

946
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,839
removing it, so say this is important

947
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,359
because the system's broken doesn't

948
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,599
really doesn't help us to fully

949
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,960
understand what it's doing in the brain.

950
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,560
So what what my PhD is focused on is to

951
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,480
develop tools to actually start to

952
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,320
visualize this sugar in the brain

953
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,880
context so we can understand how it

954
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,440
works. And the technology that we use is

955
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,680
called expansion microscopy. So the

956
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,440
major challenge of studying molecules in

957
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,280
the brain is because they're too close

958
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,280
to each other to be distinguished from

959
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,800
each other. So why don't we just move

960
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,280
them apart from each other? So that's

961
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,119
what this technology does. By forming a

962
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,599
polymer that's commonly used in baby

963
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,320
diapers and contacts in the brain

964
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,720
tissue, we're able to physically magnify

965
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,240
the brain by bringing all the molecules

966
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,119
apart from each other while still

967
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,599
preserving the overall organization. So

968
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,240
now using a conventional microscope we

969
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,280
can get state-of-the-art images of how

970
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,440
molecules are organized in the brain

971
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,480
tissue and we apply this technology to

972
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,720
visualize these sugars. So this is human

973
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,040
potent stem cell is a cell that's in the

974
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,680
development stage and I show this image

975
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,680
before. Um so we can see this hyper

976
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,160
sulfate glycans um as very hairy

977
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,520
extended structures on the cell surface

978
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,520
and very interestingly when we

979
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,800
differentiate the cells into motor

980
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,880
neurons so neurons that's uh more ter in

981
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,000
terminal state all of these sugars

982
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,520
become very curled up on the cell

983
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,760
surface and this is very surprising

984
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,280
because for a long time scientists have

985
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,359
always saw these sugars are just

986
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,000
floating uncontrollably on the cell

987
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,760
surface but what this means is that

988
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,079
there the cells actually control the

989
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,000
structure of these sugars on the surface

990
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,000
to make sure that they function as

991
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,920
they're intended to. However, this is

992
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,400
these samples are expanded around four

993
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,599
four-fold. So, it's still quite limited

994
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,680
in terms of resolution. Um, so one thing

995
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,839
I developed during my PhD is I

996
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,920
engineered the polymer that's used to

997
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,320
expand this tissues. So, this is just a

998
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,960
pure polymer. We will in reality we'll

999
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,599
embed biological samples in these

1000
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,680
hydrogels to actually blow them up. But

1001
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,920
you can see this is the same gel before

1002
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,880
and after expansion in the same dish. So

1003
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,720
this gel is able to expand up to 20fold

1004
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,880
while still holding its shape and

1005
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,839
holding all the spatial relationship

1006
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,680
intact. And with the more advanced

1007
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,320
expansion technology, we're actually

1008
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,760
able to start to zoom in on the fine

1009
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,160
details of molecules. So this is uh

1010
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,000
different synapses in the mouse brain

1011
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,920
and I zoom in on to three different

1012
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,480
synapses. So we mentioned the synapses

1013
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,400
connection between neurons neurons. So

1014
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,000
there's a cell that's sending the signal

1015
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
and there's a cell that's receiving the

1016
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,680
signal. And if we look at the proteins

1017
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,599
that's sending the signal and the

1018
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,440
proteins receiving the signal, we see

1019
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,680
the shape of the synapse very clearly

1020
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,320
with this technology. And we can also

1021
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,000
see the space between the synapse.

1022
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,440
That's the distance the signal that

1023
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,839
needs to travel.

1024
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,800
So we start to apply this technology to

1025
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,800
the sugar and another advancement of the

1026
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,079
technology we start to use is to

1027
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,400
recognize that actually there are

1028
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,800
different flavors of this same sugar. So

1029
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,440
it's the same type of molecules but they

1030
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,640
actually go through extensive

1031
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,240
multiplications. So they interact with

1032
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,319
different kinds of partners and we

1033
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,560
haven't really had the ability to

1034
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,200
recognize how these different flavors

1035
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,040
work in the biological context. So we

1036
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,800
start to apply these different protein

1037
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,520
probes that can recognize these

1038
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,839
different flavors in the same cell to

1039
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,560
start to look at how the these different

1040
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,640
sequences distribute. Um so on the left

1041
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,640
we have two different probes on

1042
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,000
different population of cells and on the

1043
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,440
right we have a different probe and then

1044
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,119
just visually you can see there's a

1045
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,880
difference where these two probes start

1046
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,079
to recognize these glycans that's

1047
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,400
pointing outside of the cell. This probe

1048
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,200
only looks at glycans that's very close

1049
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,119
to the cell surface. And when we zoom in

1050
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,680
onto this population, you can see these

1051
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,680
two probes really don't overlap in terms

1052
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:52,319
of what they recognize. And if we when

1053
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,240
we expand these samples 20fold, what we

1054
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,160
start to see is that these different

1055
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,240
sequences, different flavors, they

1056
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,680
actually arrange spatially different

1057
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,079
along this one glycan. So what that

1058
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,839
suggests is that not only the structure

1059
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,160
of these glycans are controlled on the

1060
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,480
cell surface, even the different

1061
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,800
modifications are very carefully placed

1062
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,160
on the glycans by the cells which was

1063
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,319
previously not observed. And what this

1064
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,800
really shows is that there's a very

1065
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,760
complex machinery that the cell deploys

1066
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,760
to control the sugars to accomplish the

1067
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,960
critical roles they need in terms of

1068
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,880
cell cell communications.

1069
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,240
And on top of that, we start to apply

1070
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,040
this technology to study Alzheimer's. So

1071
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,680
this is the same human brain tissue from

1072
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,640
a patient after they passed away. And

1073
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,000
we're starting to visualize this sugar

1074
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,160
hyper sulfate as well as other proteins

1075
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,160
that's significant for Alzheimer's. And

1076
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,960
what we're starting to visualize is that

1077
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,200
this sugar is collocicalizing with the

1078
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,400
key players of Alzheimer's. And we're

1079
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,599
going to look into how they're

1080
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,400
interacting and also look into what

1081
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,000
other potential partners like proteins

1082
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,839
the sugar is interacting with and if we

1083
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,640
disrupt the APOE sugar interactions like

1084
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,200
in that patient how will the system

1085
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,880
change which will hopefully like lead to

1086
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,599
deeper understanding of the disease and

1087
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,520
well as potential therapeutic

1088
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,880
directions. So in conclusion of my talk

1089
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,040
I would like to present three takeaways.

1090
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,839
The first is every cell in your brain is

1091
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,000
covered by sugars and evidence indicate

1092
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,319
that they play critical roles in cell

1093
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,960
cell communications as well as diseases

1094
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,720
such as Alzheimer's

1095
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,960
disease. Our understanding of biology

1096
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,119
and disease is driven by the development

1097
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,119
of different tools such as the tool of

1098
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,480
physically enlarging a brain to look at

1099
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:52,079
things clearer and breakthrough in our

1100
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,000
understanding. Our sincere hope is that

1101
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,000
that can lead to diagnostics and

1102
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,839
therapeutics for different diseases such

1103
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,640
as therapeutic cancer and even

1104
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,640
potentially aging. So with that I would

1105
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,400
like to thank my PhD adviserss for

1106
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,200
providing like great opportunity to work

1107
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,000
on these problems. I want to thank our

1108
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,160
collaborators collaborators also both in

1109
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,400
the lab and around the world and I want

1110
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,960
to thank all the donors who donated

1111
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,960
their body for science and also all the

1112
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,200
funding sources especially bro ignite

1113
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,280
which enabled this work. Thank you for

1114
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,280
your attention.

1115
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,920
Wonderful. Thank you so much. Um I I

1116
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,880
find this really fascinating as an

1117
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,640
example. the pair of you are um and

1118
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,720
please get ready to ask questions. Raise

1119
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,119
your hand and a m microphone will come

1120
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,440
to you. I just find it fascinating that

1121
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,319
there are so many different styles of

1122
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,880
science. Um so you are clearly zooming

1123
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,440
in very very far to look at the synapses

1124
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,800
at the tip of a little arm that is at

1125
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,280
the end of a very large neuron um inside

1126
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,960
a brain inside a human. Whereas Ralda,

1127
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,040
you're sort of zooming out. let's get

1128
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,359
this population of patients and look at

1129
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,280
lots of different samples um and and to

1130
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,640
look at the the structures there. So

1131
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,079
just I just find this really

1132
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,400
fascinating. The one thing you had in

1133
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,640
common though is each of these projects

1134
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,040
involved quite a cast of characters and

1135
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,560
I think that's pretty typical. Um so

1136
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,040
let's turn to questions from the

1137
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,920
audience.

1138
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,480
Uh very interesting from both of you. I

1139
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,720
was wondering when you mentioned the uh

1140
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,599
uh cell colonies or villages um how the

1141
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,119
mixture of cells from different people

1142
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,440
in the same dish

1143
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:41,119
uh whether these cells interact in some

1144
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,839
way and how do you account for that?

1145
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,920
Yeah. Um so it's it's something that we

1146
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,640
are studying right we can take a little

1147
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,640
bit to our advantage if we kind of study

1148
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,960
how cells from a person that don't have

1149
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,319
a particular genetic variant how they

1150
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,359
interact with the cells with a person

1151
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,040
that has. So these kinds of

1152
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:01,599
interactions we can study if we can

1153
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:05,040
control them but for the most part in

1154
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,520
the village system we study um what we

1155
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,240
call cell intrinsic behavior. So

1156
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,480
behavior within each cell. So when it

1157
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,200
comes to the gene expression programs,

1158
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,960
we tend to avoid looking at um what is

1159
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,319
expressed outside of the cells or

1160
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,839
secreted um or cell extrinsic behaviors

1161
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,599
because this is too complicated to

1162
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,599
measure with the village system. That's

1163
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:31,760
a good rock heat may affect your overth.

1164
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,200
Yep. Was it that um so yeah so the the

1165
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,280
kind of really important thing which I

1166
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,359
didn't really discuss is that we also

1167
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,720
have repeated a lot of what we

1168
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,640
established first the system and

1169
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,599
whenever we make a finding we also

1170
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,520
repeat the same experiments um to what

1171
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,760
we what we say validate them to make

1172
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,760
sure that we make the same observations

1173
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,520
when we culture cells from each person

1174
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,520
separately. So yeah, absolutely.

1175
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,240
Um I I totally understand your research

1176
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,359
is extremely necessary in both your

1177
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,760
cases, you know, squidia, Alzheimer's.

1178
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,599
My question

1179
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,079
is is this pie in the sky kind of

1180
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,640
research or how far are you from

1181
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,280
practical real world therapeutics? I

1182
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,480
mean is it you know are you at the nent

1183
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,319
level you know are you 20 years away

1184
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,560
that's a that's I love this question so

1185
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,040
let me first give some context that it

1186
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,839
currently takes somewhere between$1 and6

1187
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,520
billion dollars to develop a new drug um

1188
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,079
as you can imagine the the broad's

1189
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,520
entire operating budget is uh not quite

1190
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:42,240
that huge um and um and it typically

1191
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,040
takes something at a absolute absolute

1192
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,760
minimum about 10 years um typically more

1193
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,680
like 15 to to go from an idea of what

1194
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,839
might make a good drug and and onward.

1195
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,599
So the broad usually sits at pretty

1196
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,240
early in that that spectrum, but I'm

1197
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,079
very curious to to hear the answer of um

1198
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,920
how what are what are maybe what are the

1199
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,000
next steps and kind of how long do you

1200
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,160
foresee till something could come of

1201
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,839
your research in your patients? Yeah,

1202
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,520
maybe I can start by saying that so in

1203
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:11,119
in psychiatry for example for

1204
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,119
schizophrenia in the last 60 50 60 years

1205
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,359
there really has have not been any major

1206
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,280
new drugs that have come on the market

1207
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,599
and this is for many reasons like I said

1208
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,079
because uh like these are brain diseases

1209
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,920
it's very hard to access the human brain

1210
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,480
and we know people have typically

1211
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,400
studied mice for example animal models

1212
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,200
but there are so many differences in

1213
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,839
both the the genes but also kind of how

1214
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,839
the brain like structurally and you know

1215
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,240
mice and humans. So that we really

1216
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,920
needed an animal a human system to be

1217
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,079
able to study these disorders. I mean

1218
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,240
not exclusively right but this is one of

1219
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,920
the reasons and and um and the the other

1220
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,760
thing here is that with the tools and

1221
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,920
technology for the first time right now

1222
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,040
we really have the tools in hand to be

1223
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,200
able to study such complex disorders. So

1224
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,119
with assays such as you know the cell

1225
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,000
painting that an has developed first and

1226
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:05,599
that we are really trying to leverage we

1227
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,160
can cheaply and quickly screen. So now

1228
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,920
we know you know we we are starting to

1229
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,240
understand what to look for what are the

1230
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,240
defect at the cellular level. So now we

1231
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,000
actually can screen drug libraries to

1232
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,079
figure to try to identify ways to

1233
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,680
correct them and then hoping to get

1234
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,599
closer to a treatment that actually

1235
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,280
works in patients. Right? So there's

1236
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,599
always back and forths but we hope that

1237
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,280
with the tools present today that that

1238
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,960
we are getting closer. Yeah. And I can

1239
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,200
answer from the perspective also of

1240
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,920
seeing startups that um that in that

1241
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,520
incubate and launch out of the broad um

1242
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,280
when you do a drug screen and get a

1243
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,119
promising first chemical. It usually

1244
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,040
takes a couple of years to optimize the

1245
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,200
chemical and then it takes a couple of

1246
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,680
years to test its safety in usually

1247
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,000
mouse models but now other alternatives.

1248
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,079
um but still a couple of years. Um and

1249
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,920
then you file with the FDA and go to

1250
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,240
human trials. So it's probably about

1251
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,480
let's say five years total from from

1252
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,720
having a good starting point. Yeah.

1253
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,640
Yeah. Yeah. And I think I would add that

1254
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,960
if you have been following therapeutics

1255
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,480
in the Alzheimer's space, I think there

1256
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,640
have been several drugs that's been

1257
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,960
approved, but there's no evidence

1258
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,880
showing that they're super effective. So

1259
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,280
I think a lot of what we're doing is

1260
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,119
also like we of course we want the cure

1261
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,960
as fast as possible but at the same time

1262
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,480
we need to do it the right way and to

1263
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,400
make sure we actually fully understand

1264
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,400
the disease y to know what we're going

1265
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,400
after. Once it gets to human clinical

1266
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,000
trials that can be usually years

1267
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,760
especially if it's a disease that takes

1268
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,359
a while to develop. Um it takes a while

1269
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,359
to know if your drug is working. So if

1270
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,800
it takes several years and usually tens

1271
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,880
to hundreds of millions of dollars for

1272
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,800
that human clinical trial stage we don't

1273
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,559
want to blow it having having messed up

1274
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,280
at an earlier stage. That's a really

1275
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,720
great point. Another question here. Uh

1276
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,800
yeah, thank you both of you for the

1277
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,839
wonderful presentation. My question is

1278
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,559
very simple. How do you convert a stem

1279
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,559
cell into a neuron or any other type of

1280
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,599
cell? So you can take a stem cell and

1281
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,680
make it into any other form of cell. How

1282
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,480
do you do that? What's the process? And

1283
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:03,359
yeah, so actually we can add um to the

1284
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,760
stem cells. We can try to make some

1285
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,000
genes become expressed and other genes

1286
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,160
stop to be expressed. So we know what

1287
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,680
these are based on our understanding of

1288
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,920
human development, human brain

1289
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,480
development. And so we can what we call

1290
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,640
our transcription factors. So these are

1291
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,520
like gene products that control how

1292
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,520
other genes are expressed. So we can add

1293
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,040
these transcription factors to the cells

1294
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,359
for example and push them to become

1295
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,960
neurons or we can block other genes from

1296
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,440
being expressed by adding some chemicals

1297
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,440
or small molecule.

1298
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,760
Leard.

1299
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,960
Hi. Uh you mentioned that cloopene by

1300
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,800
increasing cholesterol uh production

1301
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,400
affects neuron communication. I was

1302
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,880
wondering does it distinguish between

1303
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,920
low and high density cholesterol and uh

1304
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:02,240
other aspects of are lipids somehow

1305
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,760
involved in the communication? So yeah,

1306
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,359
so this is something that we have not

1307
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,040
really studied what we call lipid

1308
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,800
species. I have to say that the kind of

1309
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,800
version of cholesterol that's present in

1310
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,119
the brain is a little different right

1311
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,880
but what I can say I mentioned that

1312
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,200
clipopine is associated with side

1313
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,440
effects in patients and these are um

1314
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,800
often metabolic side effects including

1315
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,119
more um lipids in their in their blood

1316
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,920
that can be measured. So my guess would

1317
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,680
be that it does not um so these side

1318
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,079
effects are because they affect the

1319
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,960
heart. So we aspire and we hope to be

1320
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,960
able to develop a drug that would kind

1321
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,480
of increase cholesterol in the brain but

1322
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,800
not somewhere else so that would not

1323
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,280
cause these you know heart issues

1324
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,200
eventually.

1325
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:48,079
Yeah. Great. And we'll take one last

1326
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,000
question here. Thank you. Hi very

1327
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,000
interesting talk. Thank you so much. Uh

1328
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,200
I have a question around clinical

1329
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,079
trials. So if I understand correctly uh

1330
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,040
determining end points is somewhat

1331
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,240
difficult in such diseases like

1332
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,720
Alzheimer's. So some of the techniques

1333
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,520
you are developing would that make it

1334
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,440
easier because now you have more of a

1335
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,559
analytical techniques though what

1336
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,920
exactly is happening with the brain

1337
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,400
cells and can you describe what is an

1338
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,880
end point a clinical endpoint?

1339
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,440
Um yeah I I guess I'll start but then

1340
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,079
you can go back to him. Um, so I think

1341
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,319
yeah, exactly. This is so by basically

1342
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,000
being able to quickly be able to access

1343
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,760
cells from different people that have or

1344
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,760
do not have a certain genetic like a

1345
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,440
certain mutation. For example, our hope

1346
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,200
is that we can screen quickly because in

1347
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,440
the dish it takes, you know, just only a

1348
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,240
few weeks to be able to screen. We can

1349
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,400
measure um how the the communication

1350
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,079
between the uh like the synapses between

1351
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,079
the nerve cells. We can count them. We

1352
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,240
can measure the cholesterol production

1353
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,079
and we can then quickly screen for drugs

1354
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,680
that Yeah. So these are the end points

1355
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,240
or the the phenotypes that we measure

1356
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,079
but yeah or the sugars right that I

1357
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,839
think just to disclaimer my PhD is not

1358
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,760
in like clinical size I don't know as

1359
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,079
much about clinical trials but I would

1360
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,200
say yeah I think just more methods to

1361
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,440
analyze what's happening in patients in

1362
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,599
model systems would help us to at least

1363
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,520
have a better idea to set end point

1364
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,280
before the trial begins because I think

1365
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,800
that's what that's the challenges you

1366
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,960
see with Alzheimer's is that a lot of

1367
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,760
clinical trials were complete first and

1368
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,319
then they start to just the criteria to

1369
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,000
make the drug effective which is not

1370
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,920
science supposed to be done like I

1371
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,920
understand clinical trial is complicated

1372
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,280
and real world changes things but at the

1373
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,319
same time like that's what we should

1374
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,079
avoid. Wonderful. Thank you so much for

1375
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,560
sharing your science clearly tonight.

1376
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:43,020
Please join me in thanking these folks.

1377
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:43,020
[Applause]
