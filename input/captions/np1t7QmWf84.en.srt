00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,920
So, welcome again. This is MIT Startup

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,680
Exchange Demo Day. We're excited to have

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,160
you whether this is the first time

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,200
joining us or you've been with us before

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,440
and you're back.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,960
So, you're going to uh soon hear from

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,359
eight exciting startups. They're all

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,680
members of Startup Exchange. But first,

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,680
I will give a brief introduction of our

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
program.

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,679
So MIT startup exchange was created to

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,079
support MIT connected startups as they

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,239
grow, expand and help solve some of the

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,680
world's greatest challenges. And we do

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,440
this by fostering partnerships and

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
collaborations between the startups and

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,399
industry primarily members of the

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,760
industrial leazison program or ILP which

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
are represented by so many of you

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,680
joining us today and also the MIT

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,680
innovation ecosystem and beyond.

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,360
The MIT um startups in our program have

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
a strong connection to the institute and

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,359
they may be based on MIT licensed

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
technology or founded by MIT faculty,

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,920
staff or alumni. They've also may be

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,040
vetted by some of our MIT peers

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,479
including the engine start nano or CEL

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,320
startup connect plus.

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
We have around a thousand startups in

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,759
the program and they usually join at

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,640
pilot stage or beyond and they can

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,880
represent any sector and any geography

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,080
and here you can see the breath of

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
solutions some of the trending

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,560
technologies of MIT startups and I've

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,880
noted in bold those that are represented

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,040
by the startups here today of course we

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,000
start with AI and ML big data and

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,880
analytics sustainability robotics and

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,439
sensing and healthcare and life science

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,439
among others

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,880
And so when it comes to value,

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
everything that we do at Startup

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,759
Exchange is about exposing the startups

46
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,200
and making connections with industry for

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,360
possible partnerships and

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
collaborations. And we do this in a

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,240
variety of ways

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,159
and um in a very customized approach. So

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,479
I hope that everyone is taking advantage

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
of these benefits. For example, we

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,479
launch calls for startups and we call

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,280
these opportunities and they're based on

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,440
a corporate's uh priorities and internal

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
challenges. And so as a startup, you can

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,440
apply on our website and if selected,

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
you can work with a an IP member um to

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
help them solve a problem that they may

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,520
be facing in the industry. We also host

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,840
one-on-one meetings, demo days like

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,239
today, conferences, other webinars and

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,840
um different events have a um lightning

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,440
talk for startups and and an exhibit and

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
we also host sometimes workshops and

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,319
trainings sometimes in conjunction with

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,319
our MIT peers.

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,800
And so what is demo day? It's a virtual

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
event that we host on a quarterly basis.

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,280
It's a forum that is pretty interactive

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,400
and dynamic. So I hope it will be that

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,080
today as well. And we help facilitate

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
corporate interactions with the industry

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
ready startups in our program. And the

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,080
goal is that this can happen sooner

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
rather than later. It's a short and

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
sweet format where you can meet a lot of

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,159
the startups and see if there's

79
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,000
potential to work together.

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,120
The format today will consist of eight

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,360
startups. They will present for uh four

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
minutes and we'll follow up with a

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
couple of minutes of Q&A and then we'll

84
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,800
go right into breakout room so that

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
there can be more engagement. So please

86
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,840

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,599
