00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,759
from the MIT Energy Initiative. This is

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,240
What If It Works, a podcast looking at

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,679
the energy solutions for climate change.

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,960
Today we're talking with Yakabo Bonjouro

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,240
about a source of energy that's drawn a

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,920
lot of fashion and a lot of controversy.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,880
Nuclear. If an individual were to use

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,120
only nuclear energy for his or her

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,800
energy needs throughout the lifetime,

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,280
you would produce an amount of spent

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,920
fuel or waste that would fit within a

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,840
coffee cup. Yakapo is the director of

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,360
the center for advanced nuclear energy

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,960
systems and a professor in the

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,000
department of nuclear science and

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,399
engineering at MIT. the United States

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,320
where we consume a lot of electricity. A

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,320
gigawatt reactor, a gigawatt plant

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,199
basically would be enough to power a

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,719
city the size of Boston,

24
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,680
750,000

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,199
people/housel. It's a big chunk of

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,200
power. He argues you can't get to a

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,400
robust clean energy portfolio without

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,640
nuclear. But that doesn't mean the road

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,600
ahead's going to be easy for those who

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,960
advocate for nuclear. At least not in

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,560
the US. What it has to do with is the

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,759
the way in which the process to select,

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
license, and eventually operate a final

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,200
repository. The way in which that

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
process has evolved in the United States

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,600
has been characteristically

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,479
dysfunctional, if I can put it that way.

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,439
Here's Yakapo in conversation with me

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,119
and Rob. I'll start off with a a little

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,479
bit of a funny question maybe, but do

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,119
people ever meet you, hear what you do,

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,840
and say, "Really? You go around the

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,920
world supporting more nuclear power?" Do

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,479
you ever get that kind of shocked

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,640
reaction? No, I actually I don't think I

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,200
get shock. I get uh curiosity and

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,439
interest. I think people find general

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
topic of energy and particular energy

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,399
intriguing. And so sometimes they ask

50
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,840
questions. Sometimes they say, "Wow,

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,920
sounds really challenging. Sounds really

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,000
difficult." And it sort of makes sense

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
with being a professor of MIT. You know,

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
people immediately give you credit and

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,440
then you need to sort of confirm that

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
you know what you're talking about.

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,680
That's the reaction. Now, that's not the

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
reaction you get in Italy or New Zealand

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
where I was last week. They're, you

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
know, strongly anti-uclear.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
Well, I can't comment on New Zealand

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
because it's a situation that I don't

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,440
know. Well, um, growing up in Italy, of

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,519
course, I was exposed to a lot of, um,

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,840
you know, opposition to nuclear, but my

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
understanding is that the, uh, current,

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
uh, government, the current

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,640
administration in Italy actually has,

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,640
uh, made a significant overture, uh, for

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,400
nuclear and, um, we'll see where it

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,959
goes. I am generally skeptical about

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
things getting done in Italy uh just

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
because the country tends to be a little

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,760
bit dysfunctional and decisions are made

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,680
and when the political landscape changes

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,239
those decisions are reversed that's all

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,959
but you know at the moment even in Italy

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,440
which is usually hopeless u the wind

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,680
seems to have changed you want to edit

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,920
any of this out

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
no not at all no no I feel comfortable

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,519
badmouthing it's my own country so I can

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,560
say whatever I want

84
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,640
Um, what's the toughest country you can

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,440
remember ever sort of trying to make the

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,879
case to or where people were the most

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,040
resistant to what you had to say about

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,200
nuclear? Yeah, I think that's an easy

89
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,959
question. It has been for the past 15

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,360
years, maybe even longer than that, has

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,519
been Germany. Okay. Yeah. And why? Well,

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
they have a long history of nuclear

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
opposition which goes back to the Cold

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,239
War. In fact, I'm told right after World

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
War II sort of they conflated the

96
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,720
opposition to nuclear weapons with

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,959
opposition to nuclear energy. I see. And

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,360
that persisted certainly the general

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,280
population maybe in the political arena

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
a little bit less. There were ups and

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,400
downs. the um the administration of

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,799
Prime Minister um Schroeder in the '9s

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,799
actually passed a nuclear phase out

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,080
policy which then was put on pause by

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,560
Angela Merkel during her first term. But

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
then Fukushima happened and then the

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,120
country just decided they wanted to

108
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,720
phase out and they finally did it. Uh

109
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,800
last year they shut down their last

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
nuclear power plant and predictably

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
their emissions have gone up. They had

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,560
to restart some coal fire plants. It's

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
been a complete mess, but they no longer

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,120
have nuclear energy in Germany. So,

115
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
that's always been sort of a tough

116
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,840
audience. Uh, of course, they've got a

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
wonderful neighbor with nuclear in

118
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,160
France that supplies some of the

119
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,000
electricity to the European grid. Uh, a

120
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,240
lot of the electricity to the European

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,919
grid and I think the by far the lion

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
share of the of the carbon-f free

123
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,600
electricity. So, it's interesting to see

124
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
two countries that they're very

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
different, but in many ways they have

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
such strong ties. They've really gone

127
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,080
two different directions and it has been

128
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,759
that way for a long time. So let's just

129
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,919
step back because in the back of

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,960
everybody's mind is some sort of nuclear

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,400
accident in Chernobyl through my

132
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,160
Fukushima. What is the essence of the

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,840
case that you make to a politician or

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
regular person who's trying to think

135
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
like hm would we want nuclear around

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,080
here? Well the first thing I will say

137
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
that there are risks associated with all

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
technologies not just energy

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,919
technologies. Everything we do as human

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,600
beings entails a risk and we just have

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,120
to weigh what the benefits are and what

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
the risks are and then decide is it

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,680
acceptable or not. But having said that

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,919
the value proposition for nuclear in the

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,320
current context is in my opinion

146
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,199
three-fold. First obviously we're all

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,120
concerned about greenhouse gas emissions

148
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,080
and how we're going to address climate

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,240
change mitigation as well as adaptation.

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,160
And needless to say all lowcarbon energy

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,479
technologies can potentially play a

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
role. The specific role that nuclear can

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,360
play is not only being low carbon,

154
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
carbon free if you will during

155
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,320
operation, but it's also dispatchable,

156
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,080
stable, reliable. So it's not subject to

157
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,360
intermittency. And so dispatchable

158
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
meaning you can make it come on when you

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
want and you can make it go off when you

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,639
don't want it to some extent. Correct.

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,280
Yeah. You can control basically the

162
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,880
energy output of your system to some

163
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
extent. Right. Because these are not

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,960
systems that are designed to go up and

165
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,120
down in power very very rapidly. There

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479
are both economic and technical reasons

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
for why you don't want to do that, but

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,479
pretty much you can you can get the

169
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,919
output that you want uh within within

170
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,520
reasonable limits. And are you

171
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,280
contrasting that with kind of like solar

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,880
and wind and wind which are great,

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
they're cheap as we know, they're also

174
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,560
low carbon, but you're subject to

175
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
intermittency. And so all the studies

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,880
that we've done at this point, many

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,240
other groups have done around the world

178
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,639
um show that the generation mix that

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,000
gets you to deeply decarbonized

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,680
scenarios at the lowest cost and highest

181
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,759
reliability is not 100% nuclear, is not

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,840
100% renewables, is actually a mix of

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
both with a little bit of storage. to

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,639
deal with what we just mentioned a

185
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,280
minute ago sort of the fast changes in

186
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,680
demand and and generation that a nuclear

187
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,440
reactor does not handle very well

188
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
thousand megawatt reactor by the way

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,759
there there's only one solar field on

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,800
the planet I think that's of a scale

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,120
that's comparable to the the capable of

192
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
generating a gawatt of electricity and I

193
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
suspect I don't know where that is but I

194
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
suspect that's probably the capacity is

195
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
not what you get on average it probably

196
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,599
well of course it's off at night

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,840
every single night. So just for scale, I

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
mean a gigawatt nuclear power plant is

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,960
going to provide enough electricity for

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
what 100,000 homes or something like

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,319
that. No, a lot more than that. So a

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,080
gigawatt, of course, it depends on which

203
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
country it is because we all consume

204
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,000
different, you know, uh electricity at

205
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
different rates. But United States where

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,319
we consume a lot of electricity, a

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,319
gigawatt uh reactor or a gigawatt plant

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,360
basically would be enough to power a

209
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,560
city the size of Boston, 750,000

210
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,560
uh people slash househous. homes, right?

211
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
So, so it's a big Yeah. So, it's a it's

212
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,360
a big chunk of power. If you were like,

213
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
you know, king of the world and you were

214
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,720
thinking about the energy mix of

215
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,720
countries and you were saying, "Here's

216
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
what I think is optimal." Now, clearly

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,440
you're a nuclear guy, but I don't know.

218
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,840
Would you say the ideal for the US would

219
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,879
be like 100% nuclear? What what would

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,599
you say? I would say first of all that

221
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,120
it's highly country dependent. Okay. So

222
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,319
there are countries that have natural

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,720
resources either in the form of hydro or

224
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,039
exceptionally good renewables or

225
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,719
plentiful domestic uranium and so it

226
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,000
there really is no one size fits all

227
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,880
right I mean if you look for example

228
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,039
East Asia uh countries with very very

229
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,479
strong industry but zero natural

230
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:46,000
resources and they tend to be very

231
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,399
densely populated and so you know lots

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
of energy needs but not a lot of options

233
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,279
and so what We talked about this Japan

234
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,880
being like this

235
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,720
classic. I was in Taiwan just last week,

236
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,880
right? They have no options. It's a very

237
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,480
very dense uh island. They have very

238
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,839
strong economy with energy hungry

239
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,000
industries and they have no natural

240
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,640
resources. So what are they left with?

241
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,640
Well, they import 98% of their energy at

242
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,839
the moment is imported. Wow. Okay. And

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,399
so it's natural gas, oil, coal, of

244
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,720
course. And uh and so what options do

245
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,640
they have? Well, you can carpet cover

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,480
the whole island with solar and wind.

247
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,399
You won't even get you to where you

248
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
need, but they're doing what they can

249
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,160
with renewables. Uh but at one point,

250
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,399
you got to sort of say, okay, well,

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,000
nuclear is pretty dense. And having

252
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,519
nuclear in a sense makes them more

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
energy independent than they are now

254
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,279
because they have to rely on LNG from

255
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,279
the United States, coal from other

256
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,480
neighbors, Australia. But of course, it

257
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
doesn't make them completely energy

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
independent. No, it doesn't because they

259
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
don't have any uranium. They have No,

260
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
they don't have any uranium. And they

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
actually and they have a domestic

262
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,959
nuclear industry in the sense that they

263
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
have a nuclear operator. They have a

264
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,240
utility that operates nuclear power

265
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,519
plants, but they don't build their own

266
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,519
nuclear plants. And they don't even make

267
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
their own fuel. So even nuclear is now

268
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,640
obviously doesn't give you 100% energy

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,000
security but the energy density of

270
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,320
uranium fuel is so high that if you buy

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
a significant amount you have a lot of

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
energy for a long period of time without

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
having to go back to the market and

274
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
getting a continuous supply of fuel. So

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,320
in that sense is is good. The other

276
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
factor that of course has to be weighted

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
and it's highly country dependent is

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
where you going to get your fuel. Right.

279
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,040
And this has become very evident as a

280
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
problem even in the United States with

281
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,399
the recent Russian embargo. With the

282
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,480
Russian embargo. Exactly. Because we

283
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,680
don't make our own fuel in particular.

284
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
You're talking about nuclear fuel.

285
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,399
Nuclear fuel fuel. So the uranium market

286
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,200
is very mature as a commodity market.

287
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,880
And so the way it has evolved is that

288
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
the countries that produce at the lowest

289
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
cost are the countries that produce the

290
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,279
most. Right? That's it's commodity,

291
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,839
right? At least for uranium. Now,

292
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,079
uranium is not what you put straight in

293
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,000
the core in the reactor. You got to

294
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,000
first enrich it and then you got to

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
fabricate a fuel assembly which is a

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,760
highly engineered system. So there are

297
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
several different steps, but let's just

298
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,519
stay with the raw material with uranium.

299
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,519
If you just look from a geological point

300
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,880
of view, the countries that have the

301
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,279
highest reserves are Australia, Canada,

302
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
the United States actually, Kazakhstan,

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
Namibia, a bunch of other countries.

304
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,800
okay of uranium. This is the okay they

305
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,839
naturally have it but that doesn't mean

306
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,480
that Australia can US are the ones that

307
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
are producing the most because the

308
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
countries that produce the most are the

309
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,040
ones that have the cheapest uranium

310
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,040
right so you may have a lot of uranium

311
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,560
but it doesn't matter if it takes a lot

312
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
of money to extract it okay so at the

313
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,519
moment if you look at the the pie chart

314
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,399
of who is making uranium Kazakhstan is

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,360
actually the the highest uh Australia is

316
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,040
big is big uh you have Russia you have

317
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,959
Namibia but Russia is not a dominant uh

318
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,360
producer of uranium, but it's big enough

319
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,040
that post February 2022 when a lot of

320
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
countries don't want to deal with Russia

321
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
anymore, if you push them out of that

322
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,720
market, that creates a problem. And

323
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,560
that's where the United States is at the

324
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
moment because we were relying

325
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,000
partially, not entirely, but partially

326
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,760
for I think the percentage is something

327
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,680
like 20% or so of our uranium uh on

328
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,120
Russia. And so, and it's not like you

329
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,160
snap your fingers and all of a sudden

330
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,079
you get that 20% replaced overnight. It

331
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,279
takes a certain amount of time. I don't

332
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,040
think it's it's certainly not an

333
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,200
insurmountable problem. It's just a

334
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,079
matter of making the investment and

335
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,480
developing a little bit more resilient

336
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,959
supply chain of uranium for our own

337
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,240
reactor. So, let's can we stay on this

338
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,000
topic of fuel for for a bit? Sure. We

339
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,160
come back to it. I if you want to.

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,680
Sorry, I'm all over the place. But we

341
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,200
were starting so we were going with with

342
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
Taiwan and so on and it and it's true.

343
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
So nuclear is no silver bullet in terms

344
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
of energy independent, right? I I didn't

345
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,440
want to dodge your question of what is

346
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,000
the ideal mix. Oh yeah. So yeah, because

347
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
that's fascinating, right? So indeed,

348
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,959
first of all, let me say it's not one

349
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,720
sizefits-all, right? So each country is

350
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,639
going to have its own. But I go back to

351
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
what I said earlier in the in in the

352
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,920
interview here, and that is let's just

353
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,000
stay on the on the power sector on the

354
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,160
electric markets.

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,440
All the studies that have been done

356
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,600
serious studies show that because of the

357
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
issue of intermittency on one end and

358
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,399
because of the issue of relatively high

359
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,200
cost of nuclear on the other end the

360
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:25,760
ideal mix is neither all intermittent

361
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,600
renewables nor all nuclear. So I would

362
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,600
not recommend 100% nuclear or close to

363
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680
100%. I would absolutely not recommend

364
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,160
close to 100% renewables. is really the

365
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,560
combination of the two plus the storage

366
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,959
that helps you handle the very rapid

367
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,440
variability of of of renewables that

368
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,320
gives you basically the decarbonization

369
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,760
the desired decarbonization deep

370
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,240
decarbonization at the lowest cost and

371
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,880
most likely at the highest reliability.

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,720
So then we can you know not debate but

373
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,920
then we have to analyze country by

374
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,560
country is it in one case 30% nuclear

375
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,040
and 70% renewables or in another case

376
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
might be more nuclear and less

377
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,600
renewables that's going to be country

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
dependent I'm guessing you think in the

379
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,760
US we could have a lot more nuclear we

380
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,279
could certainly have a lot more nuclear

381
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,920
on the grid maybe we'll see uh certainly

382
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,519
I think in other sectors of the economy

383
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,120
jacking up nuclear would make a ton of

384
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,760
sense we already talk about uh for

385
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,839
example heat industry very very

386
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,199
difficult to use renewables for heat

387
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,240
from a technical point of view in a

388
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,839
sense that these are industries that

389
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,600
require heat all the time again you're

390
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,600
you're bumping against the issue of

391
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,279
intermittency but also because from a

392
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,279
thermodynamic point of view if you will

393
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,560
if you're generating electricity which

394
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,720
is what uh PV and uh and wind do then

395
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,320
downgrading it to heat is you know is

396
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
very very inefficient whereas if you

397
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
have a heat source to begin with it's

398
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,720
it's more efficient

399
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,639
So again, it's a wellbalanced mix that

400
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
usually wins wins the game. And we

401
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,800
haven't even talked about well, I just

402
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,880
alluded to reliability, but that's a big

403
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,279
deal. Not just reliability of the system

404
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,600
on a database, also resilience to

405
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,560
disruptions, right? Whether they are

406
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,959
natural disasters or uh man-made events,

407
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,000
you know, terrorism, etc. So, I think

408
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,320
it's uh it's not wise to put all your

409
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,680
eggs in in one basket.

410
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,399
Yakapo, you mentioned that you were in

411
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Taiwan last week and and thinking about

412
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,440
this this great problem they have of of

413
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,639
trying to establish an a domestic energy

414
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,320
supply. And and when you get into those

415
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,440
conversations, I find you end up talking

416
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,199
about this idea of energy independence

417
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,839
as as a virtue and something we should

418
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,680
all be striving for, which I'm not so

419
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,760
convinced about. I mean, to me, it seems

420
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
like we should be thinking about energy

421
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,760
security.

422
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,639
How does that play out in in the nuclear

423
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,760
realm? When you talk about energy

424
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,160
independence, you know, are we are we

425
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,000
meaning here that like the US can just

426
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,440
provide its own energy and like

427
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
whatever? We can have fights with a lot

428
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
of people, but it's okay. We don't need

429
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,480
them. Yeah. The idea sort of originates

430
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,560
in the in the area of oil and gas. Like

431
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,279
we don't have to import oil and gas. We

432
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,839
got our own and it's forever and and

433
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,639
we're stockpiling it. Here we're talking

434
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,199
about, you know, the supply of reliable

435
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,560
energy for industry and the economy.

436
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,880
But it doesn't have to come from within

437
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,480
your own borders. It can come from

438
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,040
outside. It can come from friends. It

439
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,199
can can even come from not friends. You

440
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,199
mentioned Russia being a big supplier

441
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,120
provided there are enough friends out

442
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,360
there to fill the gap if they fall off

443
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,639
in their production. What are the

444
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,079
options in the emerging plants for

445
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,360
making us more energy secure in the

446
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,680
supply of of uranium for those plants

447
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,040
that that we should be thinking about?

448
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,600
Okay. Okay. So, first of all, I agree

449
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,600
with with the way you have set up the

450
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,920
question and the problem here. I think

451
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,759
the goal realistically should not be

452
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,639
energy independence. There are probably

453
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,079
a half a dozen countries that might

454
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,680
theoretically achieve energy

455
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,000
independence. US being blessed one of

456
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,160
one of them. A question I may ask is do

457
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,759
we really want to you know that's is the

458
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,760
what's the what's the big benefit? So, I

459
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,480
I agree with you. energy security and

460
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,160
and given that a lot of these energy

461
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,799
technologies

462
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,360
um have a global supply chain then the

463
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,480
question as you correctly posed it is do

464
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,679
I have enough friendly suppliers out

465
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,760
there so that given a uh potential

466
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,079
scenario I can get the energy that I

467
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,400
need at the cost that I want and so um

468
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,320
in that sense nuclear is not dissimilar

469
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,640
from fossil fuels uh because you do have

470
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,120
a fairly large number of uranium

471
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,480
producers. You have a fairly large

472
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,880
number of uranium enrichers. We'd like

473
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,520
to see a few more. Uh we'd like to see

474
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,120
the US actually rebuild that capability

475
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,440
because yeah, it's not so easy for any

476
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,799
one supplier to ramp up production. It

477
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,600
isn't it isn't it entails it entails

478
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,280
cost and time all feasible and the US

479
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,640
government is taking steps so that the

480
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,520
US is uh going to become again capable

481
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,080
of enriching uranium for its commercial

482
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,760
sector and then there is a uh very

483
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,240
wellestablished and capable supply chain

484
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,760
for fuel fabrication in Europe in Asia

485
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,320
and in the United States. So in that

486
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,799
sense, you know, I'm confident that the

487
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,039
US or any other countries that we would

488
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,720
help to build reactors for, they will

489
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,960
have the fuel that they need in the

490
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,400
longer term. Natural uranium is what is

491
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,360
mined. It's 99 plus% is uranium 238.

492
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,799
That's the isotope 238 of uranium, which

493
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,760
for the purpose of generating energy in

494
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:49,520
traditional reactor designs is not very

495
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,240
useful. and 7% is uranium 235 is the

496
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,400
asotop 235 of uranium and that's sort of

497
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,640
the juicy part of uranium that's what we

498
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
actually use to sustain the cherry

499
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,640
reaction within the core so at the

500
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,600
moment we use less than 1% of the

501
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,679
natural uranium in our current reactors

502
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,480
if we were able to use also the

503
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,039
remaining 99% of course the uranium

504
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,120
resources would immediately multiply

505
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,520
quite dramatically so in the current

506
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,880
design you cannot do that they're just

507
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
laws of physics it's prevented. But

508
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,360
there is a whole class of reactors that

509
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,200
are called fast breather reactors in

510
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,480
which the neutrons are not slowed down

511
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,720
intentionally and you have an excess of

512
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,840
neutrons and you allow for some of these

513
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,559
neutrons to be absorbed by uranium 238

514
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,039
and that uranium 38 turns into plutonium

515
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,440
239 which is also good fuel. And so you

516
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,360
in fact this seems incredible but you

517
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,280
can in these systems you can actually

518
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,039
make more fuel than you're consuming.

519
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,160
That's why they're called breathers. And

520
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,400
so you multiply the amount of fuel uh

521
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,240
quite dramatically. Uh we're not at a

522
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,080
point where this is needed. Uh it

523
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
certainly adds cost and complexity to

524
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,000
the fuel cycle. So at the moment for the

525
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,840
foreseeable future essentially all

526
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,240
countries around the world are going to

527
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,000
stay with the traditional fuel cycle

528
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,600
approach which means we continue to use

529
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,240
about 1% of the natural uranium we mind.

530
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,400
So, so you used the P word plutonium

531
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
there. Uh, um, which made the hair on

532
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,520
the back of my neck stand up quickly

533
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,160
because that's, you know, makes for a

534
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,400
very efficient bombs and and making more

535
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,600
plutonium than you're burning up sort of

536
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
sends you in the direction of the

537
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,480
breeder reactor of making file material

538
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,559
that could be used in weapons. Is that a

539
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,760
problem? And is is that preventing the

540
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,760
proliferation of breeder reactors? It's

541
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,720
always been a concern, right? The way it

542
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,080
works is that you make plutonium 239 in

543
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,000
the fuel that is in the core. But then

544
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,919
in order to do the breeding, you got to

545
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,720
or to to use that plutonium, you got to

546
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,559
reprocess the fuel. Okay? Once the fuel

547
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,039
comes out of the core, you essentially

548
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,880
separate that plutonium 239 from the

549
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,280
rest of the fuel. And depending on how

550
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,440
long it has been in the reactor, that

551
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,960
plutonium could be weapons grade, as you

552
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
said. And so that's always been the

553
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,320
concern that if you go down that path

554
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,480
and you separate plutonium then in

555
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,000
principle you have weapons grade

556
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,799
material and so then it becomes a

557
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,280
proliferation concern. The US decided in

558
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,919
the late '7s that we we're not going to

559
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,840
reprocess our fuel for that reasons to

560
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,440
show sort of you know to set the bright

561
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,880
example and say we you know we don't

562
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,120
want to go down that path because that

563
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,440
could open up the uh the possibility of

564
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,280
proliferation. But the French do the

565
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,000
French have been doing it for 40 years

566
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,080
and uh it's all done under the uh

567
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,400
inspections and monitoring of the IIA.

568
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
So I think it's reasonably well

569
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,000
controlled. But they don't use fast

570
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
breeders really in France. But they do

571
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,240
extract the plutonium, the little amount

572
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,559
of plutonium that comes out of their

573
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,520
traditional reactors, thermal reactors,

574
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:52,440
and they reuse it in the same reactors.

575
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,440
It's called Mox fuel, mix oxide fuel.

576
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,789
[Music]

577
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,600
How much push back do you get in

578
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,440
different countries when it comes to

579
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,600
where do we put this stuff? You know, I

580
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
mean, we've heard a lot of controversy

581
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,480
here like is this going to go in deep

582
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,640
deep inside of a mountain and that seems

583
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,640
tricky in trying to get people to build

584
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,320
more nuclear. So, it comes up in every

585
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,159
conversation, right? So, you have to

586
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,039
make a few points here. First, what do

587
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:27,200
we mean by waste is to spend fuel,

588
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:32,000
right? So, forget about barrels

589
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,679
uh oozing out um green glowing fluids,

590
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,039
radioactive fluids. So, the the waste

591
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,559
for nuclear reactor really looks like

592
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,320
the same fuel assemblies that go into

593
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,000
the reactor when when it's fresh fuel

594
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,919
that you can literally hold in your hand

595
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,880
and you know with with basically zero

596
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,480
radiation. But what has happened when it

597
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
has spent the time in the reactor is

598
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,960
that some of that uranium that uranium

599
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,440
35 that we were talking about as fision

600
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,039
and as a result of that fision process a

601
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,360
lot of radioactivity has been generated.

602
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,440
So it looks the same if I take a picture

603
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
it looks exactly the same it went in. So

604
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,880
it's a highly engineered solid very

605
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,559
robust piece of uh piece of um

606
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,640
technology but it's now highly

607
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,080
radioactive and it and and and it stays

608
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
radioactive for a long period of time.

609
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,919
So, so the first order of business is to

610
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,919
put those fuel assemblies into a span

611
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,440
fuel pool which is colllocated with the

612
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,799
reactor and it stays there for a couple

613
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,159
of years and then and that's just normal

614
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,240
water, right? And that's just water.

615
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,080
Just water, right? So, water happens to

616
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,799
be very good at shielding radiation. So,

617
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,240
you can literally take a tour of these

618
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,600
pen fuel pools and you have your highly

619
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,679
radioactive fuel assemblies just a few

620
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,919
meters underwater. You can look down.

621
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,120
They they have a nice glow blue the

622
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,400
cheranc light. So they look

623
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,159
characteristically radioactive but but

624
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,080
it's perfectly safe. And now

625
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,600
radioactivity naturally decays off. And

626
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
so after a couple of years the

627
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,200
radioactivity level is low enough that

628
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,679
you can pull these fuel assemblies out

629
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,280
of the span fuel pool and put them into

630
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,200
what we call dry casks which are

631
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,000
basically cylindrical canisters made of

632
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,520
steel and concrete. And the

633
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,280
radioactivity is sufficiently low that

634
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
basically the shielding provided by the

635
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,360
steel and the concrete is sufficient so

636
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,080
that if you were to spend an afternoon

637
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,000
turn noon outside is you know in contact

638
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,640
with this dry cask you would get a very

639
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,679
very small amount of radiation minimal

640
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,840
and the volumes and masses are very

641
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,679
small right for all these reactors. Why?

642
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,360
Because the energy density of uranium is

643
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
extraordinarily high. So you don't need

644
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,960
a lot of uranium to produce a lot of

645
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,520
energy to begin with. And because the

646
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
the waste is the spent fuel is the ur is

647
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,640
the the residual material that comes out

648
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,559
of the reactor. You don't have a lot of

649
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,200
it. So help us visualize how much there

650
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,039
is say from the US. Okay. So so you can

651
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,279
you can use a lot of different

652
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,799
analogies. Um, the one that I think is

653
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,200
going to stick the most, I think, with

654
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,840
the with a lay audience, if an

655
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,480
individual were to use only nuclear

656
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,919
energy for his or her energy needs

657
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,159
throughout the lifetime, that you would

658
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,720
produce an amount of spend fuel or waste

659
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,480
that would fit within a coffee cup.

660
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,240
That's it. That would be the amount for

661
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,840
a single person for a single person is a

662
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,279
coffee cup. Now, of course, if you start

663
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,039
producing that energy for millions or

664
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:07,679
billions, it adds up. But how much does

665
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,000
it add up? So in the United States, we

666
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,480
have had a nuclear reactors uh the

667
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,640
nuclear industry for close to maybe 60

668
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,720
years now. At the moment and for the

669
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,120
past 20 plus years has been generating

670
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,840
20% of our electricity. Incidentally,

671
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,679
that translates to roughly 50% of our

672
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,840
lowcarbon electricity. So it's a big

673
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,320
impact on our lowcarbon energy

674
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,799
infrastructure. And the accumulated

675
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,360
waste for 20% of the electricity in

676
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,880
United States from the past 40 or 50

677
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,080
years or whatever it is would basically

678
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,159
fit within a football field uh about 10

679
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,159
mters tall. That's it for the whole

680
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,799
country. That's the amount of high level

681
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,720
waste or spent fuel that we generated.

682
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,960
So again, not a lot of not a lot of

683
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,200
material. But even though as you say

684
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,120
it's not that big, maybe it's not that

685
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,720
dangerous. There still seem to be fights

686
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,320
over people being like, "Yeah, but I

687
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,000
don't want it near me." Oh. Oh,

688
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,720
absolutely. And I think what what it has

689
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,760
to do with is the the way in which the

690
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,960
process to select, license, and

691
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,400
eventually operate a final repository.

692
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,640
The way in which that process has

693
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,559
evolved in the United States has been

694
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,440
characteristically dysfunctional, if I

695
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,080
can put it that way.

696
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,480
And I would say the the story of Yaka

697
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,360
Mountain and the geological repository

698
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,400
for high level nuclear waste is one of

699
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,960
the brightest examples of how

700
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,039
dysfunctional our politics are. Now the

701
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,799
Finns have found a way, right? Yes. Yes.

702
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,279
So so I was going to get to that. Right.

703
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,720
So this is the US, right? And and and

704
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,880
there are other countries that have

705
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,400
followed an equally inefficient and

706
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
dysfunctional process, but there are

707
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,840
also countries that have gotten this

708
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,679
right. And and yeah, you mentioned

709
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,360
Finland is one. these high functioning

710
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,279
northern European countries. Yes. What

711
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,600
are they doing? So the N the Nordics are

712
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,320
doing well in that in that department.

713
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,799
Uh France also which of course uses so

714
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,679
much uh nuclear energy in their energy

715
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,799
mix is not that far behind. And so in

716
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,320
the three countries that I just

717
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,840
mentioned Finland I don't think I

718
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,039
mentioned Sweden but Sweden is the

719
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,640
second and then the third is France. the

720
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,400
process of site

721
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,000
identification, analysis, licensing,

722
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,520
etc. has been a lot healthier in the

723
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,679
United States. And so Finland is going

724
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,679
to be the first country to, you know,

725
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,480
cross the finish line. They have

726
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,240
excavated and it's now built a final

727
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
repository. It's happens to be

728
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,279
colloccated with an existing nuclear

729
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,840
power plant, which I think helps

730
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,840
dramatically also with acceptance and

731
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,279
comfort because these are communities

732
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,880
that have been living with a nuclear

733
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,440
power plant for decades. So they you

734
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,880
know they they their neighbor works at a

735
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,240
nuclear power plant but they they

736
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
themselves work at a nuclear power

737
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,000
plant. So they have developed a level of

738
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,960
comfort and confidence in the technology

739
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,760
and so it's expected to open uh and

740
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,039
start to accept uh that waste next year

741
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,799
or the year after. I think it's next

742
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,200
year actually. Are there any indications

743
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,360
that that will lead

744
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,000
to can I use the word renaissance of

745
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,799
nuclear power in those countries? I mean

746
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,320
Finland if I don't use the the word

747
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,440
renaissance because it was bad luck when

748
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,520
we started using it 15 16 years ago but

749
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,880
in Finland it never stopped in a sense

750
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,200
that it's a country that has been

751
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,799
growing its reliance on nuclear

752
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,559
constantly in spite of being the uh you

753
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,440
know the host of one of the least

754
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,320
successful new build projects the whole

755
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,960
kilow 3 which really took at least twice

756
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,200
as long as it was supposed to and cost a

757
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,279
lot of money. So Finland is another one

758
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,960
of those countries where they made the

759
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,760
decision early on that nuclear would be

760
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,360
part of their mix and they very

761
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,120
deliberately went through a rational

762
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,360
process of approval and uh you know

763
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,919
public acceptance and all of that and as

764
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,000
well uh coming up in parallel with the

765
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,679
solution for the waste etc etc and so

766
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,679
now I forgot what the percentage is but

767
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,120
it's over I think 30% of their

768
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,960
electricity comes from nuclear and they

769
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,640
have appetite for more and a lot of heat

770
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,399
they need too and they need heat for the

771
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,320
for the winter as for the industries.

772
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,679
You know, it's another uh it's a small

773
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,000
country in terms of population, but

774
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,799
they're pretty industryheavy and and

775
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,360
energy hungry in that sense. And so, so

776
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,880
nuclear will grow there. Sweden similar,

777
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,640
right? They went from u relying a lot on

778
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,039
nuclear to actually having at one point

779
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,120
a nuclear phase out policy and then a

780
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,240
couple of years ago, I think the the new

781
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,520
government came in and said, "No, no,

782
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,679
no, we're not going to phase it out. In

783
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,279
fact, we want to rebuild again." And in

784
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,080
parallel with all of this, they had this

785
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,080
process of identifying a site for their

786
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,559
final repository of the waste. And it

787
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,679
was uh wonderful because they actually

788
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,399
had multiple communities that competed

789
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,320
to be the host of this of this site. And

790
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,399
that that speaks volume about their

791
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,399
trust, I think, that people have in

792
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,480
their government and the uh the health

793
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,320
of the uh of the decision- making

794
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,240
process opposed to it's like an Amazon

795
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,399
second headquarters but functional.

796
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,399
Right. So you use that word or the

797
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,880
phrase public trust. I mean how do we

798
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,520
get it back in the US to enable that

799
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,640
sort of progress to I'm not sure that

800
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm this is a question that it goes so

801
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,720
far beyond nuclear. You need like a

802
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,320
couple more degrees and well well but I

803
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,559
guess what I mean is that it's not just

804
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,960
nuclear. I mean everything our public

805
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,440
debate is

806
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,039
so broken at the moment on everything.

807
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
In in fact, I would almost say nuclear

808
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,960
is miraculously one of the few topics on

809
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,640
which at least the two parties seem to

810
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,559
agree that they both want more, right?

811
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,279
They disagree on everything. But when it

812
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,080
comes to tough decisions like where to

813
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,080
put a repository, etc. at the moment to

814
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,399
me seems pretty hopeless in the United

815
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,960
States. Uh and again, nuclear is not the

816
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,480
only example. I was intrigued looking at

817
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,120
the designs of these these northern

818
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,600
European repositories that unlike Yaka

819
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,279
where they made a huge effort to find a

820
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,240
mountain that enabled you to put the

821
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,960
waste underground, but a mountain whose

822
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,279
water table was so far below the

823
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,120
mountain that you were almost guaranteed

824
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,200
that over a very long period of time

825
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,960
water would never enter the the

826
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,440
repository. But but the the Fins put it

827
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,080
below the water table. Well, the geology

828
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,720
matters, right? So the geology in the in

829
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,399
Scandinavia is also very conducive to

830
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,480
this type of repositories because it's

831
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,480
granite has very low porocity, very low

832
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,520
mobility. But we we don't have a

833
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,039
shortage of great Yeah. sites. It

834
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,640
doesn't take a Yakamount. No, it doesn't

835
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,240
take a Yakamount. Yeah. But you know the

836
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
history of Yakamount, it was chosen not

837
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,000
because of its good geology. It was

838
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,760
chosen for political reasons. At that

839
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,480
time, you know, in the Senate, the state

840
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,480
of Nevada was not well was not

841
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,000
represented very seniorly, so to speak.

842
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,080
And so they, you know, they pulled the

843
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,120
shortest straw. I suppose it doesn't

844
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,640
help that Nevada is one of uh several

845
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,840
states that doesn't actually benefit

846
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,320
from nuclear energy because they don't

847
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,000
have nuclear reactors, right? So in a

848
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,799
sense, you can see why the initial

849
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,399
conditions were bad, right? So it would

850
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,720
make a lot of sense to find a site in

851
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,080
Illinois or Tennessee or North Carolina

852
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,480
because those are states that rely

853
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,159
heavily on nuclear. So they would also

854
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,519
see the point of taking care of the

855
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,360
waste. I think for many people when you

856
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,720
talk about

857
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,840
nuclear the sort of elephant in the room

858
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,519
is always Chernobyl, Fukushima through

859
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,919
my island. How do you talk to people or

860
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,600
to politicians who are trying to talk to

861
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,120
their own constituents about like we're

862
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,640
going to be able to build a nuclear

863
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,000
power plant but avoid these mistakes?

864
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,240
How do you how do you sort of deal with

865
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
people's knowledge and fear? Right.

866
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,519
Right. Right. Well, the the the first

867
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,360
point I usually make is that the

868
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,440
technology evolves, right? So, it's a

869
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,039
little bit like uh cars, right? They've

870
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,480
been around for the longest time, but if

871
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,440
you're buying a car now, you're not

872
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,679
buying a German Trabent from the 1970s.

873
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,919
You're probably buying a Mercedes latest

874
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,799
model and it has safety belts and it's

875
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,519
got a whole bunch of sensors and and and

876
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,679
uh and and safety uh safety features

877
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,760
that make it a lot more reliable and

878
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,440
safe than than the old models. The same

879
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,120
is good is true for nuclear. The

880
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,039
difference though is that a lot of our

881
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,919
reactors in operation now were built

882
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,600
back in the 70s and the 80s, but they've

883
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,559
been retrofitted. They've been upgraded.

884
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,399
I mean, this is an the fact that the

885
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,840
machine or the plant has been there for

886
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,080
several decades doesn't mean that it's

887
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
the same plant than when it was built.

888
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,760
And not to put a positive spins on

889
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,519
accidents and accidents were were

890
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,760
painful, certainly damaged the

891
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,760
reputation and and economically the

892
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,200
industry. A big deal. uh but each

893
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,919
accident objectively has been also a

894
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,159
learning experience and uh the um

895
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,600
reliability and safety of the plants

896
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,440
around the world not just in the

897
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,279
countries that experienced the accidents

898
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,519
have improved as a result of the

899
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,799
accident. Lots of lessons learned for

900
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,200
all three of them. You mentioned Three

901
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,120
Mile Island, uh, Chernobyl, Fukushima. I

902
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
would say the one that is maybe least

903
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,480
interesting, but at the same time most

904
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,559
spectacular is Chernobyl. And I say

905
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,559
least interesting because it happened

906
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:57,519
for a technology and for a cultural

907
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,840
context that are so in many ways

908
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,919
irrelevant to to our own that it's hard

909
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,080
to draw a lot of lessons other than very

910
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,840
high level about you know the arrogance

911
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,679
of human beings thinking that they can

912
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
do whatever they want and not paying any

913
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,159
price for it. But the two accidents are

914
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,040
have been a lot more interesting and

915
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,079
consequential for the industry on a on a

916
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,919
world scale were three mile island which

917
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,839
was a serious accident because the uh

918
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,679
you know they had partial meltdown of

919
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,119
the core and that particular reactor

920
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
never operated again but at the same

921
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,760
time also show that the uh safety

922
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,760
structures that are built into these

923
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,119
reactors are very robust because that

924
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,720
was a serious accident but there was

925
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,560
essentially no release or activity. the

926
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,960
containment structure function perfectly

927
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,000
well and then Fukushima which is a lot

928
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,960
more recent again technology 2011 right

929
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,200
2011 in that case also good lessons

930
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,359
learned about the importance of what we

931
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,520
call external events things like you

932
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,359
know earthquake and tsunami beyond

933
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,760
design basis this is all jargon but what

934
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,079
that means is that you thought that you

935
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,240
know the maximum credible accident that

936
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,880
you can have at this site would be x but

937
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,400
in fact mother nature gave you x plus

938
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,920
20% how do you cope with that, right?

939
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,680
Because you can overengineer and

940
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,520
overbuild, etc., etc., but at one point

941
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,800
you got to draw a line otherwise you

942
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,000
never going to use these machines

943
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,599
because they become too expensive,

944
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,599
right? So then you have to be more

945
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,119
clever. You have to have a way to assess

946
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
what is the probability that these

947
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,160
things happen. But also if they do

948
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,079
happen, you have to have more robust

949
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,440
mitigation measures in place. Okay. So

950
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,960
all of this has been has been good

951
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,640
learning experience and particularly

952
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,800
after Fukushima I would say because it's

953
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,599
so recent and the industry on a global

954
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,200
scale is so well integrated uh uh the

955
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,040
lessons learned have percolated

956
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,880
really across the whole fleet worldwide.

957
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,720
So like Fukushima made every nuclear

958
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,720
plant get better. Absolutely. Okay.

959
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,359
Absolutely. So indications are as far as

960
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,760
I know that you know young people are

961
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,119
more positive about nuclear energy than

962
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,119
older people like say us me who

963
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,320
experienced Fukushima and tmi and

964
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,160
Chernobyl. Is that is that something

965
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,480
you're seeing and does it make you feel

966
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,240
optimistic about the future of nuclear

967
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,960
power here? Yeah, we we see it I think

968
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,560
it's again very much country dependent.

969
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,240
There are some interesting interesting

970
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,160
studies here that look at the

971
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,800
demographics within different countries.

972
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,680
they look even at political orientation,

973
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,839
gender, everything matters and in

974
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,720
different ways etc. But if you look at

975
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,280
sort of averages uh in the US the at the

976
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,119
moment it's uh the support for nuclear

977
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,960
let me call it generic support for

978
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,920
nuclear is an all-time high. I mean

979
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,800
you're looking at mid 70%. Which is

980
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,000
really really stellar. Now I you know

981
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,920
and I I you think okay well I'm here and

982
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,400
let's open a bottle of champagne right

983
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,640
that's great people love nuclear uh I

984
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,960
tend to be not skeptical but I tend not

985
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,320
to over um estimate that uh because

986
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,560
there is a difference in my opinion

987
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,079
between generic support and specific

988
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,800
support and I'm going to elaborate on

989
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,040
that generic support is at a time of

990
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,119
crisis particular when uh energy prices

991
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,599
are high or there is a perception that

992
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,320
energy secure the energy supply may not

993
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,480
be as secure. Um, all energy

994
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,680
technologies sound good, you know, like,

995
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,920
um, hey, energy cost a lot of money and

996
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,359
I don't know if I have enough. Can

997
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,960
nuclear provide it? Why not? You know,

998
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,680
like so it's good. Um, and that's great

999
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,320
and and the same is true for renewables

1000
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,000
skyrocket. you know, 90% plus we lost

1001
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,000
solar and wind. But there is a

1002
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,359
difference between that kind of support

1003
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,800
and then hey in your town in your county

1004
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,960
next door we're going to put a new

1005
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,560
corrector or or a wind farm. I was going

1006
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,320
to say same with windmills, right? I

1007
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,880
think people are generically for it but

1008
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,160
against it in their town. I mean look at

1009
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,520
all the issues we're having here in New

1010
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,480
England, right? It' be lovely to bring

1011
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,720
in some hydro power from Quebec but you

1012
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,320
got to, you know, put those transmission

1013
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,359
lines through New Hampshire and Vermont.

1014
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,280
They don't want it. So, so then nimism

1015
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,800
comes in right not in my backyard and

1016
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,119
that's an issue and is that a huge

1017
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,760
problem you think in the US and so for

1018
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,280
for nuclear green field possibly

1019
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,359
although not a lot of people are

1020
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,640
proposing green field for brownfield

1021
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,240
which means adding nuclear reactors to

1022
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,560
sites that already have nuclear power

1023
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,400
plants has not been an issue at all and

1024
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,280
green field I guess would just mean like

1025
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,880
putting it in a field somewhere like no

1026
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,359
it simply means a site that has no

1027
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,839
history of of nuclear energy a new

1028
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,920
place. A new place. If you if you try to

1029
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,520
put it at existing nuclear power plant

1030
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,920
sites is is uh we have not seen any any

1031
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,079
real opposition. In fact, typically the

1032
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,800
locals will love it. They want more

1033
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,200
because again I think you develop a

1034
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,440
comfort and confidence in the technology

1035
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,200
by simply living in those areas. And

1036
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
it's not just that it's also the

1037
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,119
economic benefit which are very

1038
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,680
substantial. You know they they pay the

1039
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,400
the plant pays a lot of local taxes. It

1040
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,040
pays for a lot of well-paid jobs, right?

1041
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,480
It creates a lot of well-paid jobs. So,

1042
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,320
there are a few plants that were shut

1043
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,240
down. You say at the beginning, the

1044
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,800
fleet is shrinking. In the US, for a

1045
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,800
while, it was slowly shrinking. You

1046
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,200
know, maybe a dozen reactors that maybe

1047
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,800
less than a dozen that were shut down.

1048
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,800
Some for economic reasons, others

1049
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,400
because of botched component

1050
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,880
replacement, etc. But they were they

1051
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,440
shut down and and we saw two clear

1052
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,440
effects every time. One, environmentally

1053
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,960
emissions always went up in that state,

1054
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,480
right? You shut down a nuclear power

1055
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,920
plant, there is this naive expectation,

1056
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,839
oh, we're going to replace with solar.

1057
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,960
Well, yes, in principle, you could

1058
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,240
replace with solar and wind. In

1059
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,599
practice, you're replacing with a little

1060
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,680
bit of solar and wind and a lot of

1061
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,240
natural gas. And so, the emissions go

1062
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,119
up. Uh but number two importantly the

1063
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,200
counties and towns where these reactors

1064
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,800
or these power power plant were uh were

1065
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,119
operating they went through very very

1066
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,720
rough times uh economically speaking

1067
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,800
because again these are big sort of

1068
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,040
engines economic engines for the local

1069
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,280
economy. So we've got tremendous

1070
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,200
operating record. We've got new designs

1071
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,240
coming online, different scales of

1072
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,240
reactors that can fit into applications,

1073
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,320
reactors that might not require these

1074
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,040
external infrastructures, make them

1075
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,839
easier to install. I'm even beginning to

1076
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,880
feel optimistic about nuclear. I mean,

1077
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,040
when when you look out 10, 20 years, are

1078
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,640
are you seeing a lot of nuclear power

1079
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,960
globally and in the United States in

1080
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,119
particular? So at the moment in terms of

1081
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,839
general support and policies at the

1082
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,760
government level in

1083
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,839
media, NOS's, environmental

1084
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,760
organizations that is probably an

1085
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,440
all-time high. I never seen so much

1086
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,079
support for nuclear. So that's all good,

1087
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,960
right? Is that automatically going to

1088
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,920
translate into a uh you know impetuous

1089
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,359
growth of nuclear in the US or on a

1090
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,680
global scale? Not necessarily. And the

1091
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,200
reason for that is twofold. We talked a

1092
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,200
lot about economics and a lot about

1093
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,359
cost. Unless the industry, particularly

1094
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,839
in the US and Western Europe, can bring

1095
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,520
down the cost of new construction, I

1096
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,839
don't see this technology being adopted

1097
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,920
widely. And number two, unless they

1098
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,560
diversify a little bit their mindset,

1099
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,480
it's not just about the power grid. The

1100
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,400
grid is fundamentally a commodity

1101
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,040
market. There's not a lot of money to be

1102
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,319
made there. If they on the other end

1103
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,680
they go more decisively for um markets

1104
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,280
in which nuclear energy is valued more

1105
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,200
because of its attributes because it

1106
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,040
generate because it produces as we said

1107
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,440
over and over again not just electricity

1108
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,480
but heat and electricity so you got

1109
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,319
co-generation because it's carbon free

1110
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,640
because of reliable etc. Unless you can

1111
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,040
monetize a little bit more of those

1112
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,839
features, I also don't see it growing

1113
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,599
much. So, um, so we'll see. And a lot of

1114
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,119
this is in the hands, frankly, of the

1115
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,040
industry. They got to sort of pull their

1116
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,520
act together. Very good, as we said, in

1117
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,000
Asia, nuclear industry, very good there.

1118
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,319
In the US, very, very good at running

1119
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,960
the plants, right? The industry here

1120
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,040
runs the existing plants exceptionally

1121
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,440
well. The capacity factors are through

1122
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,760
the roof, very efficient, very safe,

1123
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,440
very reliably. But building new ones,

1124
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,839
the record doesn't show that they're

1125
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,599
very good. So, and they got to become

1126
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,240
good because growth means you got to

1127
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,400
build new plants. So, at the moment,

1128
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,920
we're in sort of that potential

1129
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,319
inflection point. It could go up, it

1130
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,720
could go down, it could stay the same.

1131
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,359
Very hard to tell. I'm also optimistic

1132
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,880
cuz I'm by nature optimistic, but there

1133
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:25,040
are still big big uncertainties there.

1134
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,800
Yakapo Bonjouro is a professor in the

1135
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,640
department of nuclear engineering at

1136
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,319
MIT. Thanks for being here. Yeah,

1137
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,390
