00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
we all like to say that chemistry is the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,839
central science and it is the central

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
science in fact what I'd like to say

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,240
it's the science of the familiar because

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,480
everything around us is made of

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,120
chemicals the air that we breathe is a

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,599
mixture of usually good chemicals the

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,199
food that we eat is a mixture of

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,080
chemicals the clothes that we wear are

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,160
made of chemicals our own bodies are

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,359
made of chemicals the drugs that some

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,480
people very stupidly experiment with are

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,720
chemicals ah some of you are smiling I'm

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,720
connecting with you already so complex

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,199
but it's beautiful beauty is part of

16
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,399
science science it's an essential part

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,079
of science I'd like to ask each one of

18
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,120
you right now to reach out and touch a

19
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,440
chemical go ahead and do it right now

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,879
somebody's tapping on somebody's

21
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,480
shoulder somebody's pulling somebody's

22
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,480
hair don't pull too long somebody's

23
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,600
reaching out in the air yes chemicals

24
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,399
are all around us and we want to learn

25
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,160
and enjoy the beautiful chemical world

26
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,079
that we live in that's why I say

27
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,440
chemistry is the science of the familiar

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,120
