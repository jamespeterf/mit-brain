1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,600
next thing I want to do now that we have

2
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,840
fear CH so now what do we know we have

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,480
this protocol again I'm always think of

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,760
this protocol as parall repetition

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,279
parallel repeated and we know the sound

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,640
on it now what's really nice about it

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,720
that this gives us so now I wanted to

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,360
say two things in the hour or so

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,760
remaining one thing I want to say is

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,719
that it gives us an isic okay

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,039
non-interactive a zero knowledge uh

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,559
proof and the second and so I want to

13
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,440
explain what that is and the second

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,600
thing I want to say is uh to mention a

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,399
little bit what was me the question uh

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,000
here in the beginning which was wait

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
this contradicts all this idea with

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,239
something weird is going on so I want to

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,920
talk about that and I want to end with

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,879
explaining why this technique is more

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,439
General okay

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:09,400
H okay so let's first see why

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,400
why why we get an isic okay

24
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
so okay so now what did we get Once once

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,960
we apply the fum we have an

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,240
uninteractive protocol so let's look at

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,920
this protocol and

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:28,600
see what this protocol becomes when we

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,600
apply the F Paradigm to it

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
so let me just write it down Actually I

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,040
don't even want to write the

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,799
explicit

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,799
uh constru like everything explicitly

34
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,320
let me just say this protocol had like a

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,119
public key associated with

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:52,439
it now it also has a a hash function

37
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,399
associated with hash key which we use

38
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,799
for the fure hash function and now

39
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,560
essentially the

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,600
verifier he sends Alpha which is the

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,399
other commitments FAL repetition like

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,640
the first message and then he tells you

43
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,880
beta he doesn't need to send it

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,239
everybody comput it but that's kind of

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,040
evaluating with a hash key Alpha by the

46
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,319
way I abuse notation a little bit and

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,040
actually every time you don't you

48
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,160
you uh let's see there's also a g here

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,080
like the instance the

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,640
graph really what you where you hash is

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,000
the graph in Alpha I kind of omitted the

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,800
graph from the notation because it's

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,400
kind of cumbersome and it's kind of

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,920
fixed in advance the alpha is the one

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,519
that's not fixed so I the G but the G is

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,519
always there when you apply F you apply

57
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,480
it to the first message and the

58
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,879
instance okay so that's the beta and

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,200
gamma this is the pro that's the it's

60
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,959
one message right because we applied F

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,080
okay so this protocol which consists of

62
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,239
three messages Alpha Beta gamma now once

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,560
we applied F we have not only the public

64
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,599
key in the CRS we also have the hash key

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,560
corresponding to the fiir

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,840
and now this Alpha Beta gamma are sent

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,440
all at once there's no interaction

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,680
that's what F

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,400
does but beta the PR's hands are tied

70
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,560
and they it should be the evaluation of

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,599
G and Alpha the hash function evaluated

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,480
on G and Alpha so this is completely

73
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,680
noninteractive and it's sound because we

74
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,120
just worked hard to prove that it's

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,760
sound if we use this hash

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,680
function under Circle Circ yeah is

77
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,439
this a isic argument now then because we

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,280
used like f SEC good a we'll see there's

79
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,040
you can make it and is a proof or

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,760
argument so we'll talk about that in a

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,519
second but uh so this is a one message

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,480
it's sound and it's complete now what

83
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,239
happened to the zero knowledge let's see

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,519
what happened here we said we had zero

85
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,480
knowledge we could simulate

86
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,120
it what happens

87
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,640
here and what I want to argue is that

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,840
it's still you have zero knowledge even

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,120
though before we said f actually Ru zero

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,400
knowledge supp it's not zero

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,959
knowledge this non intractive version

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,840
you can can prove that it's zero

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,239
knowledge however the definition of zero

94
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,000
knowledge here is a different bit

95
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,560
different because we have a common

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,880
random string so now this common random

97
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,080
or common reference string denoted by

98
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,880
CRS it consists of the public

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,759
key used for the commitment for the

100
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,320
message Alpha

101
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,720
and the hash use for the

102
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,360
CRS now let me I want to argue that this

103
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,960
protocol is a non-interactive zero

104
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,400
knowledge or is an isic non-interactive

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
zero

106
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,840
knowledge but to prove that let me

107
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,639
Define first what noninteractive zero

108
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,800
knowledge is okay because it's the

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,400
definition is similar to the interactive

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,919
setting but slightly different so the

111
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,280
definition is the following anic for a

112
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:06,560
language out

113
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,400
is the following it says that for any PP

114
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,800
VAR or poly size it can be non it can be

115
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,639
poly but okay me for any PPT V

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,680
Star there exists a simulator a PPT

117
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,800
simulator po time

118
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,199
simulator such that the simulator can

119
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,960
simulate everything that the verifier

120
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,800
learns in the real world so what does

121
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,759
the What is the view of the verifier in

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,520
the real world such that the view of the

123
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,360
verifier in the real world which is what

124
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,240
it's the

125
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,919
CRS so every niic is a it's not

126
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,720
interactive and there's a CRS so the

127
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,960
verifier learns the CRS and he learns

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,840
what he got he learns uh H such that

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,840
sorry for every X and L I forgot to say

130
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,199
for every X in the language he learns

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,960
this and he learns the proof of the

132
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,720
actual prover so I guess what the actual

133
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,199
prover gives is when he gets

134
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,639
CRS X and

135
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,319
witness this is what the verifier learns

136
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,639
in the real world he sees the CRS and he

137
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,840
sees the actual proof produced by the

138
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,039
prover and the prover is given CRS X and

139
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,440
A Witness instance and

140
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:25,360
witness and zero knowledge says that the

141
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,240
simulator can simulate this so I forgot

142
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,560
to say security parameter there's also

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,520
security param oh actually you know what

144
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,759
you don't need security parameter

145
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
because the CRS you can think of

146
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,599
including in this

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,400
includes also security parameter you can

148
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:46,080
always assume the CRS includes a

149
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,880
security parameter so here what the

150
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
verifier learns in the real world he

151
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,919
sees the CRS which includes a security

152
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,960
parameter and he sees the proof that the

153
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,120
verifier gave and now I want to argue

154
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,240
that the simulator can simulate this

155
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,240
entire thing

156
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,240
okay typically we also allow auxiliary

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,440
information so for any ax and for every

158
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,240
auxiliary information

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,400
augs

160
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,120
a the Dy also see sees augs and still he

161
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,120
cannot tell the

162
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,479
difference so when we talk about Zer

163
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,240
there's just Zer and then there's

164
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,639
auxiliary input Zer knowledge this is

165
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,000
stronger we usually want this so I'm

166
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,360
just writing it but uh there's also the

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,080
without auxilary information uh

168
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,120
definition but again what is zero uh NK

169
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,960
non interactive zero knowledge it says

170
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,960
that for any efficient

171
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,039
varar there exists an efficient

172
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,639
simulator said that for every X in the

173
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,879
language that had a witness and for any

174
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,199
auxiliary information that the you know

175
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,960
the simulator may have or the verifier

176
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,440
may

177
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,840
have what the verifier learns in the

178
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,039
real world can be simulated by the

179
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,520
simulator

180
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:06,759
yeah here we don't even need

181
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,840
right yeah sorry there's no

182
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,199
v ah yeah there's no V whatever you can

183
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,039
learn you're right thank you for every L

184
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,840
there exist a simulator for every X for

185
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:22,479
any auxilary that's it that's the

186
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,960
definition okay cuz V doesn't send

187
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:29,759
anything okay now here's note what what

188
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,680
the reason this is still zero knowledge

189
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,399
is

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,080
that now the simulator he gets to choose

191
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,640
the

192
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,800
CRS the simulator he outputs this

193
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,080
simulator outputs a CRS and some fake

194
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,640
proof P that should be

195
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,640
indistinguishable even given

196
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:00,120
augs so really it's

197
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,440
um a and the point is the simulator he

198
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,279
can he can he has the power to choose

199
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,320
the CRS this is a power that the

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,480
cheating prover does not

201
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,399
have and that's

202
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,880
why if you could prove that Fe the the

203
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,519
fact that F works for the fact that you

204
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,440
have a it's it doesn't there's no

205
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,040
contradiction with the fact that it's

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,720
zero knowledge and F chir sound because

207
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,959
the fact that it's zero knowled the fact

208
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,600
that it's F chir sound

209
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,680
or in other words the fact that it's

210
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
zero

211
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,800
knowledge does not mean that you can use

212
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,240
the simulator as a cheating prover the

213
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,560
simulator succeeds in simulating because

214
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,680
he has the power to fake the CRS the

215
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,959
cheating Pro does not have that

216
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,760
power okay again remember before we said

217
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,680
oh if you have fear then the simulator

218
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,680
because he can

219
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,040
simulate uh the view he can he can also

220
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,880
simulate a view in the case of cheating

221
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,399
so he can actually break Fe here he

222
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,720
can't break F because I mean the prover

223
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,920
can't the simulator can because he has

224
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
an additional power that a cheating

225
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,760
prover does not have he can fake the

226
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
he's the one who gets to choose the CRS

227
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,040
and that's the only reason why we can

228
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,519
actually get ank here because he's we're

229
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,120
gonna he's going to choose the CRS to

230
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,040
his liking in an indistinguishable way

231
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,920
of

232
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,720
course but I mean this CRS and This Ss

233
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,720
are

234
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,680
indistinguishable but he can kind of

235
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,920
program it that's that's the idea

236
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,880
so let me just tell you why it's zero

237
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,959
knowledge and then you'll see because

238
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,240
you know why it's F secure I'll tell you

239
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
why it's Z knowledge and then you'll see

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,839
how I'm where how I'm abusing the power

241
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,760
of the

242
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,839
simulator

243
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,079
okay so the way the reason why it's uh

244
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,000
Zer it's NK it's nonactive zeron so I

245
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,320
need to come up with a simulator I need

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,639
to simulate the F

247
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,480
protocol and actually if you think about

248
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,560
it how can I simulate it I need to come

249
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,279
up with an think what I need to do I'm

250
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,519
the simulator it seems like a hard task

251
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,959
for me what do I need to do as a

252
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,519
simulator so what does the Sim do Sim

253
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,320
needs to he he needs to generate CRS

254
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,560
somehow I don't know okay I can just

255
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,040
generate publicly and hash key but

256
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:25,320
then I need to find like Alpha Beta

257
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:29,519
gamma accepting so I guess first note

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,720
look the simulator is given oh wait he's

259
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,360
given also X forgot to write X he's

260
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,000
given the instance X and

261
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,480
augs now note I'm the Simulator X can be

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,240
in the language X cannot be in the

263
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,680
language I have no idea what x

264
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,440
is okay so in if I if I succeed I should

265
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,240
also succeed for some for some x's not

266
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,480
in the language because I I can't break

267
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,399
the language now if to succeed for X9 in

268
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,399
the language I need to generate beta

269
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,880
that's bad otherwise I can't

270
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,560
succeed but how can I generate B bet

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,920
that's bad I remember the encryption H

272
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,120
it's a problem the reason it's not a

273
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,440
problem because I'm going to break the

274
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,440
encryption I get to choose it I choose

275
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,480
the encryption I chose it with a secret

276
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,360
key and actually actually let me be a

277
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,399
um actually for this specific hash

278
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
function I actually don't know how to

279
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,760
prove that it's an isic it may be I

280
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,839
don't know but I don't know how to prove

281
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,560
it but if you slightly change that hash

282
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,000
function in a way that doesn't affect

283
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,040
soundness at all then I can prove that

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,680
it's AIC so I'm going to slightly change

285
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,120
the hash function the F hash function

286
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,880
okay I'm going to slightly change it

287
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,240
just add a constant to

288
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,920
it I'm going to argue that it doesn't

289
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,320
change the uh soundness and uh but now I

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,560
can use it for niic so let me show you

291
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,120
how this is

292
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,680
done so how do I generate this Alpha

293
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,880
Beta gamma so the first thing I'm going

294
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,880
to do I'm going to you know what I'm

295
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,880
going to just generate beta completely

296
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,880
random okay so I'm going to actually use

297
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,120
kind of a the way remember last time we

298
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,880
showed why the

299
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,160
single um uh the the one bit protocol is

300
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,120
zero knowledge I'm going to use that

301
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,480
that idea or in other words I'm going to

302
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:25,320
first use a simulator first I'm going to

303
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:29,800
use a honest verifier ZK simulator this

304
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,800
is just short for honest verifier

305
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,920
so I'm going to use a simul I want to

306
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,480
First argue this protocol alpab beta

307
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,160
gamma even repeat it in parallel repeat

308
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,600
it in parallel right so it's honest

309
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,240
verifi your knowledge what does it mean

310
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,480
honest verifier the verifier just sends

311
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,839
beta completely and random so B1 B2 up

312
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,320
to B Lambda completely

313
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
randomly then it's zero

314
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,519
knowledge okay so that we kind of saw

315
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,880
last time so first of all I want to

316
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,800
argue that we have honest verifier of

317
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,360
zero knowledge that's the first thing H

318
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,079
the interactive protocol the interactive

319
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,959
but parel repeated okay the interactive

320
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,920
par repeated protocol is onest verifier

321
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,639
zero

322
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,959
knowledge

323
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,920
why well it's very easy what I'm going

324
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,560
to do I'm the simulator what I'm going

325
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,839
to do I'm going to first I need to

326
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,320
generate a transcript what I'm going to

327
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,040
do I'm going to first generate it

328
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,160
generate the B's B1 B2 up to B Lambda at

329
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,880
random now I know what I'm now I know

330
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,120
okay if B equals zero I'm going to just

331
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,600
commit to uh I'm going to commit here

332
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,920
just a completely random hamiltonian

333
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,440
cycle have nothing to do with the graph

334
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,360
if I need to open if B was one I'm going

335
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,839
to just really commit to Pi of G won't

336
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,440
have any antonian cycle in it but I'm

337
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,399
going to commit the pi

338
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,720
ofg so that's going to be my simulation

339
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,000
okay we it's kind of a little bit of

340
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,600
what we did it's similar to what we did

341
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,440
last time but it's even easier because

342
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,839
the verifire is completely honest

343
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,959
okay and let me repeat it how do I

344
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,079
generate this transcript repeated Lambda

345
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,639
times in parallel I need to generate

346
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,600
Alpha Beta gamma that looks like real

347
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm going to first generate the beta so

348
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,199
B one of to B Lambda that's the first

349
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,519
thing then I'm going to generate Alpha

350
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,639
I'm gonna take it out of order how do I

351
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
generate Alpha well if the B

352
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,880
corresponding to the let's say how the

353
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,680
first Alpha if the B was Zero I know I

354
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,920
need to open to the hamiltonian cycle

355
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,839
I'll I'll I'll commit down random aonian

356
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,839
cycle if the bit B was one I know that I

357
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,399
will need to open the pi and the

358
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,360
non-edges then I'll just commit to Pi G

359
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,399
honestly there's not going to be a homon

360
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,759
cycle in there but I know I'm not going

361
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,000
to be asked to open it and that's what I

362
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,839
do bit by

363
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
bit so because I know beta I choose

364
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:53,120
Alpha to be kind of I exactly choose

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,440
Alpha to hit the bad on

366
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,720
purpose okay so that's I I so I I can

367
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,600
choose Alpha so I can choose Alpha Beta

368
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,279
G

369
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,519
to hit the bad but now what do I do with

370
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,880
the hash function how do I I didn't

371
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,199
choose the hash function yet remember

372
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,680
now I'm going to choose the hash

373
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:14,040
function so now I want to be able now I

374
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,040
want to

375
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:23,360
choose hash key such that you know eval

376
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:25,399
the hash key and Alpha actually an G of

377
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,959
alpha but I'm going to Adit G for

378
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,920
Simplicity is equal to that beta which

379
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,920
is the bad beta

380
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,399
how can I do this is it so can I choose

381
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,399
hash key subject to

382
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,319
this I I can choose the public key the

383
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:46,240
secret key everything you know I can

384
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:48,519
break the encryption but can I choose it

385
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,120
subject to so actually to tell you the

386
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,240
truth I don't really know if you can do

387
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,399
it but let me change slightly the hash

388
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,000
function and now I'll be able to do that

389
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,440
how do I change the hash

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,240
function my hash function

391
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,160
it's going to be the original hash

392
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,520
function plus some fixed kind of Lambda

393
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,240
so the hash function outputs some string

394
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,799
0 one to the Lambda small Lambda I'm

395
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,839
going to just add a random completely

396
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,199
random Lambda bit string to it ah now I

397
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,959
don't like this letter because it

398
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:30,080
sound I'm going to add Z in 0 one to the

399
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,840
Lambda a random Lambda bit string

400
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,160
now now I'm in business that's easy now

401
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:39,400
because now I want to make sure that

402
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,880
okay so now I need this to be equal to

403
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,480
Beta no problem I'll choose hash key

404
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,080
honestly I'll compute this and I'll just

405
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,440
in in the CRS so I told you how I

406
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,000
simulate Alpha Beta gamma now I need to

407
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,159
simulate the CRS what does the CRS

408
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,240
consists of it consists of the public

409
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,600
key and the hash key I'll choose the

410
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,360
public key randomly now the hash key

411
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,880
consists of of this part and this part

412
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
it's like now two hash keys because it's

413
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,400
the original hash keys but I also add a

414
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,760
fixed Z to it that's my new hash key

415
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,039
okay my new hash

416
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,799
function does the previous hash function

417
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,720
and adds z z is fixed it's part of the

418
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,320
description of the hash

419
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:25,000
function so now how do I generate the

420
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,880
CRS so for CRS so to generate a CRS I'm

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,480
going to choose a random public key a

422
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,880
random hash key

423
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,760
and Z such that this equation is

424
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,200
satisfied I'm going to choose Z which is

425
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,159
equal to I chose Alpha Beta gamma I

426
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,520
chose the I chose already Hashi so this

427
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:46,520
defines this the the eval so Z is just

428
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,520
going to be beta minus or xor I'm in I'm

429
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,520
over strings so xor this

430
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,679
Evan and this is a good simulation

431
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,120
so now let me go back to your question

432
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,080
which

433
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,919
was so okay so the question was so this

434
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,799
is going to be it's zero knowledge it's

435
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,039
computational zero knowledge it's not

436
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,280
statistical zero knowledge because the

437
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,880
alpha contains actually the when I

438
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,880
simulate it I don't simulate it with a

439
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,720
real Pi of c i simulate it with junk so

440
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,840
it's only computational zero knowledge

441
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,559
but it's statistical um and it's not

442
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,840
even statistical soundness because I'm

443
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,600
using FH so I don't I I don't get

444
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,200
anything computation is zero knowledge

445
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,200
and computational

446
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,679
soundness there is a way to get

447
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,280
statistical if you play with it but this

448
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,480
the way I I explained it it's everything

449
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,480
is

450
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
computational

451
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,760
yeah the final

452
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:07,720
key is the and then you have that random

453
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,520
but in real case it will be just good

454
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,440
good good great great great question so

455
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,159
you're saying you're saying wait so I

456
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
changed the I changed the hash key on

457
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,960
you so before

458
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:23,159
a let me erase

459
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,559
this before the hash key was exactly

460
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,880
what we wrote there that was the hash

461
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,640
key now I changed the hash key now the

462
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,640
hash key is

463
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,760
what tell me first now the hatch key is

464
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,039
going to be

465
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,039
this and

466
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,159
z h a random Z so the has key consists

467
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,720
of the

468
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,320
a public encrypt FH public key publicy

469
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,120
for fully homic encryption an encryption

470
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,880
of a g that's in the analysis going to

471
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,760
be okay in the analysis we're going to

472
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,679
see what it's now changing a little

473
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,280
because it's the Z but some G of fixed

474
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:10,039
size like uh 0 to the T okay and a

475
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,559
random Z and 01 to the Lambda that's it

476
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:17,760
now I still want to argue I still want

477
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,840
to argue that that um a that this G is

478
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,000
not bad right I want to argue that I

479
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,679
want to say that uh when I en when I do

480
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,480
the for every Alpha when I do this fom

481
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,760
morphic encryption it's it's not bad so

482
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,279
for which G for which G Star when I do

483
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,240
this so now okay now what I want to

484
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,279
argue let me change this a little bit I

485
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,600
guess now I want to argue that when I do

486
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:48,039
this and I add Z it's not bad because I

487
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,000
add Z so I want to argue that this is

488
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:53,799
not equal to this minus Z or I guess xor

489
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
we're doing everything xor so minus plus

490
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:59,440
it's uh don't worry about it we'll we'll

491
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,679
get it later um so I want to AR arue

492
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,200
that this does not equal beta X or Z

493
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:11,960
because my hash is not just this it's

494
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,799
this X or Z that's my hash so I want to

495
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,159
arue that this X or Z is not beta which

496
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,840
is the same as saying that this is

497
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,360
different than beta X or

498
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,039
Z so now what I'm going to do I'm just

499
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,360
going

500
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,480
to here I'm going to exore in the

501
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,440
analysis I'm going to say sure let me

502
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,760
tell you if you change the G

503
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:37,320
Star if you take G Star to be the

504
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:40,000
decryption of bad X or Z and then change

505
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,400
it a little bit xort was just one like 0

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,799
z0 one or then I can argue that you get

507
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,440
statistical soundness so in the analysis

508
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,720
I'm going to say okay you started with

509
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,720
this g whatever it was suppose it was

510
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,440
just this G and then I can argue that

511
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,960
for this G it's never equal to this

512
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,720
because exactly as before well if for

513
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:07,760
this G star it will it was it was equal

514
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,960
to a so now I guess a if it was equal to

515
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,679
you

516
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,720
know beta X or Z then if then the

517
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,440
decryption would be equal and we got a

518
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,480
contradiction so it's exactly the fact

519
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,799
that I did I added Z has no significance

520
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,799
on the proof it's exactly the same

521
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,440
proof okay

522
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,320
so uh so and that's how I I simulate and

523
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,880
now I have a simulator so essentially

524
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,840
the way I proved that it's zero

525
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,279
knowledge is by doing just the honest

526
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,880
verifier zero

527
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:48,559
knowledge and then what I did in the

528
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:51,600
with the CRS I chose the Z I chose I

529
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,159
programmed part of the hash key if the

530
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,159
hash key was programmed by someone else

531
00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:00,320
ahead of time and I couldn't touch it I

532
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:02,039
don't know how to prove a soundness

533
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,880
okay but I I don't know how to

534
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:07,919
simulate but because I could I could uh

535
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,679
do it I could simulate so the fact that

536
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:15,679
I could I I had the freedom to program

537
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,760
the hash key that's what allowed me to

538
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,760
simulate and that's

539
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:25,640
why there's no that's what broke the

540
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,039
tension between and zero knowledge

541
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,919
because in the interactive setting when

542
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,559
there's no

543
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,200
CRS then a simulator really has the same

544
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,200
power as a cheating prover and now say

545
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,200
if there's a simulator there's a

546
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,640
cheating prover and when you think about

547
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,559
the simulator thing about like a

548
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,399
verifier who's like a f verifier like

549
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:50,039
verifier that behaves like a f hash

550
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:51,320
function then the simulator is exactly

551
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,520
like a cheating Pro and then you say

552
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,840
well there's no cheating Pro they can't

553
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,559
exist a simulator but in the niic the

554
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,919
simulator has much more power than this

555
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:04,120
cheating prover he can choose the CRS he

556
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,080
can program the CRS to his desire and

557
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,840
that's what breaks that's kind of what

558
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,679
allows us to get like both F and

559
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,679
noninteractive z and the non like both

560
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,679
sist and noninteractive zero

561
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,960
knowledge any questions yeah does the r

562
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,960
help is

563
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,679
not ah okay okay good good good so now

564
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,679
the qu okay so now the question is what

565
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,760
if beta bad was not unique okay so let

566
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,039
me I'll answer that because I have a

567
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,440
longer question a longer answer to that

568
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:46,039
but are there any other questions about

569
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,360
this before I I answer that

570
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,880
question okay

571
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,080
so let's step back and see where where

572
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,399
we are I I'm I'm on my way to your to

573
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,960
answer your question because it's about

574
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:58,720
how General this technique is so I want

575
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,840
I'll get there uh but before I go to J

576
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,000
technique let's see what we did today so

577
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:08,760
far so we uh started

578
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,360
by a we looked at this protocol the

579
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,880
parallel repeated version and we said

580
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,679
okay this protocol guess what it's F we

581
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,159
actually constructed a certain hash

582
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,520
function very specific hash function

583
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,760
said that with respect to this hash

584
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,919
function we proved

585
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,320
sness and then we proved not only is it

586
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,840
sound respect to now that it's not

587
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,440
interactive we can also prove that it's

588
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,279
zero knowledge like zero knowledge still

589
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:37,159
maintains by playing with a

590
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,080
CRS okay so uh so even before talking

591
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,799
about generalization I just want to

592
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,120
point this this was a huge open problem

593
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,600
for a very long time to get niic under

594
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,399
lwe uh even though what you saw it's

595
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,120
only circular secure LW or under if you

596
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,320
think under fhe you just saw the

597
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,600
circular secure version but even with a

598
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,039
circle secure

599
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,360
version It's I still find it remarkable

600
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,960
that I'm able to teach it like from

601
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,919
beginning to end uh in one class uh I

602
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,840
hope you understood but it seems like

603
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,600
from your question you were pretty good

604
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,240
A so um I don't know I wish I I could

605
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,440
torture you with previous attempts that

606
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,640
were much worse and much more

607
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,600
complicated so you will really kind of

608
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:22,640
appreciate this one uh but uh for me who

609
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,240
you know uh shed a lot of tears and

610
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,960
sweat with these previous approaches I

611
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,240
totally appreciate the beauty of of this

612
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,960
one uh

613
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,640
okay but now so so far it was kind of

614
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,159
the focus was on this protocol you know

615
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,360
had this protocol we now we have under

616
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,000
lwe great but how General is this

617
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,760
technique and that's what I want to talk

618
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,080
about next okay how General is it and I

619
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,320
want to point out actually we said we

620
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:58,320
used this specific structure very little

621
00:27:51,320 --> 00:28:01,159
what did we use a so let me actually a a

622
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,159
let's see what I should

623
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,279
erase let me start here

624
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:16,200
so we use the fact what did we use here

625
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,440
we used the fact that the beta was

626
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,880
unique that's one thing we used can we

627
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,120
do non-unique betas we can do non-unique

628
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:32,120
betas but we pay so the number of bad

629
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:35,039
betas can be let me we call it uh D but

630
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,880
our assumption degrades with one over D

631
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,240
because the way we deal with if there's

632
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,320
many bads then essentially what I do is

633
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,679
I'm going to guess which bad the the

634
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,760
approver is going to cheat with and if

635
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm going to choose a b a a random beta

636
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
out of this you know dbad betas with

637
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,559
probably one over D I got I got the I

638
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,360
guess his beta correctly and then

639
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,399
everything else goes kind of continues

640
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,480
as if it was unique so we canal with

641
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:05,080
more betas but we pay with the number of

642
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,519
betas of number of bad betas so if it's

643
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,960
really really huge then it's a problem

644
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,720
okay so we use the fact that it's Unique

645
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,440
beta but we also used one more thing

646
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,159
which is that we can efficiently compute

647
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,880
the bad

648
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,760
beta okay and that the the number

649
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,159
actually I feel like the unique beta as

650
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,720
I think your intuition was well you can

651
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,679
get around it a little bit like is it

652
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,640
unique well you know we can more as long

653
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,760
as I'll guess it and as long as you know

654
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,240
there is some degradation but the

655
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,200
efficiency of the beta we really used it

656
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,919
uh you know and the the C the hash

657
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,480
function computes the bad data so I

658
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:50,200
don't know at all how to deal with

659
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:54,440
inefficient a bad betas but let me just

660
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,120
um mention that still this result is

661
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,080
very uh

662
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,480
General and actually you can frame this

663
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,960
result in a much more General framework

664
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,679
uh which is than than kind of for this

665
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,559
specific protocol and the general

666
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,840
framework is the framework that's called

667
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,720
correlation intractable so let me tell

668
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,880
give you like let me just start with the

669
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,120
definition what is a correlation and

670
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,080
tractable hash function so correlation

671
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,440
tractable hash function was you was

672
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,240
defined in order in an attempt to

673
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,159
prove and a hash function is correlation

674
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,960
and tractable essentially if it if works

675
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,240
with it that's kind of the idea so let

676
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,440
me Define a Spector relation R so here's

677
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,559
a

678
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,559
definition a

679
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,559
correlation

680
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,240
intractable hash function Hash Hash

681
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,480
family with respect to a relation R so

682
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,360
we have some

683
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,080
relation

684
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,600
r r is a relation it's like a subset of

685
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,919
X comma

686
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,639
y okay you can think of X as let's say

687
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:13,919
in 0 1 to the

688
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,960
n and y I know 0 1 to the

689
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,240
n and you can think of both n and M is

690
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,120
like functions of security parameter so

691
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,900
n is like n of Lambda so for any

692
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,159
security

693
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,720
[Music]

694
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:31,519
parameter you have like a a uh length n

695
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,600
and M and you have a

696
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,360
relation and the hash family's

697
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,279
correlation intractable with respect to

698
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:43,440
this relation it essentially means that

699
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,440
for any for every poly signs

700
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,200
adversary the probability that this

701
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:53,360
adversary who gets hash key so the

702
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,480
adversary gets a hash key there's a hash

703
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,480
family let me call it h

704
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,360
that has gen

705
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,000
andal now the aders he gets hash key

706
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:15,600
generated according to

707
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,039
gen and his goal is to Output

708
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,039
X such

709
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:28,000
that h of

710
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:31,919
X is or such that X comma h of X is in

711
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,919
the relation such that X

712
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,080
comma eval hash key of

713
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,000
X is in

714
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,880
R okay so

715
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,799
again a correlation intractable hash

716
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,360
family with suspect to a c relation

717
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:53,440
R satisfies that for any poly siiz

718
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,679
adversary he gets a hash in the family

719
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,679
his goal is to find an X that hashes to

720
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:02,960
a y said that X and Y is an r and we say

721
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,720
that this probability is

722
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,000
negligible I didn't finish to write

723
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,200
it okay so for every poly size a there

724
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,799
exists a

725
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,720
negligible

726
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,000
Lambda such that the probability so any

727
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,360
poly siiz adversary he gets a random

728
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
hash key in the family and he's able to

729
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:31,279
find X at that h of X so that X comma h

730
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,919
of x is in R only with n probability so

731
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,600
he he always EV kind of uh evades the

732
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,440
why in the

733
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,840
relation that's called correlation

734
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,440
attractable hash

735
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,600
family for for specific

736
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,600
R questions about about the

737
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,360
definition so first note this makes

738
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,480
sense so I want to say do we have a

739
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,200
correlation tractable hash family and

740
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,639
for which relations

741
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,760
okay so this is kind of a major open

742
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:10,119
question because this is very related to

743
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,040
F so F we know take x n in the

744
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,800
language we want so think of Alpha Beta

745
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,639
gamma just think for three messages

746
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,879
everything I say now extends to more but

747
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,599
let's think of of three it extends to

748
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,760
constant at least but let's think of

749
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,560
three for

750
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,000
Simplicity so we want to evade like not

751
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,440
to tach to be correlation TR so the

752
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,040
relation in our case in F CH the

753
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,240
relation is like Alpha and beta are in

754
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,599
the relation if there exists a gamma

755
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,560
that will make it

756
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,480
accept Okay so for the relation contains

757
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,520
Alpha and the bad betas and we want to

758
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,040
avoid these bad betas so we want to say

759
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,280
that any adversary that gets a hash key

760
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,280
managed to hit a bad beta onlyn with

761
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,200
probability so there may there may exist

762
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,760
Alphas but he won't find them it'll be

763
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:10,800
hard for him to find kind of a X or an

764
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,800
alpha that hashes to Beta that is

765
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:17,200
bad okay and here I'm the idea is here

766
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,160
take any inter take any think of any

767
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,280
interactive proof like of the form Alpha

768
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,680
Beta

769
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,079
gamma and I want to say think the

770
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,000
relation think of the relation being all

771
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,400
the the relations of X take X not in the

772
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,640
language I guess now this x this x

773
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,320
corresponds to Alpha here but takes any

774
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
X not in the language and the relation

775
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,280
is all the alpha

776
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:46,520
beta so that exists a gamma

777
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,520
accepting so that Alpha Beta gamma is

778
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,319
accepting and I know that for every

779
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:56,920
Alpha there's very very few betas and I

780
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,640
want to say that the adversary output

781
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,119
Alpha Beta and the the relation like

782
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,880
alpas that the hash of alpha is in the

783
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:08,000
relation only with NE probability then I

784
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,000
have soundness of the

785
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,720
Fe was that too fast should I repeat the

786
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,720
connection to

787
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:24,040
F let me repeat it once more okay so I

788
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,480
want to argue that I have correlation

789
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,319
tractable hash family for a lot of

790
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,440
relations

791
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,079
actually before I I go note I can't hope

792
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,480
to have it for any relation the relation

793
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,280
has to be sparse if the relation is

794
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,400
everything maybe the everything every X

795
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,680
Y is in the relation then of course a

796
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,480
hash will hit like

797
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,079
trivial so the most I can hope for so

798
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,240
the question I really want to ask or the

799
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,760
most like the most general question

800
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,079
is

801
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,079
does there

802
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,680
exist uh correlation intractable hash

803
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,720
for every

804
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:09,720
evasive or also people sometimes call it

805
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,720
sparse

806
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,440
relation that's the question and by a

807
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,640
vas of over by sparse I just mean that

808
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,680
for every X there are very few y's that

809
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,000
are in the

810
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:28,119
relation so sparse means ah forgot me

811
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,119
sparse means this

812
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,880
this

813
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,839
means that for every X the probability

814
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,839
over a random

815
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,160
y that XY is in R is

816
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,079
negligible

817
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:53,079
yeah

818
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:55,200
for yes yes yes yes yes good okay good

819
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,920
so now let's go to yeah so now let's go

820
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,440
to F good so I want to ask if the exist

821
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,920
a correlation trable for every such

822
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,240
evasive or sparse language uh relation

823
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,079
now if there is I'm done why if there if

824
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,920
you can prove that there's correlation

825
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:14,319
tractable hat for every sparse

826
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,560
language I here's now I'll tell you now

827
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:18,560
here's the fature take X not in the

828
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,240
language the uh so take the correlation

829
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,839
tractable hash you had said there's a

830
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,680
correlation tractable hash take that

831
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,720
hash function now what I'm going to do

832
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,560
now I want to now take ex the language I

833
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,040
my the evasive relation that I look at

834
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,560
is this relation Alpha Beta is in the

835
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,920
relation if there exists gamma of course

836
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,480
it's evasive because it's a proof mean

837
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,119
there there's only negligible amount of

838
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,920
betas I can answer so it's evasive and

839
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,000
therefore the probability that you hit a

840
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:57,000
bad beta is negligible I'm done

841
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,520
proof so if I have a collision hash that

842
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,680
works for any Bas so for any Bas of

843
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,640
relation this holds for any R then I'm

844
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,440
good okay so if that for any R yes that

845
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,480
for any

846
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:16,400
R you don't hit it then I'm done

847
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,200
sound okay so then this was actually um

848
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,640
defined in an earlier work like 2004

849
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,240
maybe I don't really remember but a

850
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,640
while a while

851
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,359
back and then people ask okay so we need

852
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,440
to construct this evasive

853
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:30,359
functions so they proed that the random

854
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,200
Oracle model is the random Oracle is an

855
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,400
evasive function but beyond that they

856
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,400
were

857
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:42,800
stuck and what this result that the

858
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,760
ketti Lombardi weeks result show so let

859
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:51,680
me now uh def uh State the result in in

860
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:55,560
more general terms what it shows that

861
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,640
there exists a correlation intractable

862
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:02,680
hash for every

863
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:07,720
relation that is

864
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:09,280
a here okay for any relation that is

865
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,560
they call it

866
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,560
searchable I'll

867
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,920
explain in

868
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:21,800
time

869
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,599
T So search on time T just means that

870
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,280
searchable means that for every Alpha

871
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,640
there's a unique beta it's a search

872
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,760
problem it's like for every Alpha

873
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,680
there's a unique beta beta and this beta

874
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,560
can be computed in time

875
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,079
T so what they show is there exists a

876
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,880
coration in hash correlation intractable

877
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,560
hash for every that that is correlation

878
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:46,200
intractable for every relation

879
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:50,079
searchable in time T and this hash the

880
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,079
time to compute the hash grows with

881
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,800
T so essentially what they say is for

882
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:02,440
every polinomial t because the hatch

883
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,440
grows with T so for every polinomial

884
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,800
T there exists a Corr a a hash function

885
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,079
that grow depends on T and it's

886
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,800
correlation intractable with respect to

887
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,359
all relations that are searchable in

888
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,400
time T and again relation searchable in

889
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,960
time t

890
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,119
means that for every uh Alpha let me

891
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,240
don't note the relation in by this and

892
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,359
not X because

893
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,280
X often

894
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:35,640
denotes uh input and I want to think of

895
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,960
the relation as Alpha Beta instead of X

896
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,280
Y because then there's a confusion

897
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,480
between the X here and the X instance so

898
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,680
it just means that for that the relation

899
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,680
is a set of alpha

900
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,960
betas such that for every Alpha there

901
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,000
exists a

902
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:58,359
unique at most a unique maybe less but

903
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,440
at most uh so

904
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:01,880
at

905
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,760
most

906
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:10,119
unique

907
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:14,640
beta such that Alpha Beta is in R

908
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:17,440
and to go from alpha to Beta or B if

909
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,960
there's no beta is

910
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,960
computable in time

911
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,920
t Okay so a searchable relation means

912
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,640
for every Alpha there's a unique beta at

913
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,880
most unique maybe there's no beta but if

914
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,680
there is a beta it's Unique and from

915
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,960
alpha to compute the beta corresponding

916
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,520
to it in the relation can be done in

917
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,240
time

918
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,160
T and what they showed is that there

919
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,559
exists a single hash family so first

920
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:51,920
note of course of course if you fix a

921
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:54,160
relation that's searchable in time T of

922
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,280
course there's a hash that's correlation

923
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,520
tractable with respect to it just take

924
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,319
compute the beta and add

925
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:09,280
one okay again let me

926
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,280
uh let me move there so we'll have

927
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,780
[Applause]

928
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,559
this so we want to show a correlation

929
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:26,559
intractable hash with respect

930
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,960
to any relation that's searchable in

931
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,559
time te

932
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,319
and first I want to note I want one hash

933
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,440
that's correlation attractable for all

934
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:41,119
relations of course if you first choose

935
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,200
a relation if you first Cho of course

936
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,760
this what I'm saying now is a trivial

937
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,760
for any T

938
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,760
time

939
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,440
searchable relation there exists a

940
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,040
correlation intractable hash running in

941
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,040
time t

942
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,599
or close to

943
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,720
T that's easy what is the hash the hash

944
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,559
of

945
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:13,559
alpha will just be the beta that you're

946
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:16,720
searching for in the relation plus

947
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,839
one just avoid it somehow plus I

948
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,200
whatever one like just move move out of

949
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,880
the beta that's it that's

950
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,839
easy but what they show is something

951
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,280
much stronger they show the oppos they

952
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,040
show the the reverse order of

953
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,760
quantifiers they show that there exist

954
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,760
one hash

955
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:45,240
family and this has family is

956
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:45,240
correlation intractable for all T time

957
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,040
searchable

958
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:59,040
relations that's the difference

959
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,040
okay so let's so that's kind of what I

960
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,720
want to end end with I'm I want to prove

961
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,880
it to you because we we saw this proof

962
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,200
it's exactly the same thing but let's

963
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,559
just see it in this language but before

964
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,800
we go over the proof again or or just

965
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:22,000
remind the proof it's a so this is a

966
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,000
much stronger a this is a pretty general

967
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,839
statement and this thing

968
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,680
ment uh is used in many follow-up works

969
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:37,200
for

970
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:40,440
example this can be used uh almost to

971
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,400
prove the soundness of gkr for example

972
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,839
so or or some check let's do some check

973
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,920
for Simplicity because that's all the

974
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:50,319
ideas are there how can you do how can

975
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,200
you prove F sound for some check let's

976
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,880
just recall just for a

977
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,040
minute what the sum check is just so you

978
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,119
see how it it's not immediate by the way

979
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,760
it requires more crypto but I want to

980
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,440
give you a sense a little bit of the why

981
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,559
this is very useful so it's not

982
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,559
immediate but it definitely uses this

983
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,359
fact okay so let's see why let's as an

984
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,240
example let's look at the sum check so

985
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:25,280
suppose I have I want to prove that sum

986
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:30,599
of G B1 up to BM is equal to some value

987
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:33,880
V and I wanted do it in the in in the

988
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,760
F so what is the relation let's see it's

989
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,119
many rounds so it's harder but let's

990
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,000
just look at the first round for a

991
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,760
second so or the first three rounds so

992
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,920
we have a prover and a verifier suppose

993
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,599
this is false right so it's this is

994
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,480
actually it's actually

995
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,520
false but the Prov is trying to cheat me

996
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,760
so now the first thing the prover does

997
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,760
if you remember he gives a univariant

998
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,760
polinomial

999
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,680
now this uni mod is wrong I I'll put

1000
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,240
star because it's wrong why because I

1001
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:12,079
know the value here is actually not v

1002
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,880
he's proving that it's V he should be

1003
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,240
giving the value that he should be

1004
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,240
giving is

1005
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:28,480
G1 which is sum of G of

1006
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:28,480
G on B2 up to BM

1007
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,200
that's what he should be

1008
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,800
giving and I would check that when you

1009
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,359
take this and sum it only over B1 you

1010
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,559
get V but of course he's not going to

1011
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,280
give me this because when you sum this

1012
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:46,359
over B1 it's not V because the real

1013
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,440
answer this is not V so he will give me

1014
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:51,800
another one

1015
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:56,920
star what are the bad betas the bad

1016
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,920
betas so now beta bad

1017
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:04,720
are all the elements T in the

1018
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:09,440
field such that G1

1019
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:12,880
star is equal now with this now he can

1020
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,520
cheat if he managed to give me G star

1021
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,440
that's equal to GT now he kind of

1022
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,440
continues like with a good now he has a

1023
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,680
true statement lucky him so these are

1024
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,640
going to be really bad for me but there

1025
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,880
are very few of them like the degree the

1026
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,520
univ degree of this G so as long as I

1027
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,960
don't hit the degrees d as long as I

1028
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,599
don't hit this D bad I'm

1029
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,720
good and it's pretty easy to compute

1030
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:43,359
this thing because I'm gonna hard like I

1031
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:46,280
I'm gonna so Computing G1 may be hard

1032
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,240
but I can hardwire it it's like a trapo

1033
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,000
I have this I have this statement I can

1034
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,720
use G1 as a

1035
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,799
trapo and now compute once I have G1 as

1036
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:59,520
a trapo given G1 star Computing all the

1037
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:01,200
inputs that collide with my G1 there

1038
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,240
algorithms there's efficient algorithms

1039
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,319
for this so now it's efficient so all I

1040
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,440
I need to avoid so it's not searchable

1041
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,760
it's not one beta like we have here it's

1042
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,400
D betas but to go from one to d as I

1043
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,200
said you just guess you lose a factor of

1044
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,559
D it's really extends pretty easily so

1045
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,200
you apply

1046
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:25,920
done okay it's not that easy the reason

1047
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,440
it's not that easy is because now a t

1048
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,720
comes out from the

1049
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,599
F and the next G depends on this T

1050
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:37,599
because the next G is going to be the

1051
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,119
next G Star the next real G G2 is going

1052
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:43,559
to

1053
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:48,640
be some G that the real G here

1054
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:51,599
T1 and then B3 da d d d d d da so I

1055
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,559
don't I I I can't hardwire G2 ahead of

1056
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:57,480
time I don't know what T1 is things are

1057
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:59,599
not as simple so there's more it's not a

1058
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,319
but the first me the first part is

1059
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,680
Trivial and then you need to add add to

1060
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,839
throw on it a little more crypto and do

1061
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:11,000
some more work but it's this technique

1062
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:15,799
is used to prove gkr this technique is

1063
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,799
also used to prove the result of churi

1064
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:23,400
Jin and Jen Jen and Jin where Jen Jong

1065
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:27,720
Jin is gonna uh present next class where

1066
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:30,000
they use FIA to prove uh this uh the

1067
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,319
existence of a batch AR batch

1068
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,319
non-interactive argument so he'll

1069
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,880
explain what that is next time but again

1070
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,480
this technique so this technique is

1071
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,839
really is pretty

1072
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,559
General

1073
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:46,839
okay question before I just kind of REM

1074
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,839
remind you why why this

1075
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,839
holds questions yeah so you

1076
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:57,280
said compute all

1077
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:59,240
the keys Pi a random one okay exactly so

1078
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,799
in the analysis you can think of it yeah

1079
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:06,640
I'm going to so I have a cheating prover

1080
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:08,520
and ah okay it's a bit complicated but

1081
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,559
yes in in the analysis I'm going to say

1082
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,160
look I have a cheating prover so it

1083
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,480
means he he cheats with respect to one

1084
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,520
random with a random one here with

1085
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,400
probability one over D and then I'm

1086
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,599
going to get a contradict contradiction

1087
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,400
because it's going to cheat with anyone

1088
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:25,359
with netive probability for each one fix

1089
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,160
it with that he's going to CH with that

1090
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,440
with negtive probability so then you

1091
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,599
Union bound kind of and say okay so for

1092
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,000
he cheat the probability that he cheats

1093
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,799
with any of these is D times negligible

1094
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,960
so as long as D is polinomial you're

1095
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:42,559
good what will our function look like

1096
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,520
it's the exact same so okay so actually

1097
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,839
let me what so the question what was our

1098
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,480
hash function look like I'll I'll tell

1099
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:50,799
you exactly what it is when I prove this

1100
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,200
and you'll see it's the exact same hash

1101
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:56,000
function so I say here and that's the

1102
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,160
hash function that I'll use up there I

1103
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,280
say here

1104
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,400
that there exists a hash function that's

1105
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,400
correlation tractable respect to any T

1106
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,880
time searchable relation what is this

1107
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,400
hash function I'll tell you so the hash

1108
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,640
function so to say hash family I need to

1109
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,599
say what's

1110
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:17,520
gen and what's

1111
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,520
Ian so here is the

1112
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,559
Gen help me out what do the gend do

1113
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,920
key exactly he computes a public key for

1114
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,359
the fhe and encrypt something nobody

1115
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,160
cares we're never going to decrypt it it

1116
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:43,200
encrypts with public key just let's say

1117
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,480
the all zero string so it's not exactly

1118
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,480
T it's a little more than T we'll it's

1119
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,799
the T we'll see what encrypts T Prime

1120
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,799
like 0 t Prime T Prime is going to be

1121
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:56,559
very similar to T but tiny bit more t

1122
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:59,599
plus the decryption plus one we'll see

1123
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,240
but that that's the that's gen it

1124
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,880
outputs a publicy an encryption of a

1125
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,200
bunch of zeros how many a little more

1126
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,640
than T we'll see the exact number that's

1127
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:15,079
what gen does what does eval

1128
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:18,319
do eval given this this hash key so this

1129
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:22,280
is a hash key and given

1130
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:23,680
alpha or yeah Alpha what it does it

1131
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,319
simply

1132
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:31,200
computes the eval of the FH

1133
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:36,680
so FH can be evaluated a new Alpha and

1134
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:39,119
the cipher text and let me call this G

1135
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:42,280
hat because it's kind of describes a

1136
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,799
circuit and G hat which is what it does

1137
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:47,640
it essentially computes G of alpha

1138
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:49,839
encryption that's what this eval of f

1139
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:53,280
does it takes this is a universal

1140
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,280
circuit takes this input a circuit g a

1141
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,119
description of circuit G and outputs G

1142
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,880
of alpha

1143
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,720
and this event does this under the hood

1144
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,640
so he outputs whatever is encrypted here

1145
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,920
the all zero circuit whatever a

1146
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,440
description of this is let's say

1147
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,520
description of

1148
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,160
circuit so in that case it'll be

1149
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:14,200
encryption of zero that's what it does

1150
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,480
that's the that's the hash function that

1151
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,160
I'm going to argue as correlation

1152
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,839
intractable for every relation uh for

1153
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,960
every T time searchable

1154
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:25,520
relation so now give me your favorite T

1155
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,319
time searchable relation and I'll show

1156
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,559
you why it's a correlation tractable

1157
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,240
with respect to it so okay you give me

1158
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,839
your favorite relation let me say a

1159
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,520
relation is a bunch of Alpha and F of

1160
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:41,640
alpha it's searchable so there's

1161
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:45,359
some function that for every Alpha

1162
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:48,559
there's a unique beta find the unique

1163
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,520
beta okay if if in in the more General

1164
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,520
case where there's D think of there's d

1165
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,079
fs like so there's a few more but for

1166
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,480
one you can think of just one okay so

1167
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,000
now now I want to argue there's no way

1168
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,799
you can find okay so I'm going to I'm

1169
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,400
going to argue you can't find F1 but if

1170
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,440
there's more I'll I'll then you also

1171
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,720
can't find F2 and F3 but let me focus on

1172
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,520
the first F let's see if there's only

1173
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:13,119
one I'm going to show you on the first F

1174
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:16,200
so you cannot there's no way why

1175
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,160
because if you could if the adversary

1176
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,880
given hash

1177
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:25,599
key could find Alpha so that the hash of

1178
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:29,559
alpha is f of alpha then he could also

1179
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:32,960
do it in the case where I

1180
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:36,559
replace Alpha with where I replace G

1181
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,000
with a fake G and my fake G that I'm

1182
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,000
going to replace it

1183
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,839
with

1184
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,839
so so

1185
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:52,880
Suppose there exists an adversary that

1186
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:57,119
breaks then okay so uh that so there

1187
00:55:52,880 --> 00:56:01,599
exists an adversary that such that

1188
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:05,000
the adversary given hash key outputs

1189
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:09,640
Alpha such

1190
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:13,559
that eval of H key and

1191
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:15,119
Alpha is equal to F of alpha that's what

1192
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,520
we want to avoid we say no you shouldn't

1193
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,880
be able to find something in in the

1194
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,640
relation if you can if you can do that

1195
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:27,319
with probability greater than some

1196
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:30,599
Epsilon then I claim then

1197
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:34,119
a succeeds in the same thing

1198
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:36,520
succeeds with probability close like

1199
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:40,839
close to Epsilon

1200
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:45,200
also by semantic security also with HK

1201
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:48,000
star a different HK and what is HK star

1202
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,039
this it generates the same public key

1203
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,720
but it generates an encryption of G Star

1204
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:56,359
not of G so here I encrypted all zero g

1205
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:59,559
was all zero I'm encrypting a new g a g

1206
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:59,559
star what is

1207
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,520
gar g

1208
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,880
star uh an

1209
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:17,960
input Alpha outputs the decryption I

1210
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,720
know weird it has secret key hard wired

1211
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,480
in it and it outputs the

1212
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,559
decryption of kind of the bad

1213
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:29,319
function an alpha

1214
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,319
XR with

1215
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,240
one and we show that actually if this is

1216
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,400
what you put

1217
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:41,880
there you really that you you never it's

1218
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,559
impossible to Output F ofx this is never

1219
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,559
it's never the case so we want to say

1220
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:48,799
that G Star

1221
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:53,160
theal G Star

1222
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:56,240
Alpha is never F of f of alpha it's just

1223
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:58,319
never why because if it was then if you

1224
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,559
decrypt this and decrypt this you would

1225
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:02,799
get the same value but if you decrypt

1226
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,839
this you get G Star Alpha and if you

1227
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:07,160
decrypt this you get this and they're

1228
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:07,160
not the

1229
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,480
same

1230
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:16,280
yeah what

1231
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,559
is no F sorry I'm uh let me so we have a

1232
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,280
a t time searchable relation T time

1233
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,839
searchable relation it means that for

1234
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,920
every alha there's a unique beta so I

1235
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:26,920
call this beta sorry sorry so then is

1236
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:29,400
this over like all

1237
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,039
good so exactly so I want to say I say I

1238
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,920
constructed this hash family that just

1239
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:35,680
has an encryption and he does

1240
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,760
computation under the hood and I'm

1241
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,359
saying this hash family it's a

1242
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,119
correlation and tractable with respect

1243
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:44,839
to every T time searchable relation why

1244
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,079
fix your favorite T time searchable

1245
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:48,200
relation your favorite one the fact that

1246
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:50,480
it's searchable means that for every

1247
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,480
Alpha there's a unique beta and it's

1248
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,160
computable in time T so I call F the

1249
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:00,200
function that computes this beta and now

1250
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,599
I say look there's no way an adversary

1251
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,280
can find Alpha for which the hash

1252
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:08,160
function takes him to to Beta to F of

1253
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:11,079
alpha because if he could he could also

1254
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:13,400
do it where I where the hash key which

1255
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:17,280
encrypts zero actually

1256
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:19,440
encrypts this G Star another G what is g

1257
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,720
g star now G star depends on this F but

1258
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,520
it's under the hood nobody can tell the

1259
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,000
difference and this G Star it decrypts

1260
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,520
this F even though f is not a cipher

1261
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,760
attack so it's a very weird thing to do

1262
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:32,039
but it decrypts this F and changes

1263
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:35,640
something changes a bit and now I want

1264
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:38,280
to say the hash gives you encryption of

1265
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,640
G Star Alpha an encryption of gar Alpha

1266
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,599
cannot be F of alpha there's no way

1267
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,640
because if it was any encryption

1268
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,200
actually because if it was if you

1269
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,839
decrypted this and decrypted this you

1270
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,480
would get the same thing but you decrypt

1271
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:53,400
this you get G Star

1272
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:57,319
Alpha and G starpha is not decryption of

1273
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:00,720
f of alpha by by Design

1274
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:02,000
so once you change the hash key to this

1275
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,200
you're

1276
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,559
statistically C and and all powerful

1277
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:12,319
adversary cannot hit F so there's some

1278
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:15,839
kind of we use computational assumption

1279
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:16,920
but then once we once we move to Gar we

1280
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,720
we can we don't care about the

1281
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,839
Assumption anymore we're in statistical

1282
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,119
land even in all powerful adversary

1283
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:23,119
cannot

1284
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,960
cheat sorry I don't to ask no no it's

1285
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:30,960
fantastic question this still fine if

1286
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,160
the adversary picks the relation after

1287
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,039
it knows the hash key exact H yeah yeah

1288
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,119
exactly you're right so think about this

1289
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,920
the adversary get the hash key public

1290
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:43,760
key and encryption of something

1291
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:47,200
encryption of zero now he gives me f he

1292
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:50,359
tells me f with this F I can cheat I can

1293
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,119
find I can I'm get really okay can you

1294
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:54,200
distinguish between encryption of the

1295
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:56,599
all zero and encryption assuming

1296
01:00:54,200 --> 01:01:00,839
circular security yeah cuz this is kind

1297
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:03,200
of subse secret key but let's so it's

1298
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:06,119
I'm I'm using semantic this gar depends

1299
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,559
on F and then the secret key but

1300
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,799
assuming you can't break semantic

1301
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:13,720
security circle of

1302
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:16,319
security then he even if he chooses F he

1303
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,119
cannot distinguish between encryption of

1304
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,720
G star and encryption of zero assuming

1305
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:23,599
circular secure F I guess what prevents

1306
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,039
from just piing like f evaluation of

1307
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:29,440
Alpha and

1308
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:32,079
why can't F just be like

1309
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:36,920
evaluation like why can't he's just said

1310
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:39,599
oh okay good point hold on you're saying

1311
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:43,520
why

1312
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:46,559
a no okay okay okay sorry

1313
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,920
a no it's kind of weird yeah yeah yeah

1314
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,319
yeah yeah no no no you're right okay

1315
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,720
sorry sorry sorry uh he can choose f

1316
01:01:51,319 --> 01:01:56,119
after he sees the hash family the hash

1317
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,520
family the hash family no once you have

1318
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:00,000
the specific key then you're right

1319
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,160
you'll just be the hash key sorry I I

1320
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,440
miss I yeah there's one hash family

1321
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,160
after he sees the hash family he can

1322
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,680
choose the relation but of course for

1323
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,920
the specific hash

1324
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,520
key

1325
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,640
he'll yeah then yeah and and yeah

1326
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,319
exactly and that should just follow like

1327
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,119
the fact the cyer text is randomized

1328
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:22,480
right like once you have an an

1329
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,520
encryption of had like predicting the

1330
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,520
evaluation should be very exactly

1331
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:32,000
exactly exactly and just going back this

1332
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:33,760
T Prime is the time the the size of G

1333
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,559
Star so it's a little more than F

1334
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,520
because you also need to decrypt but

1335
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:41,200
it's very very similar to have just

1336
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,119
uh

1337
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,119
question this like the same kind of

1338
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,440
issue as to why it mattered that in some

1339
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,599
TR like the later bad relations depended

1340
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,880
on the verifier messages it's like if

1341
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,920
that wasn't the case then this exactly

1342
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,720
exactly exactly that was the same issue

1343
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:00,599
that came in GK that the things the T

1344
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:04,039
dependent yeah yeah that me yeah great

1345
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:05,119
great great question anybody else yeah I

1346
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:08,119
still don't

1347
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,119
see

1348
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:15,400
how if f is if f is what is not unique

1349
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:17,640
okay good so if f is what not unique

1350
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,240
what I'm going to show suppose Alpha has

1351
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,920
many FS F1 up to FD associated with them

1352
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,760
then I'm going to say look first let me

1353
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,000
argue that adversary cannot the

1354
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,160
probability that he outputs F1 is

1355
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,279
negligible so for every the probability

1356
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,039
that he outputs Alpha and F1 of alpha is

1357
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:37,319
negligible this I kind of convinced

1358
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:40,760
you but that's Al also for F2 and for F3

1359
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:42,440
oh so you use many yeah I'm just using

1360
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,039
exactly in the anal exactly so I'm

1361
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,760
saying exactly in the analysis I'm going

1362
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:50,039
to change my G Star exactly

1363
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:53,000
fantastic yeah so a simar idea how you

1364
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:56,440
define like our Cal or like relations

1365
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,200
that have like many Bas instead of

1366
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,680
exactly the the doing the many betas the

1367
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,720
only difference is it's exact same proof

1368
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:07,480
except that I'll I'll need to kind of

1369
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,839
choose one of them a I I'll degrade with

1370
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,559
d because I'm going to show for each one

1371
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:13,599
the probability that with that one you

1372
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:16,039
succeed is negligible and then I'll just

1373
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:19,400
do a union bound I guess my question a

1374
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:22,359
little I guess in

1375
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,599
cist uh CI function for all relations

1376
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:27,960
that are searchable in time and I was

1377
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:30,039
trying to how to extend the r definition

1378
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,400
to handle like cases where beta isn't

1379
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:34,799
easy yeah exactly so yeah essentially

1380
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,960
think of r instead of searchable it's

1381
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:42,520
like it has like F1 so for each Alpha

1382
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,640
there's F1 of alpha up to FD of alpha

1383
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,559
these are the betas corresponding to it

1384
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:50,119
so now that's your relation that's yeah

1385
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:53,119
okay great okay we're out of time guys

1386
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:56,359
thank you so much have a great peaceful

1387
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,000
fun Thanksgiving and I'll see you

1388
01:04:56,359 --> 01:05:00,680
uh not the week after but the week after

1389
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,680
after
