1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,480
Uh so in my part of the first lecture I

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,160
will before I get into the introduction

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,400
of some financial concepts and the

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,199
investment strategies give you some

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,080
basics uh and background information for

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,800
this class. I will tell you uh three

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,680
things first before that. First is bit

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,280
introduction of myself. Second I tell

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,000
you how this class was actually formed.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,840
Why we had this idea why we have decided

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,160
to have this class. Uh third is before

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
you actually do the assignment zero

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,960
submit your information. I'm going to

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,800
survey the class a little bit just get

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,359
some idea of your background of the

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,399
knowledge of financial markets and math

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,479
so we know you know what level we should

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,920
target uh you at okay so first about me

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,760
uh so my connection with MIT as Vasili

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,320
said also quite similar so I have a PhD

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,000
from core six electrical engineering and

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,280
computer science and uh I worked in the

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,040
engineering field uh as a researcher for

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,680
a few years. Um then switched to Wall

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,720
Street as a quant

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,880
means using mathematics building trading

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,680
models. Uh back then I joined uh Solomon

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,680
Brothers. So that tells you about my age

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
because probably how many of you have

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,560
heard about Solomon Brothers?

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
Oh, good for you. Okay. Is now part of

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,640
uh city group. uh but Solomon Brothers

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,360
back then was the pioneer of uh using

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,799
quantitative trading strategies and also

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:03,280
hiring mathematicians of doing those

36
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:08,080
so-called arbitrage models finding uh

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,640
one stock or bond versus another uh you

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
know basically uh finding relative

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
value.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,440
So I worked there for a couple of years

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,520
as a quant then Morgan Stanley recruited

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,640
me away uh to be a trader. Uh I ended up

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,760
staying there for over 17 years. Worked

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,480
as a various uh trading and trading

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,440
management roles globally got sent

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,319
around the globe. Uh that's where I

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,200
worked with uh uh Vasili.

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,760
Uh and uh in 2013,

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,879
that was the year when we first recorded

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,720
our open courseware uh video for this

51
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,280
class. I actually switched uh my job

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,319
from Morgan Stanley to uh Harvard

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
management company which is uh the

54
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,879
entity manages Harvard University's

55
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,920
endowment. I joined as uh as the chief

56
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,840
risk officer to oversee risk management

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,400
and also capital allocation. That's when

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,920
uh back then we had uh many internal uh

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,000
fund managers doing various strategies.

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,000
We since then uh changed our model about

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,120
seven years ago, seven eight years ago

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,560
to focus on investing with external

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,480
funds. I subsequently also switched my

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,040
focus uh full-time focusing on uh

65
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,440
investing and finding the right funds

66
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,920
and managers. I'll tell you a bit more

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,760
about that but I will save that for

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,280
later. Uh so that's basically uh about

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:55,200
me. So I tell you a bit about the class.

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:58,159
So back I want to say maybe uh 14 15

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,319
years ago when uh Vasilia and I were

72
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:05,040
working together at Morgan Stanley, we

73
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,439
came to MIT to recruit quite often and

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,599
Vasilia was from the math department. I

75
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,319
was from core six. So we met a lot of uh

76
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,799
really bright uh students with

77
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,320
quantitative background but they don't

78
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,759
really know much about finance and uh

79
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,560
they ask many good questions. So we just

80
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,759
felt like in a half an hour or one hour

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,840
interview time slot it's simply not

82
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,400
enough for us to answer all the

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,560
questions or get to know the students.

84
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,840
So may we figure maybe the best way is

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,639
to have a seminar to tell the students

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,120
more about how math is used in finance.

87
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,880
So one seminar lecture actually got

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,960
expanded to the whole term and uh so we

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,600
invited the different practitioners

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,160
talking about how math is being applied

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,840
in different fields solving different

92
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,639
problems

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,680
that the class actually got very uh

94
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,360
popular. I mean one of the first classes

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,080
we got students sit on the floor

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,880
everywhere they want to know about you

97
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,199
know should they pursue a career in

98
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,560
quantitative finance.

99
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,919
So the math department uh was very uh

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,880
supportive and so we teamed up with uh

101
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:29,199
Peter the following year to offer half

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,240
of the lectures in actually math to fill

103
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,759
up all the background knowledge and then

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,960
kept the half of the class uh talking

105
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,039
about application cases. We even had a

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,240
field trips taking all the students to

107
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,720
New York touring the trading floor of

108
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,039
Morgan Stanley. We did that for a few

109
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,120
years and uh we had uh various uh you

110
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,080
know fun and some students really ended

111
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,600
up working uh in New York. Some of them

112
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,639
are still there uh in various jobs. So

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,600
that's how this class came about.

114
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,000
So, let me turn the table around asking

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,680
you a few quick questions. You don't

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,160
have to state your name. Just raise your

117
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,639
hands. It's fine. How many of you have

118
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,520
watched our open courseware recording

119
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,960
from 2013?

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,759
Oh, great. Yeah. See five, six hands.

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,600
So, you you have you knew something

122
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,800
about this class. How many of you have

123
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,360
done internship jobs at the financial

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
firm?

125
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,520
A third. Okay.

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,759
How many of you are mass majors?

127
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,400
Most of you. How many of you are

128
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,199
graduate students?

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,840
Okay. A few. Uh how many of you actually

130
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,919
are outside MIT? Because we have Okay,

131
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,160
great. I want to welcome all the

132
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,240
students came you know cross from cross

133
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,520
registration or sitting from other

134
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,000
schools. We always had a feel uh from

135
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,000
other schools. So you're very welcome.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,599
If you are unfamiliar with some of the

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,160
MIT uh systems, please feel free to uh

138
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,199
seek for help.

139
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,240
So that's all about the introduction. So

140
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,280
let me get into the actual content for

141
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,599
this lecture. So as I said, the purpose

142
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,680
of this first lectures give you some

143
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,440
background information. I realize some

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,400
of you already have done intern uh jobs

145
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,759
so you know quite a bit but I but I want

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,400
to also uh be sensitive to the students

147
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,440
who have actually not done the

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,120
internship uh positions and I can give

149
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,680
you some basic knowledge and uh I I give

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,280
you one example in one of the first

151
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,880
years when we had this uh class uh so

152
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,840
there are some students didn't even know

153
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,520
what a stock is what the stock was.

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,599
Okay, so you shouldn't feel bad if you

155
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,440
have no knowledge about the financial

156
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,840
markets. We'll make sure you have plenty

157
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,000
of the knowledge when you finish the

158
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:14,080
class at the in December.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,560
Okay. So what is

160
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,800
you know finance or financial markets

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,319
about right? It's really about

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,360
there is a market of exchanges in the

163
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,199
original form. people come to the market

164
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,519
you know at the village exchanging goods

165
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,440
you know you have something I don't have

166
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,200
something I need something you know so

167
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,800
let's exchange so the stock exchange was

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,080
formed

169
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,680
with the same idea right so some buyers

170
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,920
want to own equity of a company I

171
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,720
explain what equity is equity is

172
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,120
basically ownership of a company uh

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,959
meaning stocks and uh they centralize

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,519
all the trading of these stocks at a

175
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,080
particular place. These are exchanges,

176
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,839
right? Many cities, large financial

177
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,800
centers have different exchanges.

178
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,760
And in the last few decades, that also

179
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,160
has changed. It's no longer that

180
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,240
centralized. So people do a lot of

181
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,480
over-the-counter OTC trading. So it's

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,440
trade by appointment, trade by

183
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,760
arrangement, trade by contract, right?

184
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,160
So you don't have to go to a centralized

185
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,399
exchange to finish a trade

186
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,160
or there are electronic communication

187
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,680
networks or ECNS. You can do that simply

188
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,920
electronically. I mean they also act as

189
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,959
distributed exchanges.

190
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,160
So these are kind of the major uh

191
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,720
platforms of markets. So what are the

192
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,200
products people actually are trading or

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,160
exchanging hands? first is simply money,

194
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,160
right? So Peter mentioned bitcoins.

195
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,440
Bitcoin is actually kind of form of

196
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,399
money, you know, not the fiat form but

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,279
you know different forms but you know

198
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:20,240
originally gold or metal or paper money

199
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,880
or coins but or now different currencies

200
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,000
issued by different governments. Those

201
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:33,040
were basically uh first way of first

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,760
essential product to to trade with. Then

203
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,560
you always hear about the stock market.

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,519
Stock market represents ownerships of

205
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,360
companies, right? Peter mentioned uh

206
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,560
Nvidia stock going up rapidly you know

207
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,440
because people bet on oh AI applications

208
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,680
the demand for GPU chips and so on data

209
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,880
centers. So to get ownership of a

210
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,200
company you buy stocks I mean also you

211
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:07,279
can buy equity indices meaning a basket

212
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:12,800
of stocks. So you probably have heard

213
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:14,480
S&P 500, right? So standard pool 500 is

214
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,560
essentially

215
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:23,279
five largest companies uh you know here.

216
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,480
So you can you can get exposure not to

217
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,120
just simply one company, you can get

218
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,640
exposure to many of them at the same

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:37,279
time. These are the ideas of index or uh

220
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,720
you know they can have uh different

221
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:44,079
forms of that traded in ETF exchange

222
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,519
traded funds also representing often

223
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:51,680
basket of different stocks

224
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:55,839
and uh there are also uh two kind of

225
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,079
tiers of markets. So the ex the exchange

226
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,399
traded stocks is called the listed

227
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,680
stocks. So they have to go through a

228
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:07,519
process called IPO initial public

229
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,680
offering to become listed on the

230
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:15,519
exchange. So but that's called the

231
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,160
primary ser uh process to go from a

232
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,040
private company become a public company

233
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
have stocks freely traded. There are

234
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,760
also private companies which I'll get

235
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,200
into later. But after it it become

236
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,600
listed is traded by many other people.

237
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,839
So it's called the secondary market. So

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,079
after primary getting listed is a

239
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,600
secondary market.

240
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,560
So

241
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,880
besides the large category of equity

242
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,880
market, there's also a big category of

243
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,480
bond or fixed income market. So bond is

244
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,760
essentially a loan where it's a

245
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,680
securitized loan. So it become listed

246
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,639
and tradable. So the most uh commonly uh

247
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,639
known bond is the US treasury bond,

248
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,399
right? US government borrows money from

249
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,519
the investors.

250
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,040
You know us or institutions

251
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,279
they pay interest periodically either

252
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,440
quarterly or semiannually.

253
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:21,440
And uh so the bond issuer has obligation

254
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,440
to pay back the whole principal amount

255
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,279
or the notional amount at the end of the

256
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,000
maturity but they can also default on

257
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,959
that payment on both the principal or

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,600
the interest. So bond has a credit risk

259
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,200
meaning that the issuer may not always

260
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,959
pay back right. So, so that involves the

261
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,360
exposure of the credit of the issuer.

262
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,839
So, that's

263
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,399
basically uh related to a whole bunch of

264
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:58,560
credit related products.

265
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:02,000
And uh 2008 global financial uh crisis

266
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,600
is really a credit crisis because that

267
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,680
started in the mortgage uh market.

268
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,160
people borrow money to buy houses but

269
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,160
couldn't pay back and also these

270
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,880
mortgages were restructured into

271
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,079
different kind of derivative products

272
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,880
and uh we'll get into that later.

273
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,000
So related to bonds there's a interest

274
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,079
rate curve which is also very important

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
right depends on maturity of the bonds

276
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,639
the interest payment is or the coupon is

277
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,279
actually different if you only borrow

278
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,160
for three months you pay certain

279
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,360
interest you borrow for 30 years you pay

280
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,240
another interest rate every year depends

281
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,560
on the curve shape of the interest rate

282
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,560
and as well as the supply demand and

283
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,120
many other factors.

284
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,519
The Federal Reserve Bank which is the

285
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,399
policy bank of the United States is

286
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,639
responsible of setting the short term

287
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:07,440
the the front end interest rate to

288
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,760
affect the whole interest rate curve. I

289
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
mean right now as many of you know the

290
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,160
interest rate curve is actually

291
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,600
inverted. the front end interest rate is

292
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,199
higher than the longer maturity which is

293
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,800
not often the case. Okay, we can also

294
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,639
get into that later. uh so related to

295
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
interest rates

296
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,560
there are you know uh real estate uh

297
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,199
products as I mentioned the mortgage and

298
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,800
the asset back securities

299
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,519
and another whole category is

300
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,000
commodities you know I mentioned gold

301
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,760
but there's also crude oil Peter's

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,639
example of the futures dipping down

303
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:52,480
below zero and uh agriculture products

304
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,880
right I mean now we're in the era of

305
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,880
electrifying everything electric

306
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,560
vehicles uses a lot of uh copper right

307
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:06,000
or lithium uh for batteries. So those

308
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,480
commodities were trading uh rapidly

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,440
higher and also follows the cycle.

310
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,600
So I I'm just giving you some ideas of

311
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,639
the basic products. But on top of all

312
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,839
these products, you can also have

313
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:26,880
derivative products meaning you can

314
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:29,279
derive a other contracts of trading. So

315
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,079
you can have options. So I don't just

316
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,880
buy the stock. I want to buy the right

317
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,680
to own the stock in the future. That is

318
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,279
the option. So it's a right but not the

319
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,040
obligation.

320
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,800
I can also say I don't want to buy it

321
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,639
now. I just want to buy it a year from

322
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:50,079
now. So that's a forward contract. So I

323
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:53,120
just want to buy the stock index futures

324
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,240
which is a very liquid and standardized

325
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,079
contract. So you can also say I want to

326
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,160
do a swap. I don't want to really buy

327
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,320
things. I want to say I buy it from you

328
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,319
now but a month later I sold it back to

329
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:10,079
you. So it's a swap contract. And so

330
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,160
there are many different ways of uh

331
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,439
structuring a product for different

332
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,160
purposes and the needs. So once you

333
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,240
actually land on a job like that you you

334
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,919
become an expert. Your math will be very

335
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,480
useful.

336
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,720
Okay. So who are the players in the

337
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,360
market?

338
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,840
So typically they are the banks you

339
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,360
deposit money with, right? Bank of

340
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,480
America, Chase, uh they take deposits,

341
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,200
they also lend out the money uh to uh

342
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,919
home builders or other commercial uh

343
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,400
projects. There are the investment banks

344
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,360
where you interview, they come to MIT to

345
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,440
recruit, right? So the Morgan Stanley's,

346
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,480
the Goldman Sachs and others, the JP

347
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,840
Morgans's uh JP Morgan was actually a a

348
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:02,000
commercial bank, but since uh the

349
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,919
termination of glass deagle law in 1999

350
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,320
999, they turned themselves into a

351
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,799
investment bank. in terms so back into

352
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,480
investment bank because many years ago

353
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,400
uh before 1930 they were they were

354
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,080
Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan were one

355
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,880
company

356
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,679
uh so they have essentially three main

357
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,720
uh divisions in the investment banking

358
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
business one is called equity so you

359
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
when you go interview if you're

360
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,960
interviewing with the equity department

361
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,000
you should know that that's to do with

362
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,360
stocks Okay. When you interview with the

363
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,080
fixed income department, you're going to

364
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,760
deal with bonds, interest rate curves,

365
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,679
currencies,

366
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,320
uh possibly commodities and other

367
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,039
derivatives. You can also join the

368
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,080
so-called IBD investment banking

369
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,679
division which is more about corporate

370
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,080
finance or raising money taking a

371
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,000
company from private to be listed public

372
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,720
company or issuing bonds or some other

373
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,039
ways. So they are doing more services

374
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:17,679
and the client uh uh relationship uh

375
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:20,720
planning and other type of uh uh uh

376
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,200
investment banking services. So beyond

377
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,880
the investment banking business of these

378
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,840
banks, they usually have asset

379
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,320
management division. So they produce

380
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,679
products such as funds, right? mutual

381
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,960
funds or other type of uh higher return

382
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,799
funds. They also provide wealth

383
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,600
management services helping uh the

384
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:49,200
individual or wealthy uh families to

385
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,880
manage their wealth. Uh

386
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
so

387
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,280
outside the banks there are hedge funds.

388
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,240
So some of the internship must be with

389
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,240
some hedge funds. Hedge funds are

390
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,200
essentially trading entities, right? So

391
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,520
they use their capital or their

392
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,679
investors capital try to generate

393
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,160
returns. So by the way at the end of

394
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,120
this I'm I'm going to play a assign a

395
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:17,039
game to all of you which is related to

396
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,360
uh investing and trading. Okay. So

397
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,240
retail investors. So they just simply

398
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,720
open a brokerage account and uh uh you

399
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,039
probably have and and your parents have

400
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,960
and trade central banks. They involve uh

401
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,000
they guiding the markets you know

402
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,240
usually uh providing liquidity or

403
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,720
intervening the currencies or whatever

404
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,280
they are policy driven. They are

405
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
corporates. So corporates come in mostly

406
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,640
for hedging purposes. They want to

407
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,120
reduce the exposure from their exports

408
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,039
or inputs.

409
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,200
What is the objective of all these

410
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:58,880
players involved uh in the markets?

411
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,120
In one sentence, they try to maximize uh

412
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,280
the gain. Why minimize the losses?

413
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay, because financial markets are

414
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,360
uncertain, right? So you don't know when

415
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,559
you initiate a trade you will end up

416
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,400
making money or losing money.

417
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,919
So investors have the money they seeking

418
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
returns.

419
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,400
The borrowers

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,720
or you can think about them as a

421
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,240
managers they actually they need the

422
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,159
money they can take the risk. Okay. So

423
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
the trade between lender and the

424
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,520
borrower is essentially the main driving

425
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,919
force of all the financial

426
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,240
relationships. You can always pair them

427
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,679
up this way. And uh another example

428
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,960
right I just quickly mentioned you

429
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,000
probably heard the terms LP versus GP.

430
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,240
LP means limited partners, GP means

431
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,400
general partners or in a simple words is

432
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,280
the investor versus hedge fund manager.

433
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,080
is that relationship. If you one day

434
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,000
want to raise a hedge fund, right? You

435
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,400
need to deal with your investors. So,

436
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,720
you need to uh sort out these kind of

437
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,159
relationships.

438
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,840
So, the trader types that we can

439
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,360
categorize into the three. One is the

440
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,840
hedgers, right? Like corporates, they

441
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,600
want to reduce risk. I mean, second is

442
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,200
the market maker like a lot of the

443
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,480
banking uh the bank trading desks, they

444
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
make

445
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,400
buying a price, a selling price or bid

446
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,919
or an offer. Their objective is to earn

447
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,240
that spread but not to take risk. Every

448
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,200
time they try to earn that spread then

449
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,000
quickly flatten out the position.

450
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,159
The last category are the risk seekers,

451
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,679
the proprietary traders or the fund

452
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,240
managers.

453
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:57,039
So they use their own capital to uh

454
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,200
initiate risk and hopefully they are

455
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:04,000
betting right to make a return.

456
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,240
So how is this all related to math

457
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,799
right? Why why you need to know all

458
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,280
these things? I assume you are in this

459
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,120
class because you have some interest of

460
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,440
finding out how math can be used uh in

461
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,679
the financial markets.

462
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,280
So the math is used also in the three

463
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,080
different ways. One is to uh come up

464
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,240
with a pricing model because these

465
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,159
instruments especially the derivatives

466
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,520
the options the forwards the swaps

467
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,840
is actually quite complicated.

468
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,720
In one of the guest lectures later on in

469
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,080
the term you will hear from John Hall.

470
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,280
He wrote a textbook many years ago on

471
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,600
how to price options.

472
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,960
you know, Vasilia and I probably will

473
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,000
back then all the, you know,

474
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,559
uh, hungry readers of those books to

475
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,280
figure out, uh, how differential

476
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,760
equations can be used. I mean, he was a

477
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:09,600
pioneer in this field and MIT actually

478
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,039
is at the was at was at the frontier of

479
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,960
all these innovations back in the 70s,

480
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,000
right? So you probably heard the Nobel

481
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,120
Prize given in the 90s to the black

482
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,279
shows merin model. So that was a model

483
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,880
using mathematics

484
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,919
to price options right. So they won uh

485
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,679
economic prize uh Nobel Nobel prize in

486
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,240
economics.

487
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,720
So that's the pricing model side. The

488
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,039
second part is also very important is

489
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,320
risk management. I mean when you take on

490
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,159
a risk take on a position

491
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,520
you first question you have to decide is

492
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,080
how big the position should be right so

493
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,200
you have certain amount of money do you

494
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,559
want to put all in all your chips on one

495
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,440
stock or you want to diversify put them

496
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,760
into different stocks once you put your

497
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,880
investment in when do you change your

498
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,960
mind when do you sell when do you take

499
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,360
profit when do you cut losses

500
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,480
Right? So

501
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,840
all the things you know your greed your

502
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,880
emotions will drive you and on one hand

503
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,919
your fear will also drive you on in

504
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,400
other situations. So risk management is

505
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,320
actually a very quantitative process.

506
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,440
You should let math uh speak for that uh

507
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,880
process. The last one is I think most

508
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,000
people are interested in especially

509
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,400
sitting in your seats. You say if you

510
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,279
can make a trading strategy perpetual

511
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,840
moneymaking machine using some kind of a

512
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,240
hidden mathematics wouldn't that be so

513
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,200
cool right you just go to the beach and

514
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,960
let the machine make money for you. I

515
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,520
mean that's the dream of uh many

516
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,720
quantitative managers and I would say

517
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,760
some of them are very successful some of

518
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,880
the funds out there they have achieved

519
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,720
amazing outcomes using mathematics but

520
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,559
the problem is once they found those

521
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,720
secrets they would never disclose it and

522
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,000
if you join them they'll ask you to sign

523
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,039
a lifetime non-compete meaning when you

524
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,039
leave the shop you cannot say a word of

525
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,880
what you learned yeah go ahead If you

526
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,159
sign a lifetime long-term fee, don't

527
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,279
they have to pay seven is where they

528
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,679
fire you ultimately?

529
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,960
>> Yes.

530
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
>> For a lifetime.

531
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,200
>> Not not a lifetime unfortunately. Yeah.

532
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,919
So, we're not going to get into that uh

533
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,760
for this. Yeah. But I first step you

534
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:43,679
have to find those secrets. Okay.

535
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,080
Uh so how do you find those secrets?

536
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,720
Right. So people say okay why don't you

537
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,360
just look at the data, right? learn from

538
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,960
the historical patterns then extrapolate

539
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:58,640
them. Right? The efficient market theory

540
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,360
says that's not possible. If is there

541
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,440
such thing you know $100 bills lying on

542
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,159
the ground there will have already have

543
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,000
been picked up long time ago. Why would

544
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,600
that secret waiting for you to uncover,

545
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,559
right? There are many smart people

546
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,039
before you. The behavioral finance

547
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,640
theory says, "Oh, wait a second." You

548
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,520
know, because people are not totally

549
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,279
rational under certain situations. We're

550
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,120
not thinking rationally. That's why

551
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,600
we're providing these opportunities for

552
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,039
others to explore.

553
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,039
Is this a zero sum game?

554
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,400
So,

555
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,279
I'm getting into now investment

556
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,760
strategies. Okay? I'm not of course

557
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,480
telling you all the secrets, but I'm

558
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,279
laying all the steps for you to think

559
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,320
about what you should focus on. So you

560
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,000
first you should focus on do you want to

561
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,399
do this by yourself or you want to hire

562
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,360
other people to do it for you, right? So

563
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:01,120
this is the direct versus investing in

564
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,159
other people's funds or fund of funds.

565
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,320
Do you want to focus on publicly traded

566
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,799
markets? As I said, all these things,

567
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,440
stock, bonds, currencies,

568
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,600
or you probably interviewed or heard

569
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,320
venture capital, private equity,

570
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,480
buyouts, uh, re real estate funds,

571
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,360
natural resource funds. I mean, they're

572
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,760
not so transparent, but they seem to

573
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,760
make a lot of returns too, right? You

574
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,080
need to pick. These are very two very

575
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,360
different markets.

576
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,320
Also, passive versus active.

577
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Do you want to do the stock picking,

578
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,880
selecting the stocks, or you just want

579
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,679
to buy the index? Buying S&P 500 in the

580
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,720
last 10 years would have done very well

581
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:51,200
and beating most of the fund managers,

582
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:55,640
right? So why shouldn't you

583
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,640
just, you know, do the passive

584
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,679
also systematic versus discretionary? Do

585
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,880
you want to make decisions based on some

586
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,799
systematic or quantitative rules, models

587
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,360
or every time you want to make a

588
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,919
decision by yourself using your human

589
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,960
brain?

590
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,320
Do you want to even you want to follow

591
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,679
the quantitative model using math? Do

592
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,440
you want look for statistical patterns

593
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,919
or some deterministic relationships?

594
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,799
deterministic relationships like like a

595
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,240
lot of physics right if A plus B you

596
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,960
know you will get C but in statistics

597
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,960
you'll have a probability of getting C

598
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,760
right so I would say nowadays finding

599
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,679
deterministic arbitrage or trading

600
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,880
strategies very hot those those $100

601
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,679
bills are definitely have picked up but

602
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,000
sometimes they still show up

603
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,880
do you want to trend following or mean

604
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,679
reversion. That means when market goes

605
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,520
up, do you want to buy more or market

606
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,159
goes up, you want to sell, you play the

607
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,880
contrarian or you buy at the dip?

608
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,600
Do you want to focus on shortterm or you

609
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,320
focus on long-term? short term you're

610
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,559
trading very fast and uh you're trading

611
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,559
in the liquid very you can change your

612
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,679
mind easily or you you make your

613
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,880
decisions very slowly you take your time

614
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,960
I mean the uh startup companies you

615
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,799
invest with your venture capital may

616
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,840
take 10 years to find out if it's

617
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,919
successful or not

618
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,039
do you want to be a Warren Buffett like

619
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,679
value investor right you look at the

620
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,520
current price should be much lower than

621
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,799
its value or you focus on the growth of

622
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,440
the company. You project Nvidia's future

623
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,399
income for the next 10 years. As long as

624
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,960
the future value is going to be greater

625
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:04,159
than the current value, you you can you

626
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,320
can invest in it. I would say in the

627
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,520
last few years more and more people are

628
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,600
focusing growth rather than value. You

629
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,760
need to figure out why. Okay. and

630
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,840
history versus future, right? Do you

631
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,880
want do you believe history will repeat

632
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:26,080
itself? So you follow the patterns or

633
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,559
you actually don't simply extrapolate

634
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,399
into the future.

635
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,399
The key is you need to understand your

636
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,720
own objectives.

637
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,519
So your objective is to maximize your

638
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,559
gain, right? Versus minimizing your

639
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:45,519
loss. But that's not all of it, right?

640
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,240
You need to understand why do you need

641
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,120
the money?

642
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,480
What's it for? How much can you afford

643
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,919
to lose? How much you going to spend

644
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,640
every year and your life horizon of

645
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,120
income versus spending.

646
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,120
Uh this is a whole set of investment

647
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,240
objectives you need to understand about

648
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,720
yourself. Then you need to pick an area

649
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,559
you are the best. You are the best. you

650
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,159
have an edge over the rest of the

651
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,240
market, right? You need to understand

652
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,279
why you are you should make money, other

653
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,600
people should give you the money and uh

654
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,679
you need to find suitable strategy for

655
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,640
you. Ultimately,

656
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:31,000
if math is your strength, you need to

657
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,000
make math your edge.

658
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,799
Okay, for that uh I'm going to quickly

659
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,880
talk about the uh trading game, then I

660
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,240
will pass on to Vasili. So this game is

661
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,640
about for every single one of you to

662
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,720
pick a stock or ETF

663
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,640
exchange traded funds just traded like

664
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,320
stock or bonds or whatever only to buy.

665
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Okay. So I know some of you are more

666
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,000
sophisticated say can I short? If you

667
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:06,559
want to go short you buy the short uh

668
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,200
related ETF. Okay. So, pick one stock.

669
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,200
You are hypothetically given $10,000.

670
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Everyone has $10,000. Each one of you,

671
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,919
you need to let us know, email us your

672
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,519
selection. You you pick only one thing.

673
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,640
You let us know before September 14th.

674
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,159
We're going to we're going to give you

675
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,440
the slide on the website. So, don't

676
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,440
worry. Uh the price you buy is at the

677
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,640
close of Friday of September 13.

678
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,440
The price you sell is automatically set

679
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,519
on Friday, November 15th. So about two

680
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,919
month period.

681
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,840
So you need to track on the spreadsheet

682
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,480
how many shares you have bought. That's

683
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,320
easy. $10,000, right? You know, you just

684
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:56,159
convert into shares uh divided by per

685
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,320
share price and uh your daily profit and

686
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,600
loss in dollar and percentage. That

687
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,679
gives you a practice of how to track

688
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,120
your position. Okay. Every day there's a

689
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,000
P&L profit and loss. At the end of the

690
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,399
close on November 15th, calculate the

691
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,720
total loss or or profit and also why I

692
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,760
want you to do one calculation to sum up

693
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,639
all the daily gains on one side called G

694
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,079
and sum up all the daily losses

695
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,879
called L in dollar terms. So G minus L

696
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,200
should be your net profit and loss. But

697
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,079
I want you to calculate that ratio G

698
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,679
minus L divid by G plus L. That gives

699
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,240
you the quality of your trading

700
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,359
strategy.

701
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,720
A bonus, you're giving one time chance

702
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:49,520
to change your mind on October 11th

703
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,879
close. You email us your decision if you

704
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,079
want to switch on before October 12th.

705
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,000
You can switch to one other uh position.

706
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,400
You can decide not to switch. But when

707
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,960
you switch, you carry the balance

708
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,320
whatever is left your $10,000 maybe

709
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,440
1,000 left or become five uh 50 grand

710
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,079
whatever roll into a new position. So at

711
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,359
the end of the term we will announce the

712
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,680
top three leaders. Okay, for that I pass

713
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,680
on to Vasili.
