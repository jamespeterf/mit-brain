CLAUDIA URREA: Systems
thinking is a discipline

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,130
for seeing the whole,
rather than just the parts,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,450
and for understanding how
things fit together and change

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,710
over time.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,160
So understanding the
interconnectedness

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,830
of the work and the actions
that bring us together,

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,640
the power of collecting
efforts really

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,425
brings us hope today and brings
us together at this event.

00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:33,560

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,830
Climate change offers
a unique opportunity

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,590
because it's the first
time in human history

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,516
that all nations face
a common problem.

YASHASVI RAJ: This photo
is called Earth Rise

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,500
and it was taken in 1968, during
the Apollo 8 lunar mission.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,980
And this was a really
impactful photo at the time

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,730
because it showed our
vast and powerful Earth

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,180
as actually just a small and
delicate and finite planet.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,900
And this helped realize that
we really need to protect it.

JAYLEN BROWN: A lot of people
have a hard time seeing

28
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,160
that climate change is
affecting our day to day lives,

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,780
they see it as
something distant.

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,350
But the reality that climate
change is already here,

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,470
our air, our oceans, our forests
are already being compromised.

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,450
These aren't just
social media events.

33
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,840
We've already seen the
fires in California

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,658
to the hurricanes
in the Caribbean.

00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,450
PETE BOUCHARD: And when
I think about that,

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,020
I think about climate change
and how the now is probably

37
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,020
the most important part
of where we are because we

38
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,080
can't change the past.

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,140
We're living on what
happened in the past

40
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,018
and in the future
it's still undecided.

41
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,810
We still don't know
what's going to happen.

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,740
But if we plan for the now,
if we plan for the future,

43
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,680
and everything that we can do
to stem the tide of emissions,

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,389
we can actually
make a difference.

45
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,210
But we're at the
precipice, time is short.

46
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,630
There's not a lot of it left.

LAELIA MAYNOR: I know
like Sophie, I've

48
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,520
struggled a lot with climate
anxiety and depression

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,670
and doomism.

50
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,440
Public officials
aren't doing anything,

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,970
the companies aren't
doing anything.

52
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,710
How are we ever
going to change this?

53
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,440
And being able to
critically reflect

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,590
on my own thought processes and
feelings have allowed me to show

55
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,120
up more presently in
these climate spaces,

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,780
alongside learning about
the amazing initiatives

57
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,990
that students and teachers and
just people across the world

58
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,330
have done that have deeply
changed their local ecosystems,

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,200
it's very inspiring.

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,620
The water has a memory.

It remembers what you did.

CHRISTOPHER KNITTEL: We at
MIT have a lot of resources

66
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,520
available, not just to
MIT students, but to K

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,650
through 12 more generally.

68
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,010
And that got me really excited
about potentially developing

69
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,880
a high school curriculum that
was based on MIT resources

70
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,880
and based on MIT research.

71
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,660
That all came together
to what we call CATE,

72
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,980
so Climate Action
Through Education.

73
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,080
It's a interdisciplinary
high school curriculum

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,650
that's science-based,
standards-based, and modular.

75
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,782
And most importantly, it's free.

SOPHIE SHEN: There
are so many ways

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,890
to get involved, that could be
starting a community garden,

78
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,680
they can be great community
hubs, great learning spaces.

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,310
That could include advocating
to your local or your state

80
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,130
government.

81
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,990
They're super accessible
a lot of times,

82
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,347
and that's a really great
way to get your voice heard.

83
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,930
YASHASVI RAJ: And
that's where you all

84
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,810
come in, not just as future
scientists, but as educators

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,940
and activists,
policymakers, engineers,

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,150
and informed citizens.

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,130
Because climate action
isn't just about technology,

it's about collaboration
and community.

it's the importance of love.

95
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,180
a small stepping
stone in actually
