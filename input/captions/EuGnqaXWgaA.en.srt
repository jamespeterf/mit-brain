1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,030
Even if it was cold, what I would
do is go outside at night and get

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,450
a blanket and just, you know, stay
all night just watching the stars.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,069
There is something fascinating in
watching the sky for hours at a time.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,770
First of all, you see the
spectacle of different stars

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,190
as the Earth is turning, right?

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,330
There's a satellite and
there's a shooting star.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,730
And sometimes the shooting
stars have different colors.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,660
Depending on what is the material they
have, they will glow in a different color.

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,589
And they will glow with
different intensities.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,139
But if you're not looking for
hours, you will miss all this.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,650
Yeah, I don't, I don't even remember
when I started, but I was very young,

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,360
so, so young that I don't remember when
I started to be interested in space.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,860
My parents took me to a planetarium
for the first time, and actually

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,150
it was, I think back then, the only
planetarium in Mexico City at least.

15
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,520
And for me it was just eye opening,
because the history of the universe from

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,934
the Big Bang and then telling the things
about the lives of stars and planets.

17
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:10,354
And the fate of these stars,
depending on their size, and some

18
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:13,384
of them will blow up and some
others will turn into black holes.

19
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:17,465
So I was like, just, you know, I was,
it was just like too much for me.

20
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:22,634
Again, it was probably the again, one
of the, the most memorable- I still

21
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,735
remember it, and I was about 10 years old.

22
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:30,305
And I think it was mostly because of, you
know, kind of getting to know the unknown.

23
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:34,994
And there were so many fascinating
things out there that we didn't

24
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:40,919
understand as humanity And I was so
interested about each one of them.

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,320
And then the prospect of actually
going to space and exploring.

26
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:47,599
For me that was just, uh, too much.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,940
It was fascinating.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,040
I just wanted to contribute to space
exploration, uh, and understand the

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,960
physics behind the, you know, the
working principles of the universe.

30
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:08,070
And the more tools I could
get to help me understand this

31
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,919
and contribute it, the better.

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,310
You know, where is the
action happening, right?

33
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,210
And of course I knew about NASA and all
the other places that I would hear in

34
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,999
Carl Sagan's Cosmos series, for example.

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,569
MIT's name will come up, right,
eventually, in one way or another.

36
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:31,370
Because, you know, you can find
pretty much an expert on every

37
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,360
branch of interesting science
and interesting technology.

38
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,520
And, and just the fact that you can,
you know, walk around the infinite

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,480
corridor and suddenly you see the
person who wrote the textbook or

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
the person who won the Nobel Prize.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,210
I, I mean, that, that,
that is also inspiring.

42
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,939
I never imagined that I could be
a professor in a place like MIT.

43
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,810
And the fact that that happened,
that was very inspiring for me.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
It's a community that
is very open to ideas.

45
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:07,525
And find weak points on hypotheses
and discover new things and, you

46
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:08,575
know, all these kind of things.

47
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:13,465
And now since I'm a faculty, I
would say that what makes MIT very,

48
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:16,745
very truly special is the students.

49
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,194
We have the best students.

50
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,445
I mean, they are way
smarter than the faculty.

51
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:26,565
I mean, we probably as faculty don't
want to admit that, but the students are

52
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,204
like here and we're like that, right?

53
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:30,035
And it's amazing to work with them.

54
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:34,935
You know, every time you're riding your
bike or driving to campus or taking the

55
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:40,435
bus, you're looking forward to actually
chat with your students because you're

56
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,434
always going to learn something from them.

57
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:48,755
And I think that that's one of the key
things that make, in my view, MIT special.
