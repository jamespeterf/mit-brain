1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,920
Hello. Can people hear me?

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,920
Hello?

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,160
Getting some thumbs up.

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,640
Okay, why don't we get started? Um,

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,920
hello everybody. I'm Brenmore. Uh, if

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,719
you've been coming to lecture, you've

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,520
already met, uh, Eric and Zach. I'm the

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,440
third instructor for this course. Uh,

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
today we are going to switch gears a

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,200
little bit. So, we're going to move on

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,160
from uh, state machines and we're going

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,480
to start a new unit on uh, algorithmic

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,239
analysis. Uh so we'll be looking at that

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,079
until the end of uh until the end of

15
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:02,559
next week. Uh this lecture is going to

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,760
be about sums. Okay. So sums are quite

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,439
useful uh as I hinted out a moment ago.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
They're good for algorithmic analysis.

19
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,240
You'll use uh you know everything in

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,680
this unit uh quite a bit if you take uh

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,759
61210 or any other algorithms course. Uh

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,200
they're also useful for things like you

23
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,560
know probability uh counting uh machine

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
learning everything's useful for machine

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,960
learning nowadays uh recurrences and you

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,720
know bunch of other things. Okay so

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,200
let's start with uh let's start with an

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,320
example. Okay has anybody here ever won

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,840
the lottery?

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Hands. Nobody really Oh come on guys.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,920
Okay. Uh well does anybody know how it

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,680
works?

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,479
So, if you if you win a million dollars

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,320
in the lottery, uh it it turns out you

35
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,920
don't actually get a check for a million

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,880
dollars in the mail. Or you do, but it

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,040
won't it won't cash. Uh it actually

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,399
comes in installments. Okay? So, imagine

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,799
you get, you know, $50,000 now and, you

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,319
know, $50,000 next year and so on for

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,920
the next 20 years. Okay? So, you know,

42
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,720
in total it ends up being a million

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,640
dollars in some sense, right?

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,000
Uh, but does it have the same value? Who

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
would who would prefer to have a million

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,599
dollars right now?

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
Lots of hands. Who would prefer to have

48
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,160
the uh the installments? 50,000 per year

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,080
for 20 years. Oh, a few hands. Uh, can I

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,000
get some reasons?

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Oh, you don't waste it all at once.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,040
Oh, that's an excellent reason.

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,560
Suppose maybe anybody else. A reason

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,560
either way. Yeah.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Sorry.

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,280
Yeah. Okay. So, that's that's an

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,000
argument for uh getting the million

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,959
dollars right now, right? Uh the the

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,360
$50,000 you get in 20 years, right? Like

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,080
if uh if you know a gallon of milk

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,959
costs, you know, four $4 today and like

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,360
$10 in in 20 years, like that $50,000

63
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,959
isn't going to go so far, right?

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,040
Uh so you know at least in terms of the

65
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,280
actual you know buying power of the

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,800
money you'd really prefer to have that

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
$1 million right now. Uh cuz you know

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,720
money now is more valuable than money in

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
the future. Inflation or relatedly you

70
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,879
can invest this money and it'll end up

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,519
being more worth more in in uh in 20

72
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,920
years. Okay.

73
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,920
So this is you know exactly how a loan

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,560
works right? you uh you know you get a

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,799
lump sum of money now and you pay it

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
back in installments uh and you know you

77
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,000
account for interest. Uh so this is

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,000
what's known as an annuity.

79
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,440
Uh so for an annuity we're going to make

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
some you know fairly simplified

82
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,680
assumptions. We're going to assume a

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,680
fixed interest rate

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,879
uh let's call it P. Okay. So as an

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,560
example the uh Federal Reserve says that

86
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,040
uh you know interest rate right now is

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
about 5.33%.

88
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,720
So let's just take that as a working

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,720
example

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,600
or at least that's what it was at the

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,360
beginning of the week. I haven't checked

92
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,759
it today.

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,600
Uh, okay. And we're going to get m

94
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,000
dollars

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,000
every year

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,240
for

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,240
n years.

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
Okay.

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,000
So, in the example that we were just

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,520
looking at, uh, m is 50k, n is 20 years,

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
and you know, we've got this interest

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,840
rate p 5.33%.

103
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,680
Okay, so what does this mean about the

104
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,199
value of money over time?

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Well, $1 now.

106
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,039
If we get this $1 now, you know, it's

107
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,240
going to be worth or it's, you know,

108
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:15,800
equivalent to getting 1 plus P dollar

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,800
one year from now.

110
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,440
Does that make sense to everybody?

111
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,880
Right? Like if I take my my $1 now and I

112
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,680
invest it, I'll end up with like $15

113
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,520
uh in a year. Okay? Or in two years

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,280
it'll be 1 plus p^ squ or you know in k

115
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,000
years it'll be 1 plus p to the k. Okay.

116
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,560
Uh conversely what if I get that dollar

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,280
in you know 10 years how much is that

118
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,360
worth in today's money?

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,360
Anybody

120
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,360
hunt?

121
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,000
No.

122
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,320
Are we still asleep too early in the

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,199
morning? Okay. Well, you know,

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,919
conversely, if uh uh if I get my dollar

125
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,160
in 10 years, it's going to be worth 1 /

126
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,479
1 plus b to the 10th. Okay. Does that

127
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,840
make sense to everybody?

128
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:16,160
Yes. No. Kind of. Thumbs up. Few thumbs

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,680
up. Okay. Good. Good. I'll I'll take it.

130
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
Okay.

131
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,880
So, basically what's going on is we're

132
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:29,199
getting M dollars now

133
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,400
M dollars in one year

134
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:37,680
M dollars in two years. Okay. Dot dot

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:40,720
dot up to n years.

136
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,199
And we'd like to kind of figure out what

137
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,440
the equivalent value is today. Okay. So

138
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,960
this M dollars now you know this is

139
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,960
worth M dollars today.

140
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,919
Okay. Uh this M dollars in one year is

141
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:07,120
going to be worth

142
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:11,360
uh oops m * 1 + pus

143
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:19,440
1. Okay. This ms in two years is going

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:22,160
to be m * 1 + p the minus 2 etc.

145
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,639
And the ms that we get in n years is

146
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:30,479
going to be m * 1 + p

147
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,840
to the minus n. I guess this is uh n

148
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,400
minus one, right? Yeah, we're starting

149
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,400
at zero years.

150
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,720
Okay,

151
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,960
does that make sense to everybody?

152
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,639
So, what is the total value the total

153
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,560
equivalent value in in today's money?

154
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
Okay,

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,000
we we'd like this in a closed form.

156
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,319
Okay, so right now we've kind of got

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
we're trying to sum all of this up,

158
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
right? But it's not a very nice

159
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,440
expression. Okay. We we'd like a closed

160
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
form. Something that you can, you know,

161
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
put into one of those oldfashioned

162
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
calculators if you've ever seen it. You

163
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,879
know, those things that you hold in your

164
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,560
hand and push the buttons on it. No. Oh,

165
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,440
yeah. Okay. There there are some old

166
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,840
souls in the audience. Okay. Uh but

167
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,680
yeah, we don't want any like uh ellipses

168
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,599
like this or, you know, sigma notation

169
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
or anything like that. We just want a

170
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
nice clean expression that you can put

171
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:32,120
into a calculator. So, how could we go

172
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,120
about computing it? Any ideas?

173
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,919
What if what if we were to replace this

174
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,080
uh 1 plus p with an x? Would would that

175
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:56,240
make it any any easier? So we've got uh

176
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:57,920
m + m x + m x^2

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,519
plus

178
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,640
mx to the n minus one.

179
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,640
Are people happier with this expression?

180
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,680
Getting getting some nods. Okay. Uh what

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,160
is it?

182
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,160
Anybody remember?

183
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah.

184
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:28,959
Yeah. It's a geometric series. Okay. So,

185
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,360
this is going to be m * uh

186
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,080
1 - x

187
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,440
uh oops

188
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,760
n over 1 - x.

189
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,320
Okay.

190
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:47,440
Uh, so you know, we knew this expression

191
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
already. How could we check it?

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
Or how how did you check it? I believe

193
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,600
you already have.

194
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Yeah.

195
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,680
Uh,

196
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,680
oh,

197
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,760
thank you.

198
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Uh

199
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
yeah.

200
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,440
Yeah, you're right. Thank you. So, um

201
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,560
how could you prove this? Or how how

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,800
would I have failed to prove it if I

203
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,160
tried to do it just now?

204
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,160
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,959
Okay,

206
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,320
so this is what we call the uh the guess

207
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,480
and check method. Okay, so if we've got

208
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,959
a sum

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
like this and we know or we can

210
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,399
reasonably guess a nice closed form for

211
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,120
it, right? Then you know we can prove it

212
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,440
by induction, right? That's that's

213
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,680
fairly straightforward. The hard part is

214
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,320
figuring out what that uh closed form

215
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,640
should be. Okay.

216
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,200
Uh and you know in this case the

217
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,959
inductive step you know it reduces to

218
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,240
you know some fairly simple algebra as

219
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,079
you already saw I think in I think in

220
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,079
recitation. Is that right? Recoach.

221
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
Okay. Even if you don't remember Zach

222
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
does.

223
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,839
Okay.

224
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
So, uh, how might we discover this this

225
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,120
closed form if we didn't already know

226
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,120
it, though? Any ideas?

227
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah.

228
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,880
Yeah. Exactly.

229
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,519
Okay. So this is what we call the

230
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,519
perturbation method.

231
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,200
So the answer was you know if we

232
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,800
multiply this entire thing by x and uh

233
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,720
you know subtract it then things will

234
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,160
cancel. Okay. Uh so this is uh one

235
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,279
example of what we call the perturbation

236
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,760
method. Um this is something that uh

237
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,760
does anybody know the story of um Gaus

238
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,240
in the kindergarten or first grade when

239
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,639
uh he was given a massive sum to

240
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
evaluate by his teacher and uh you know

241
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
3 seconds he uh gave the teacher his

242
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,399
answer and the teacher's like what the

243
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,120
hell no go back to your seat. Okay.

244
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah. So perturbation method in action.

245
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,120
So Gaus was asked to evaluate you know 1

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,120
+ 2 plus

247
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,800
I think the story was 100 not actually

248
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,440
sure and G observed that if you you know

249
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,200
take this series and perturb it a little

250
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,200
bit so in this case flip it around

251
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,240
and then add them together you end up

252
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,240
with something very nice Okay.

253
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Okay.

254
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,399
So he's got you know two copies of this

255
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
sum

256
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,120
right? So 2s is equal to this thing

257
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,639
which means that s should be equal to

258
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,920
that.

259
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,839
Okay so fairly straightforward. We can

260
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,079
do the same thing with this geometric

261
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,079
series here.

262
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,160
[Applause]

263
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:59,720
So for simplicity, I'm going to drop the

264
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,720
m. So if instead we have s = 1 + x + x^2

265
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,360
+ x nus1

266
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,920
and uh your your colleague said that we

267
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,440
should multiply this by x. So xs equals

268
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,519
I'm going to shift everything over so

269
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,680
it's a little bit easier to see what's

270
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,680
going on.

271
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,320
Okay.

272
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,880
And now this time instead of adding them

273
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,880
we're going to want to subtract.

274
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
This one doesn't have anything uh to

275
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,800
subtract.

276
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,959
Uh, and now here we've got, you know,

277
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,440
plus x - x plus x^2 - x^2. So everything

278
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,440
is going to cancel

279
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,120
until we get to the end. And here we've

280
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:54,000
got - x n.

281
00:14:49,120 --> 00:15:00,480
Okay, so now we've got s - x s is equal

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:05,839
to 1 - x to the n, which means that s is

283
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,240
1 - x n over 1 - x.

284
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,880
Okay,

285
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,959
so if we, you know, didn't know the the

286
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,399
formula for a geometric series off the

287
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,880
top of our heads, which, you know, I

288
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,880
clearly didn't, we could derive it like

289
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,360
this and then we can check it by

290
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,360
induction. Okay, does that make sense to

291
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
everybody?

292
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,839
So if we go back to our annuity example,

293
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:45,360
we had uh so m was

294
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:48,959
50k, n is 20 years.

295
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,320
uh P was

296
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,920
uh 0533

297
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:00,040
which means that our X here was uh was

298
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,040
it 1 over 1 - P

299
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,360
1 over one uh 1 + P.

300
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,839
Okay. So if we plug this in, it turns

301
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,880
out that uh the value of our annuity is

302
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,680
actually about

303
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,560
638,000.

304
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,320
Okay,

305
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,160
so

306
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,839
you know, it's it's not just less than

307
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,040
the $1 million that we were promised.

308
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,560
It's like substantially less, right?

309
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,920
Okay.

310
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,839
And uh

311
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,920
you know what what if we uh what if we

312
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,079
took an even more extreme example like

313
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,720
suppose instead of uh 50,000 per year

314
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,720
for 20 years we got $1 per year for a

315
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,839
million years. You know for simplicity

316
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,839
let's just say it's forever. Okay. So

317
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,519
suppose we got $1 forever like every

318
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,519
year forever. How much is that worth?

319
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,640
Half a million.

320
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:13,199
100,000. Yeah.

321
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,919
Yeah, it's about 20 bucks. Uh so this uh

322
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,400
this x to the n just goes to zero. Turns

323
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:24,240
out that if we have uh m = 1, n is

324
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,160
infinity. Same p as we had before,

325
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,679
it's about 20. Okay. So, you know, it

326
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,000
might be a little bit counterintuitive

327
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:37,760
that uh you know, getting money like

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,919
forever, it's still has finite value,

329
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,360
right? Um but

330
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,080
yeah, I don't know. Maybe if you think

331
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:50,320
about it, it it uh it kind of makes

332
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,000
sense, right? Um like that that money

333
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
that you're getting like n years from

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,360
now, like you know, who cares? Like

335
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,600
you're you're not even going to be alive

336
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,520
to use it, right? So maybe it maybe it

337
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,280
also kind of makes sense that it uh that

338
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,080
it doesn't it's not worth very much.

339
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,320
Uh and you know in the real world there

340
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,600
are actually you know perpetual

341
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,400
annuities like this. They they do exist.

342
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,039
Um I believe there is a surviving one uh

343
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,760
issued by a Dutch water company in the

344
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,160
17th century. Uh I think they issued

345
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:29,200
five that are still around today. And

346
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:32,000
one was acquired by Yale in uh let's see

347
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,440
maybe 30 odd years ago I think uh for

348
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,440
$24,000 and it gets them about $12

349
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,679
annually. So uh only worth it for the uh

350
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,039
historical value. The uh the money is is

351
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,039
a complete wash.

352
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,039
Okay.

353
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,679
So, are people reasonably happy with the

354
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,240
uh perturbation method?

355
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,559
Yeah, some thumbs up.

356
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,520
Okay, so let's move on to a slightly

357
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,679
different method for evaluating, you

358
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,280
know, other sums.

359
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,200
Uh

360
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,200
so this is what's called the MSAT

361
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,880
method.

362
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm spelling this correctly. I hope so.

363
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,760
uh or if you don't like German I think

364
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,679
it is uh you could also just call it the

365
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:30,320
educated guess method. Okay.

366
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:33,360
So suppose we have the following sum

367
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,720
sum from k = 1

368
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:41,120
to n of k^ squ.

369
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,200
Okay.

370
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,280
So first does does anybody already know

371
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,600
the answer? What what does this sum

372
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,600
evaluate to?

373
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,720
Oh nobody. Okay, in that case uh next

374
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,720
question is open to everyone. Uh does

375
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,760
anybody have any idea like what vaguely

376
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,760
the solution might look like?

377
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,320
Like yeah.

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, it should it should be some sort

379
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,480
of cubic, right? Like we're we're

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,760
summing up a bunch of squares. Well, n

381
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,080
squares. Um, a bunch of them are, you

382
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,799
know, about n^2. And so we should get

383
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,520
something that's about n cubed. Okay. So

384
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:32,240
guess

385
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:36,400
uh s is you know approximately

386
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,640
n cubed. Okay. Now it won't do us too

387
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,080
much good to uh you know put that into

388
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,080
our guess and check method. Yeah.

389
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:54,480
Uh intuition basically. Um

390
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,200
but uh so what one way you could think

391
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,880
about it is uh so half of these terms

392
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:07,520
are going to be larger than n /2

393
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,840
right? So that's 1/4 of n^2. Uh you've

394
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,840
got n /2 of those. So you should have

395
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,760
something that's at least 1/8 of n

396
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,760
cubed. Does that make sense?

397
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Uh and then for an upper bound, right,

398
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
you've got n terms which are all at most

399
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,200
n^2. And so it's going to be, you know,

400
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,600
something between 1/8 n cubed and n

401
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,080
cubed itself.

402
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,919
Does that kind of make sense?

403
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,360
or hinting at something else that we'll

404
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,840
do uh a little bit later. Uh if you

405
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,080
squint really hard, a sum kind of looks

406
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,760
like an integral.

407
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,840
So if you integrate that, you're going

408
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,360
to get something that looks like nubed.

409
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,360
Okay. Uh another question.

410
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:03,360
Yeah. Uh we could do that if you like.

411
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,679
So we've got, you know, 1 + uh 2^ 2 + 3^

412
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,480
2 +

413
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,080
uh n / 2

414
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,039
squared

415
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,120
plus all the way up to n^2,

416
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,679
right? So these terms, you know, plus or

417
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,960
minus one term if it's, you know, even

418
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,120
or odd. So these are all greater than or

419
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,200
equal to uh

420
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,159
n /2 squared and we've got n over2 of

421
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,080
them or n /2 + 1 or whatever. Okay, so

422
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,559
the sum is going to be at least

423
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,039
n /2

424
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:46,480
* n /2

425
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:49,600
is 1/8 n cubed. Okay.

426
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,159
Yeah. Question.

427
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
Yeah.

428
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,679
[Music]

429
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,039
Ah, okay. So, uh, we're getting a a more

430
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,880
refined guess. Um, though actually I

431
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,799
would argue that n cubed is already good

432
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,679
enough uh for for what we're doing

433
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,520
anyway. Um,

434
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,440
and here's why. So, we we as as we said

435
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,080
like we it's not very precise, right?

436
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
like we don't know uh like you said the

437
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,520
leading coefficient should probably be a

438
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,080
third. Um but we're just going to start

439
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,760
from you know guessing that it's a cubic

440
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,240
of some sort. Okay, we don't know

441
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
anything about the coefficients

442
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,840
but you know it seems like a reasonable

443
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
guess.

444
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,440
Okay,

445
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:49,840
so we're going to say that s is equal to

446
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:52,640
a * n cubed + b n^ 2 + cn

447
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,799
plus d.

448
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,720
Okay, we're just going to take that on

449
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,320
faith, assume it, and see where it leads

450
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,000
us.

451
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,960
Okay,

452
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,880
so if we assume that, what can we

453
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,120
deduce?

454
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,120
Any ideas?

455
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,279
How might we go about figuring out what

456
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,279
A, B, C, and D should be?

457
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,440
Well, what if we look at you know small

458
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,360
n?

459
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,360
So if we have say n equals 0,

460
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,919
what happens if we put in n equals 0?

461
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:51,760
Exactly.

462
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:58,640
Okay. So then we have uh a * 0 cubed + b

463
00:24:51,760 --> 00:25:01,279
* 0 2 + c * 0 + d = what?

464
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,279
What is the value of our sum at zero?

465
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,000
Zero. Yeah, we've just got the empty

466
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,000
sum.

467
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay.

468
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,720
What else can we do?

469
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,960
Yeah, n equals 1. That seems like

470
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,320
another decent choice.

471
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:31,360
And so this time we'll end up with a + b

472
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:35,200
+ c + d equals what?

473
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,200
What's the value of our sum there?

474
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,200
1.

475
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:52,159
And if we continue like this,

476
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:57,000
we get uh 8 a + 4 b + 2 c + d = 5. So 1

477
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,000
+ 4. Uh question.

478
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,880
Uh no, we're trying to figure those out.

479
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:07,559
So we're just taking it on faith that S

480
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,559
has this form. Okay.

481
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,760
Mhm. So we already know that because S

482
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,679
was defined as the sum of squares. Okay.

483
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,640
So if we sum up all of the squares up to

484
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,799
n equals 1, we get one. If we sum them

485
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,880
up to n equals 2, we get five. etc.

486
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,279
Okay,

487
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,279
is this enough?

488
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah, we need one more. So, let's put in

489
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:45,600
n equals 3.

490
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:48,480
Here we've got 27 a + 9 b + 3 c + d

491
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,039
= uh 14.

492
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,000
Can I arithmetic at least?

493
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,159
I think I can arithmetic. 1 plus 4 + 9.

494
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That sounds like 14.

495
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,880
Okay,

496
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,679
so now we've got a system of uh four

497
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,200
equations and four variables. So we

498
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,960
should be able to solve it. Okay.

499
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,440
Um has anybody figured out what the

500
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,440
solution is yet?

501
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Well, d equals 0. That's an easy one. Uh

502
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:29,880
I think it turns out to be a =3

503
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:29,880
b = 12 c = 16. Is that right?

504
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,000
And uh yeah, d equ= 0 because we've got

505
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,000
a bunch of zeros here.

506
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,120
Okay.

507
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,840
So are we done?

508
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,840
Have we found our solution?

509
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,080
Yeah.

510
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,760
Yeah. So, we we've maybe found our

511
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,640
solution, but you know, we we don't

512
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,279
know. We just pulled this out of a hat

513
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,679
and assumed it. Okay. So, we should

514
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:09,000
actually prove that this is correct. So

515
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,000
now we're going to take uh you know s=

516
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:19,039
1/3 n cubed + uh 12 n^2 + 16 n and use

517
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,880
that as our guess and go back to the

518
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:26,240
guess and check method and prove this by

519
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,360
induction. Okay. And uh

520
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,000
we're actually going to want strong

521
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,679
induction. These are our base cases.

522
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,279
We've already proven that essentially

523
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,880
like that's what we use to derive ABC

524
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,880
and D. Okay? And our inductive step is

525
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,159
just going to be a bunch of algebra. So

526
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,360
I'm I'm not going to go into that right

527
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,799
now, but uh yeah, if you're interested,

528
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,480
feel free to prove it.

529
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,760
Okay.

530
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,600
Uh yeah, and uh if it works, we'll, you

531
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,080
know, we'll have a proof that our uh

532
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,360
that our formula was correct. And if it

533
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,520
doesn't, you know, we go back to the

534
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,159
drawing board. we uh we know that this

535
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,080
form was wrong and so maybe we try and

536
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,360
figure out you know a different form

537
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,080
that that our answer might take. Okay.

538
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,480
Uh does that make sense? Are people

539
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,480
happy with that?

540
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,799
Any questions? Maybe I should phrase it

541
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,799
the other way.

542
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,799
What's your name?

543
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,799
Oh, I'm Bmore.

544
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,360
Uh, like the Pennsylvania College. Same

545
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,360
word spelled differently.

546
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,200
Uh, I saw another hand over here. Was

547
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,200
that was that a question or

548
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,279
Yeah. So that that's if you if you solve

549
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,440
this system of equations uh like that's

550
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,960
that's what comes out like you you could

551
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,559
do Gaussian elimination or you know

552
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,559
invert the matrix or whatever.

553
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,080
on your notes.

554
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,720
Oh, no. I'm I'm not that good.

555
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,480
Oh, I mean, no, I totally don't have it

556
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,000
on my notes. Um,

557
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,000
yeah. Yeah. Question.

558
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,399
Yeah. Uh so as as we were discussing you

559
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,159
know before we we dove into it right uh

560
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,399
we think that it's probably going to

561
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,240
look something like n cubed um we don't

562
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,799
know exactly you know how close it is to

563
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,159
that but it's kind of reasonable to

564
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,320
assume that it's a polinomial like a

565
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,840
cubic polinomial

566
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,399
um so you know maybe we could have

567
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,520
started with uh you know something like

568
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,520
this instead head

569
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,039
like maybe it's some constant time n

570
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,559
cubed plus you know quadratic term and

571
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,760
then you know the onsance method would

572
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,000
have failed we would have uh uh we would

573
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,039
have ended up with you know suspicious

574
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,159
looking guess we would have tried to

575
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,919
prove it by induction and it wouldn't

576
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:15,640
have worked

577
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,640
um but yeah as it turns out uh

578
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,440
this is a reasonable

579
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Yeah.

580
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,799
How do we know that means it's wrong?

581
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,480
What if we just didn't figure out the

582
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,200
right way?

583
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,799
Ah, so the the question is if we have a

584
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,640
bad guess and we can't prove it by

585
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,720
induction, how do we know that the guess

586
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,159
is actually wrong and not that uh you

587
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,880
know we're doing something suspicious

588
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,200
with the proof? Uh so that's a good

589
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,679
question. Um,

590
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,399
so maybe I should digress here a little

591
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,399
bit. Uh, if you're trying to, you know,

592
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,240
figure out a proof or a disproof

593
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,440
disproof for a statement that you're not

594
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,200
quite sure whether it's true or not, uh,

595
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,080
often the thing that you'll want to do

596
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,240
is attempt to prove it, see where your

597
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,919
proof seems to be breaking, like if you

598
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,000
if you find a block, like something that

599
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,880
you can't figure out, and then try and

600
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,720
use that to to generate disproof.

601
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,279
uh and then you know you can iterate on

602
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,679
that and uh you know if your if your

603
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,080
disproof gets stuck somewhere like maybe

604
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,919
you try and use that uh that block to

605
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,240
try and come up with a different proof.

606
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,919
Okay. Um and you know eventually

607
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,679
hopefully you'll be able to come up with

608
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:39,840
one or the other. Uh so in this case um

609
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:42,640
there's a a you know fairly uh clear uh

610
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:47,279
path towards a disproof you know put in

611
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:50,480
more numbers right so

612
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,080
we could try you know n= 4

613
00:32:50,480 --> 00:33:01,200
right

614
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:05,120
uh then we'd have 64 a + 16 b + 4 c + D

615
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,640
should be equal to what is it? 30.

616
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Okay, so that's a decent sanity check,

617
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,720
right? Like if that doesn't work, then

618
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,919
you know we know that we've uh we've

619
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:20,039
screwed something up. Okay, does that

620
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,039
make sense to everybody? Yeah. Question.

621
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,240
Uh so that's because we have uh four

622
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,440
variables here. We've got a b c and d.

623
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,440
So we needed four uh equations like four

624
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,440
constraints.

625
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,840
Yeah. Like we could equally well have

626
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,679
chosen like n= 1, n= 2, n= 5 and n= 100.

627
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,640
Uh it would have given us the correct

628
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,120
answer. It just would have taken more uh

629
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,120
complicated computation.

630
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Yeah.

631
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,320
Uh

632
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,320
oh. Here you mean?

633
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh, okay. So the the the squared term is

634
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,280
right because you know each of these

635
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,879
terms here is at least n over2 squ. Uh

636
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,480
the last term is because there are n

637
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,119
over2 of them and we're trying to

638
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,040
evaluate the sum.

639
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,839
So we're summing up n over2 things that

640
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,839
are all at least n over2.

641
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,240
They're at least zero. We don't care.

642
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,240
Yeah.

643
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,200
Okay. Are people reasonably happy with

644
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,520
this?

645
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,520
Yeah. Okay. So, let's move on to a third

646
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,520
technique.

647
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,760
Okay, so sometimes we're going to end up

648
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,359
with uh you know sums of sums, right? Uh

649
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,599
nested summations which we call double

650
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:32,960
sums. So for instance, what if we had

651
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:35,359
the following? So i = 1 to n of the sum

652
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,200
from j = 1

653
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,680
to i of j.

654
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,800
Okay.

655
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,040
So now you know before we had uh the

656
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,160
thing inside our sum

657
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,599
was this nice simple expression k^ squ

658
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,200
right now our sum and is itself a

659
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,800
summation.

660
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,920
Okay what can we do about that? How

661
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,920
would we evaluate things like this?

662
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,599
Mhm.

663
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,960
Yeah. So the answer was to evaluate the

664
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,000
inner sum first right figure out a

665
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,359
closed form as a function of I right and

666
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,280
then we can evaluate the outer sum okay

667
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,880
so in this case what do we end up with

668
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,880
what happens when we evaluate this inner

669
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,880
sum

670
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,680
I claim that this is something that we

671
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,240
already know how to do something that

672
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,240
we've seen for

673
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:52,400
yeah exactly

674
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:57,359
so this is the sum from i = 1 to n of i

675
00:36:52,400 --> 00:37:00,359
* i + 1 all divided by 2

676
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,359
okay

677
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,320
now how could we evaluate this sum this

678
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,440
this expression is a little bit more

679
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
complicated than the ones that we had

680
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,320
before Right.

681
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,320
Is there a way that we can simplify it?

682
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Yeah.

683
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,040
Mhm.

684
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:27,079
Yeah. So, let's uh distribute this i and

685
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,079
then break the sum up. Okay. So,

686
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,280
uh if we distribute this, we end up with

687
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,079
i^ 2 + i

688
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,839
/ 2. Okay.

689
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:43,359
And now we've got a sum of you know a

690
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,599
sum uh so we can split it into two

691
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,599
different summations

692
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,560
i = 1 to n

693
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,560
i^2 plus

694
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,040
sum of i.

695
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,720
Okay,

696
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,320
so I've taken each of these terms and

697
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,359
split it into its own sum and also

698
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,880
pulled this factor of 1/2 out in front.

699
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,119
Okay,

700
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,920
so this is now something that we know

701
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,920
how to evaluate. We just evaluated it.

702
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,760
Uh this is also something we know how to

703
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,160
evaluate like also we just evaluated it.

704
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,119
Uh

705
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,040
so this comes out to

706
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:34,079
the answer that we had there. So

707
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,599
16 n cubed

708
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,160
+

709
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,160
1/4 n^2

710
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,560
+ 112n

711
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,560
uh plus

712
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:57,880
14 * n * n + 1. Okay.

713
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,320
Does that make sense to everybody?

714
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,800
Suppose instead

715
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,800
we had something similar but slightly

716
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
different.

717
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:39,760
So sum from i + 1 to n

718
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:42,760
sum from j = i to n of j.

719
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Oops.

720
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,960
Okay. So our inner sum now instead of

721
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,280
going from uh one to i, it's going from

722
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,280
i to n.

723
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Okay.

724
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,520
Now, we could evaluate this in the same

725
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,119
way as as we just did,

726
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,640
but it turns out that there's a slightly

727
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:16,040
easier way. Okay, we can exchange the

728
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,040
order of summation.

729
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,720
Okay. And what I mean by that is that we

730
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,760
want the outer sum to be in terms of J

731
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,760
and the inner sum to be in terms of I.

732
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Okay.

733
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:54,119
So

734
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,119
what are the possible values of J?

735
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,800
So uh yes.

736
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,240
Yeah.

737
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,240
Yeah. Oh.

738
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Yeah.

739
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,839
Okay, so if I equals 1 here, J equals I,

740
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,680
J equals 1. Okay, so that's the smallest

741
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,680
value of J.

742
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,680
And you know, J can clearly go up to N.

743
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,680
Okay.

744
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,839
Okay.

745
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,520
What are the bounds of summation on our

746
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,520
inner sum?

747
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,240
How would we compute this?

748
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,880
What constraints do we have on i and J

749
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,880
originally?

750
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,240
And we know that 1 is less than or equal

751
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,040
to i less than or equal to n. i less

752
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,560
than or equal to j less than or equal to

753
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,359
n.

754
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,400
Okay.

755
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,160
So we could you know phrase this as 1

756
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,240
less than or equal to i less than or

757
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,240
equal to j less than or equal to n.

758
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,359
Okay. And now we've got bounds on i in

759
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,359
terms of j.

760
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,119
Does that make sense to everybody?

761
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,800
So, we still want the sum over the same

762
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,359
set of pairs I and J. We're just

763
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,359
expressing it differently.

764
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,119
And now our sumand is the same.

765
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,160
Okay. Does it does it make sense to

766
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,160
everybody how we got this?

767
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,160
Yeah.

768
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,319
Uh so this right

769
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,920
just came from the bounds on our inner

770
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,240
sum.

771
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,359
Okay. We're saying that J should range

772
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,359
from I up to N.

773
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,520
Okay.

774
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,280
And so then we just, you know, stick

775
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,640
this pair of inequalities in here.

776
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,400
Okay. Does that make sense to everybody?

777
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,000
You reasonably happy with this?

778
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,599
Okay.

779
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,119
So now we've exchanged the order of

780
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,720
summation.

781
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,800
We've got uh J for our outer sum, I for

782
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,960
inner sum,

783
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,400
and now we've got a much simpler sum

784
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:02,119
here that we can easily evaluate. Okay.

785
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,119
What is our inner sum?

786
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,839
Mhm.

787
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,839
Yeah.

788
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:24,480
Okay.

789
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,040
The sumand has no dependence on the uh

790
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,960
index of summation.

791
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,800
Right. So we've just got J terms. All of

792
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,800
them are J. So it's J squ.

793
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Okay.

794
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,280
And now this is just the sum that we had

795
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
before.

796
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,960
Does that make sense to everybody?

797
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,440
Yeah.

798
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Mhm.

799
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,680
Uh this one

800
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,599
here.

801
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,800
Uh so that's that's just uh an

802
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,240
expression that you've already seen,

803
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,240
right? We we've already seen how to

804
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,319
evaluate the sum from J= 1 to I of of J.

805
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,640
Uh so that's just you know plugging in

806
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,640
that closed formula uh for that inner

807
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,640
sum.

808
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,839
Okay. Are people reasonably happy with

809
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,839
this?

810
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,040
Yeah.

811
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,800
Uh did we

812
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,960
uh

813
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,960
oh yeah here is

814
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,599
I mean here it's the you know particular

815
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,599
example where where n equals 100 but

816
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,599
yeah

817
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,400
okay so why don't we move on to The uh

818
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,959
last topic for today.

819
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,959
[Applause]

820
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,920
So what happens

821
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,400
if we have the following sum?

822
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Any

823
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,760
idea how we might come up with a closed

824
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,040
form for this?

825
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,040
Does anybody already know a closed form?

826
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,240
Nobody really.

827
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,359
That's good because it's an open

828
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,720
problem. Um,

829
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,400
well, I suppose that doesn't make it

830
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,440
good. If you have a closed form, you

831
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,119
could write a paper about it. That would

832
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,280
be pretty exciting.

833
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,960
Uh okay. So it turns out that you know

834
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,920
there isn't any nice close form for this

835
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,680
as far as we know. Uh so does that mean

836
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,920
we should just you know hands in the air

837
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,920
give up?

838
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,560
Getting some getting some nods. Yeah. I

839
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,440
mean I suppose that's a that's a

840
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,119
question of philosophy. Um but you know

841
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,440
we can still say something about it

842
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,960
right? like maybe we don't need to know

843
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,319
exactly what this sum is. Uh but you

844
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,760
know, as long as we figure out something

845
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,640
that's close enough, maybe we're still

846
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:54,200
happy. Okay, so maybe we want to

847
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,200
approximate it.

848
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Okay.

849
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,040
So, can anybody give me

850
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,040
a guess as to an approximation for this

851
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,040
sum?

852
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,160
Mhm.

853
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,000
So the answer was, you know, again, if

854
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,880
we squint really hard and pretend that

855
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,480
this is an integral, maybe s is

856
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,160
approximately equal to the integral of

857
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,960
rootx

858
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:42,880
dx uh say from 1 to n, which is going to

859
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,119
be

860
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:51,040
about

861
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:53,280
2/3 uh n to the is it three halves? Is

862
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,599
that about right?

863
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:00,160
I swear I've done calculus before. Um,

864
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:03,200
it's been a while. Uh, okay.

865
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:07,079
So, the question then becomes,

866
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,079
how close is that approximation?

867
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,359
Do we think we're, you know, within a

868
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,640
factor of two? Do you think we're off

869
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:18,960
by, you know, n by root n off by one?

870
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,240
Maybe

871
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,240
it's not entirely clear. Okay.

872
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,240
So,

873
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:33,319
in order to figure this out, we're going

874
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,319
to use what we call the integral method.

875
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,040
So,

876
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:46,000
give me a moment to draw this.

877
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:48,319
And you know,

878
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,520
Redux looks a little bit like that if

879
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,520
you squint really hard.

880
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,000
Okay.

881
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:06,599
Um

882
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,599
so suppose we have a weekly increasing

883
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,559
function of x.

884
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,839
So rootx is indeed weakly increasing. So

885
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,599
that that'll work.

886
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,240
Um

887
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,000
now recall remon sums from uh from

888
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,920
integral calculus. Okay.

889
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,119
No no post-traumatic stress. Are we are

890
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,960
we okay? Okay. Uh so how could we how

891
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,720
could we approximate

892
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,720
uh the integral of f ofx

893
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,960
yeah

894
00:50:53,359 --> 00:51:02,319
yeah so if we've got one 2 3 4 dot dot

895
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:06,160
dot

896
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:09,160
we can draw a bunch of rectangles like

897
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,160
this.

898
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,720
Okay. And this step function here.

899
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,079
Actually, maybe I should get a different

900
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,079
color.

901
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,240
Okay,

902
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,240
for completeness maybe I should do that.

903
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,119
Okay,

904
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,079
so this this step function here that

905
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:01,599
I've drawn is uh f of the floor of x,

906
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,599
right? f is weekly increasing.

907
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,119
So that means

908
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,160
you know floor of x is an under

909
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,480
approximation for x. So f of floor of x

910
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,040
is an under approximation

911
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,040
for f ofx.

912
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,359
Okay.

913
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,480
Now what happens if we integrate the

914
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,480
step function?

915
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,960
What is the integral

916
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,119
from 1 to n

917
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:56,079
of f of floor of x? Yeah,

918
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,359
sorry.

919
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,359
uh almost.

920
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:12,800
So in in this case it actually does it

921
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,800
turn out to be s

922
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,800
uh

923
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,000
yeah exactly we're we're missing a term

924
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,760
here.

925
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,160
Okay,

926
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,839
so we can break this into n minus one

927
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,079
integrals,

928
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:32,079
right? We've got a an interval of width

929
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,960
n minus one.

930
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:38,640
Uh this is constant on each of those uh

931
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,400
width one uh sub intervals, right? So we

932
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,480
can break it break it apart into a whole

933
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,480
bunch of rectangles.

934
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:50,720
So this is going to be the sum from i =

935
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,559
1 to n minus one

936
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,119
of

937
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,000
f of i.

938
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:02,720
Does that make sense to everybody?

939
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,480
So we've got intervals of width one. Uh

940
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,960
our function is constant on each of

941
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,839
those intervals, right? And it's equal

942
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,319
to, you know, the left hand uh the left

943
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:16,359
hand side of that interval.

944
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,359
Okay, does that make sense to everybody?

945
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:25,960
And this is just going to be s minus

946
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,960
uh f of n.

947
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,200
Okay.

948
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,200
Yeah.

949
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,200
Sorry.

950
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:42,559
Uh so the question is why are we using n

951
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,720
minus one as the bound here? Okay, so

952
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:48,559
that's because the width of this

953
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:52,880
interval is n minus one. We're splitting

954
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:57,119
into n minus one intervals of width one.

955
00:54:52,880 --> 00:55:01,760
Okay, so for instance, if we uh you know

956
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,920
went up to say n= 5.

957
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,000
Okay.

958
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,599
So if we were trying to sum f of one, f

959
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
of two, f of three, f of four, f of

960
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:16,520
five, uh we would then want to compare

961
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,520
to this integral here.

962
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:26,760
So the integral from 1 to 5, right? And

963
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,760
this gives us four rectangles,

964
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,760
right? We've got the interval from 1 to

965
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:38,000
2, from 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5.

966
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:41,839
Okay. And the uh the interval say from 2

967
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,359
to three has width 1 and height f of

968
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,880
two.

969
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:52,400
Okay. So you know maybe we could phrase

970
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:54,240
this as you know 1 * f of i. Does that

971
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,240
make sense?

972
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,240
Okay.

973
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:04,359
So now we've you know we've got uh

974
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,319
so we've got an under approximation for

975
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:15,440
our integral now. So uh I haven't

976
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:18,240
actually written the the integral.

977
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:22,640
So let's let

978
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:27,760
I equal the integral from 1 to n

979
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:29,280
fx dx. Okay,

980
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,520
so

981
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,280
we said that this function here under

982
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:39,119
approximates f, right? So this integral

983
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:42,319
under approximates i.

984
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:46,559
So that tells us that i

985
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:48,799
is greater than or equal to s minus

986
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,799
f of n.

987
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,799
Okay.

988
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,119
Now, equivalently, we could phrase this

989
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,559
as a bound on S in terms of I, right?

990
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:03,040
Because S was what we originally wanted

991
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:05,040
to figure out. Okay? So, instead, we

992
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:09,200
could write this as S is less than or

993
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:14,119
equal to I plus

994
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,119
F of N. Does that make sense?

995
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,160
Okay.

996
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,599
Now

997
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:31,319
what if instead

998
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,319
we over approximated?

999
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:48,200
Okay,

1000
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:48,200
so now we've got f of the ceiling of x.

1001
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,440
Sorry.

1002
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:04,000
So the new step function that I've just

1003
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:06,480
drawn in green is f of ceiling of x

1004
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,960
which is an over approximation for f

1005
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,480
ofx.

1006
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:15,119
Okay. So if we integrate it, the

1007
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,359
integral from 1 to n

1008
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,680
of f

1009
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:21,440
of ceiling of x

1010
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:26,680
dx

1011
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,680
should be greater than or equal to i.

1012
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,480
Okay.

1013
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,599
Now doing exactly the same thing as we

1014
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:39,160
had before.

1015
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,160
What is this integral?

1016
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,319
Yeah.

1017
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:59,359
Yeah.

1018
00:58:53,359 --> 00:59:03,000
So sum from i = 2 to n of f of i

1019
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:03,000
say times 1,

1020
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:10,760
right?

1021
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,760
And this is just sus f of one.

1022
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,760
Okay.

1023
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:23,680
So s minus f of one is at least i.

1024
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:26,079
Once again we can rephrase this as a

1025
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,160
bound on i or sorry a bound on s in

1026
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:32,760
terms of i.

1027
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,760
So I uh sorry S

1028
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:41,720
is greater than or equal to

1029
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,720
I + F of 1.

1030
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,200
Okay, does that make sense to everybody?

1031
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:08,400
So putting these together now

1032
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:11,680
we have

1033
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,240
I + f of 1

1034
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:19,760
less than or equal to s less than or

1035
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:22,760
equal to i + f of n.

1036
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Okay.

1037
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,520
So this is what we call the integral

1038
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,520
bound for increasing functions.

1039
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:10,319
Are people reasonably happy with this?

1040
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:12,400
Okay. So if we go back to our original

1041
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:15,280
question, you know, where f ofx equals

1042
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,240
rootx, right? What are the bounds we

1043
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,839
get?

1044
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,839
What is i first?

1045
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,440
wasn't quite what I wrote down before.

1046
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,440
Yeah,

1047
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:38,960
it is from 1 to n. Remember what I wrote

1048
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:43,400
originally was uh 2/3 n^ 3 which is I

1049
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,400
believe the integral from 0 to n.

1050
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,960
So

1051
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:57,680
what we actually have here is

1052
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:59,920
I = the integral from 1 to n of x^ 12 dx

1053
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:03,040
which is

1054
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:07,839
equal to 2/3

1055
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:15,520
x^ 3s evaluated

1056
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:17,599
at one and n which is going to be 2/3 *

1057
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,000
n^ 3

1058
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,000
- 1.

1059
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,680
Okay, so almost what we had before.

1060
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:36,559
So our lower bound then is this value

1061
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:40,160
plus f of one, right? f of one is just

1062
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:44,160
root one. it's one

1063
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:47,680
and our upper bound is I plus roo<unk>

1064
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:51,200
n. Okay,

1065
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:53,599
so it turns out that 2/3 n^ 3 halves is

1066
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,640
a pretty good approximation,

1067
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:59,760
right? It's uh you know it's going to be

1068
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,240
a little bit larger than that but not

1069
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,480
much, right? we're going to be within an

1070
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,799
additive root n.

1071
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:12,079
Okay. And you know given that our

1072
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:15,520
approximation is you know a cube of that

1073
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:19,920
that's actually pretty good.

1074
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:24,039
Okay. Does that make sense to everybody?

1075
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,039
Are we reasonably happy with that?

1076
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,960
Okay.

1077
01:03:49,680 --> 01:04:01,319
What if instead we had you know s equals

1078
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:01,319
sum from i = 1 to n of say 1 / i.

1079
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,400
Can we apply our integral bound to this?

1080
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,440
It thinks yes.

1081
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,839
Who thinks no?

1082
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,680
Okay. Can anybody explain why in either

1083
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:24,680
direction?

1084
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,680
Yeah.

1085
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:44,480
Uh okay. So the answer was uh you know

1086
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:48,839
after one uh it's going to converge.

1087
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,839
Uh I would dispute that.

1088
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,839
Yeah.

1089
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,400
Okay.

1090
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,559
Okay. Fair enough.

1091
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:08,240
So even if we could apply the integral

1092
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,240
bound, it may not get us very far.

1093
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,680
Uh I think there's a bigger problem

1094
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,799
here. Yeah,

1095
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,559
that's right. So

1096
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,520
remember that our assumption, right, was

1097
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:28,280
that f should be weekly increasing.

1098
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:28,280
One over i is not or 1 /x is not. Yeah.

1099
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,280
Yeah.

1100
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,760
Okay.

1101
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,400
So the observation here is that if we

1102
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:43,480
take f ofx

1103
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,480
= 1 /x this is weekly decreasing.

1104
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:54,240
So we can do something similar.

1105
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:58,680
Okay, what exactly are we going to do?

1106
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,680
Well, let's take g of x

1107
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:13,000
to be equal to f of n + 1 - x.

1108
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,039
Okay.

1109
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,200
Now, what do we know about g?

1110
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:40,559
So basically what we've done here,

1111
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,559
right, we are essentially negating the

1112
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,480
argument. So we're kind of flipping it

1113
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,640
horizontally,

1114
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,640
right? We started with a weekly

1115
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,799
decreasing function.

1116
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,319
So when we flip it like this, we're

1117
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:55,200
going to end up with a weekly increasing

1118
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,200
function.

1119
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,920
Okay. Yeah.

1120
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,799
Ah. Uh, so are you worried about the n

1121
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,799
plus one as opposed to the n?

1122
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,799
Yeah.

1123
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:27,200
Okay. So basically we are mapping uh one

1124
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,960
to n and vice versa

1125
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,680
and then everything in between should

1126
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,240
just you know interpolate linearly.

1127
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,720
Okay. So if we put you know one into

1128
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,880
here we end up with f of n. If we put n

1129
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,520
into here we end up with f of one. Does

1130
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,440
that make sense? So the question is why

1131
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,920
do we have the uh n plus one there

1132
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,559
instead of just an n or a minus x or

1133
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,640
something like that?

1134
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:55,960
which you know kind of gets into the the

1135
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,960
next question. What is S in terms of G?

1136
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:17,199
So maybe it would be better to write it

1137
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,880
using ellipses instead of sigma

1138
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:24,719
notation.

1139
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:31,000
So we defined it as f of 1 plus f of 2

1140
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:31,000
plus dot dot dot plus f of n.

1141
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:34,799
Okay.

1142
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,799
Now how can we rewrite this in terms of

1143
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,799
g?

1144
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,040
Yeah.

1145
01:08:52,880 --> 01:09:02,120
Okay, so this is actually equal to the

1146
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,120
sum of G of I same balance.

1147
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,120
Okay.

1148
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,400
So now what can we do?

1149
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,960
Mhm.

1150
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,480
Yeah, G satisfies all of the uh

1151
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,799
requirements that we needed for our

1152
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:30,239
integral bound. Okay, so we can apply

1153
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:32,719
the integral bound now to G instead of

1154
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,239
to our original F.

1155
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:37,480
Okay.

1156
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:37,480
So now

1157
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:44,400
uh we know that

1158
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:46,880
I + g of 1

1159
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:51,759
less than or equal to s less than or

1160
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:53,839
equal to i + g of n.

1161
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,600
Okay.

1162
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:58,400
So the integral is exactly the same,

1163
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,560
right? We are, you know, we've just

1164
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,520
flipped it, right? But the area under it

1165
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:06,320
is is going to be the same.

1166
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:11,320
And what is this g of one? Well, this g

1167
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:11,320
of one is just f of n.

1168
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,719
g of n is just f of one.

1169
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,640
Okay,

1170
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,320
so this is the integral bound for weekly

1171
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,320
decreasing.

1172
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:43,800
F.

1173
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,800
Okay. Does that make sense to everybody?

1174
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,320
Yeah.

1175
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,400
Uh,

1176
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,400
strictly speaking,

1177
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,400
uh,

1178
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,760
Um

1179
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,159
so you end up with a uh a slightly

1180
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:16,920
different problem if you uh if you just

1181
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:16,920
negate it. Um

1182
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,480
which is

1183
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:28,719
well I'll hint at it in a moment. Okay.

1184
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:32,040
Uh what happens if you take limits as n

1185
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,040
goes to infinity?

1186
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,239
Pardon?

1187
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,920
Yeah. So you kind of have to um like you

1188
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,760
you can do that but you you'd have to

1189
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,120
kind of adjust for it and it doesn't

1190
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,480
work quite as nicely with the with

1191
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:52,560
limits. Uh so the answer is strictly

1192
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,480
speaking yes. You could negate it if you

1193
01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:00,000
want to.

1194
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:03,000
uh but uh you know flipping it and you

1195
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
know

1196
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,560
I personally find it easier to think

1197
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,560
about but

1198
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,960
yeah

1199
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:18,000
so that that that was the idea to to

1200
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,840
negate f instead of x.

1201
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,080
Okay.

1202
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:26,320
But uh yeah, segue into the uh the last

1203
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:30,719
thing. We've got a couple of minutes or

1204
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:33,600
eight minutes. Oh, nice. Um

1205
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:40,480
so what about s=

1206
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:42,320
sum from i = 1 to infinity of let's say

1207
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,880
because as somebody pointed out we do

1208
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:49,719
not want to be working with logs.

1209
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,719
So let's say 1 over i^2.

1210
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,440
Okay.

1211
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:02,199
So how could we evaluate this infinite

1212
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:02,199
sum?

1213
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:19,040
Well, we can basically do what we were

1214
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,199
just doing, right?

1215
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:23,199
So,

1216
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:28,360
well, does does anybody remember how we

1217
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:28,360
actually define what an infinite sum is?

1218
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,840
It's just going to be a limit of partial

1219
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,840
sums.

1220
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,360
Okay.

1221
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,560
Now all of these

1222
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,560
we know how to evaluate.

1223
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,560
Okay.

1224
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:06,400
So each of these if we take you know i

1225
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:13,840
subn to be equal to the integral from 1

1226
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:16,800
to n of 1 i^2 oh sorry 1x^2

1227
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:20,480
dx

1228
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,480
okay what is this integral

1229
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,480
Anybody

1230
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,760
want to evaluate that? No. We don't like

1231
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,440
calculus.

1232
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,440
Me too. That's why I'm asking for help.

1233
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,440
Yeah.

1234
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,760
Yeah. 1 - 1 / n. Okay.

1235
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:16,719
Why are you laughing at me? That's so

1236
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:19,120
rude. Ah, come on guys. Okay, so we know

1237
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,880
what these partial sums are or you know

1238
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:25,280
we have approximations for these partial

1239
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:28,800
sums. Okay, so the partial sum s subn is

1240
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:31,520
going to be bounded on one side by

1241
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:35,719
uh okay

1242
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,719
oops why don't I write it like this?

1243
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:44,640
So I subn plus f of n less than or equal

1244
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,120
to s subn less than or equal to i subn

1245
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,120
plus f of 1.

1246
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,120
Okay.

1247
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,920
Now what happens when we take limits?

1248
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:07,080
So weak inequalities are preserved by

1249
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:07,080
limits. Right? So the limit of

1250
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,920
I subn plus f of n

1251
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:21,199
is going to be less than or equal to s

1252
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:27,480
less than or equal to limit

1253
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:27,480
of i subn plus f of 1.

1254
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Okay.

1255
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,719
Now, what does the limit do?

1256
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:52,920
Well, we can separate these. What's the

1257
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,920
limit of I of subn?

1258
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,960
Yep.

1259
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,960
Mhm.

1260
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:07,920
uh 1 - 1 / infinity basically, right? So

1261
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:09,600
as n goes to infinity, this 1 / n term

1262
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,560
disappears.

1263
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,760
Okay, so

1264
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:20,199
this part is just going to be one.

1265
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,199
What's the limit of f of n?

1266
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,960
Yeah,

1267
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,840
also infinity. Uh

1268
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,800
also

1269
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,800
yeah zero

1270
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,960
less than or equal to s less than or

1271
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,679
equal to we just established that this

1272
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:43,320
is one.

1273
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,320
What's f of one?

1274
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,400
One.

1275
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,400
Okay.

1276
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:56,520
So we have an approximation.

1277
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,520
Is it a good one?

1278
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,080
I'm seeing some people like, "Yeah, good

1279
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,520
enough. Let's just go home." Some people

1280
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,880
like, "What the hell? We're off by a

1281
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:11,520
factor of two." Uh, yeah, it's between

1282
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,760
one and two. Like,

1283
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:17,000
not so great. Any ideas how we could

1284
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,000
make it better?

1285
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:25,480
How could we make our bones more

1286
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,480
precise?

1287
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:43,920
Maybe if we go back to the picture,

1288
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:46,920
it'll be a little bit uh easier to see.

1289
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,920
Okay.

1290
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,199
So

1291
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,760
this lack of precision is coming from

1292
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,000
the fact that like you know we're kind

1293
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,280
of looking at the difference between

1294
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,320
these two step functions, right? So the

1295
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:12,880
farther apart they are the the worse our

1296
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:16,400
our approximation is going to be. Okay.

1297
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:20,159
So if we kind of just forget about the

1298
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:22,800
first few terms, compute those exactly,

1299
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,760
and then just approximate the rest,

1300
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,000
we're going to end up with a more

1301
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:29,000
precise bound.

1302
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Okay?

1303
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:41,679
So if instead we say you know s =

1304
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:46,960
uh 1 + 14 + 1 9th

1305
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:48,560
plus the sum from i = 1 to infinity

1306
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,040
of

1307
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:56,520
1 /

1308
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:56,520
i + 3^ 2.

1309
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:04,120
Sorry, it's a bit crowded. Okay.

1310
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:11,080
Now, what happens if we approximate this

1311
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,080
sum?

1312
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,560
How close are we going to get?

1313
01:20:56,239 --> 01:21:00,679
Well, our error term remember

1314
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:08,480
was just

1315
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:12,560
the first term in our series.

1316
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:15,040
Okay, we are going to be between

1317
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,120
the integral and the integral plus the

1318
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:21,040
first term.

1319
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,880
Okay, here the first term is much

1320
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:26,880
smaller.

1321
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:30,239
Okay, so this time we've got uh what is

1322
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:33,600
it? 1 16.

1323
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:37,760
So instead of being, you know, between i

1324
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:42,480
and i + 1, we're now between i and i + 1

1325
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:46,480
over 16 for a different eye.

1326
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:48,080
Same I, no, different eye.

1327
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,600
Yeah.

1328
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:53,199
Okay. Does that make sense to everybody?

1329
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,800
So if you want a better approximation,

1330
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:57,840
just, you know, strip some terms off the

1331
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,760
front and approximate

1332
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,840
the tail of the sum instead of the

1333
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:05,360
entire thing.

1334
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:07,040
So that's all we have time for today. Uh

1335
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:09,199
let's see. I'm not sure who will see you

1336
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,880
next week. Um somebody will see you next

1337
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:14,239
week. Zach will see you next week. Uh

1338
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:20,840
feel free to come up if you have any

1339
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:20,840
questions. Yeah. started. Uh your role
