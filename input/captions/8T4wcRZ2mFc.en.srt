00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,440
Hi everyone, my name is Ena Maria and

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,759
I'm originally from Colombia. I'm also a

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,200
chair at Latinx Abroad and have been

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,599
working here at the Broad Institute for

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,599
the last seven years. Um I'm especially

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,519
happy to be here today introducing our

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,000
talk, especially as we're closing the

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,080
celebration for Hispanic Heritage Month.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,680
So before I start introducing our

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,560
guests, I just wanted to share a little

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,960
bit about the origins of this series and

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,359
what we at Latina Broad aim to achieve

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,359
through through these kind of talks. So

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,000
we started the series about three years

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,800
ago with two main goals in mind. Our

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,879
first one was representation because we

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,280
truly believe that it's important to see

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,440
ourselves reflected in science. Um

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,680
representation remind us that we belong

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,079
in these spaces that our voices and

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,000
perspectives matter and hopefully it

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
keeps spiring Latino scientists to

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,520
continue pursuing their passions. So

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,320
since we got we began in early 2022, we

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,480
had had over 30 speakers all over from

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
Latin America and the US and they all

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
come from a wide range of fields and

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
different stages of their career. So we

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,080
had had you know early career

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,320
researchers as well as established

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,960
leaderships in their discipline and our

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
second goal of this series was to create

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,040
connection and community. So we wanted

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,200
to create a place where people could

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
come together, learn from one another

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,799
and also build professional

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
relationships. Um so I just wanted to

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
share a quick story about how we have

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
created connection and community through

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,960
the series uh and how that reflects the

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,720
importance of creating these spaces. So

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
we had um an undergrad student who

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,200
attended one of our talks a few years

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,880
back and you know afterwards he reached

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
out to the speaker. he was very

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
interested in the work that she was

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,439
doing and those conversations eventually

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,799
led for uh him being hired into into her

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,439
lab. So that's just one example of how

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,280
this series can achieve community and

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,399
connection between everyone that is

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
joining here. So that's also um a call

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,439
for you guys that are joining to you

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,759
know take the opportunity to engage with

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,840
the community and hopefully explore new

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
opportunities. Um so thank you everyone

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,599
for joining us today. Now I'm going to

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,080
move on to introduce our speaker of

59
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,040
today. It's an honor for me to have here

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,640
today um Dr. Sylvia Restrepo. Um I

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,400
actually had the privilege of being her

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
student and I have always admired her

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
passion for science and her commitment

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,800
for student for her students and her

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,280
dedication to you know advance the

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,280
field. So Sylvia is a renown plant

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
pathologist and she's actually the first

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,920
female president of the Boyce Thompson

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,160
Institute. Um in her career she has had

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,319
several leadership leadership roles

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,519
which include being vice president of

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,120
research for universes in Colombia. She

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
also served as the dean of school of

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,400
science um in there and she also has

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
received numerous awards including

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,599
recognitions from the war academy of

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,959
science in 2009, the Louis Malise prize

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,920
in 2010, the national order of merit

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,159
from the French government in 2018 and

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,280
most recently the Jacob Ericson prize

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,599
from the Royal Swedish Academy in 2023.

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,400
So her research has focused on plant

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,640
pathogens and that impact food security

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
combining molecular biology, genomics

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,000
and the field study to understand these

86
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,840
organisms, evolve and adapt. Um so today

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,920
she will be sharing her journey studying

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,720
pamplatology. So please join me in

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,599
welcoming Sylvia to our series.

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,440
Thank you so much Anna Maria. It's a

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,840
really an honor for me that my former

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,720
students invite me to this seminar. So

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,080
that means that I left something in in

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,879
every each of of my students. But it's

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,879
is it's is really nice. Yes. So today

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,360
I'm going to talk about my research

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,720
about the plant pathology. I left the

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,959
the universes logo in here in this slide

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,120
because most of the of the work was done

100
00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:00,000
in universes. But let me take some time

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
to talk about the boy Thompson Institute

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
where I'm the the president right now.

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,720
So the Boy Thompson Institute is a

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,120
nonprofit organization

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,959
uh specializing in plant sciences. I'm

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
going to talk a little bit about that.

107
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
But we are in the Cornell University

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,359
campus. We are not Cornell. We are

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,120
affiliated to Cornell, but we are in the

110
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,440
middle of the campus. So if you come to

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
the campus, you cannot miss our building

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,919
that is totally in the middle of the

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,560
campus. So you cannot miss visiting us

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:34,320
and I I I hope you can visit us. Um

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,360
so a little bit some numbers we last

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,880
year we celebrated 100 years in in

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,919
operation. Uh we have 15 research labs.

118
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
Um we are close to 34 administrative

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,720
staff but combining with research

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,120
personnel we are 110 120 people in the

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
building from 40 different countries.

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
not at the same time but we have people

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,199
we have had people from from different

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,280
countries and we have six core

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,919
facilities and probably Anamaria can

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,919
recognize some of the crops I have in

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,160
this slide because we come from the same

128
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,720
country that is Colombia and we have

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,000
research not only in the usual crops

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,520
tomato potatoes etc but in some

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,680
neglected crops like ground um Cape

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,160
Gooseberry or golden berries coffee etc

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,120
uh I invite you to follow our uh

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
history. We had last year we made this

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,160
collection of the 10 decades of

136
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,360
research. I cannot go into to details

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,880
but I'll let you uh scan this QR where

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,840
you can find all the history. I'm only

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,560
going to highlight some moments in our

140
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,759
history. As I mentioned, we started 100

141
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,479
years ago actually in Yonkers, New York.

142
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,600
So we were founded by Colonel Boyce

143
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,240
Thompson. He was inspired by the he went

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,240
to Russia after the first world war and

145
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,680
he was impressed by the problem with

146
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,400
food security. So he started this uh

147
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,759
this institute to to work for for food

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,720
security. Um we in the in the 40s 50s we

149
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,280
were more focused on the environment

150
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,039
especially the effects of pollutants.

151
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,199
But then uh in the 70s BTI moved to ITA.

152
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,759
We included new lines of research like

153
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,680
plant pathology and then of course

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,280
chemical biology, genomics and

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,039
biioinformatics.

156
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Um as I mentioned we have 15 labs. These

157
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,960
are the the 15 labs. I cannot go into

158
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,039
detail but we work on on food security,

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,919
nutrition, resilience to different

160
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,720
stresses, productivity, health. We have

161
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,400
one lab working on human health and

162
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,960
biodiversity.

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,680
Um we are also committed with the

164
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,160
formation and of the new generation of

165
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,840
young scientists. So we have this

166
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:04,639
amazing uh reu program. Um it's the in

167
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,440
the summers where we receive close to 30

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
up to 40 students during the summer. not

169
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,880
only in BTI of course we don't have

170
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,479
enough space in BTI but we um we run the

171
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,400
program also with Cornell um and our

172
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,319
last pillar so we have this research

173
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
pillar this education pillar and the

174
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,120
third one is the translational program

175
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,960
we have our own uh incubation of

176
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,440
technologies here in the in the

177
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,080
institute so we call the translational

178
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,560
program but is a tech transfer office

179
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,360
plus all the industry relations and

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,360
collaborations so we have worked

181
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
For example, in in this technology, the

182
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,319
the hi-fi,

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,880
the hi-5 that is um um insect lines to

184
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,960
produce vaccines, but we also have work

185
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,800
on products like you can see here the

186
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,319
fitalics that is a component to uh

187
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,120
protect plants against diseases.

188
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,039
So, and we have these specialized

189
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,440
research services. We have a plant

190
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,479
growth facility, a phen phenotyping

191
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,000
facility, masspec, um transformation and

192
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,479
editing for plants, um the the

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,440
computational the biology computational

194
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,520
biology center and a cell imaging

195
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,400
center. So this this is the the lab the

196
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,199
the institute in a few slides and now

197
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,720
I'm going to jump to the research to

198
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,200
what my my passion is is in research as

199
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,440
Anna Maria told you and I'm going to

200
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,479
tell you two stories. I'm going to focus

201
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,360
on on a pathogen that I have worked for

202
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,200
most of my life is phytotera the genus

203
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,320
phytoera. I'm going to talk a little bit

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,480
of what is phytotera and how we discover

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,720
a new species of this pathogen in

206
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,080
Colombia but also I'm going to tell a

207
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,040
story about how to control the plant uh

208
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,839
this plant destroyer

209
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,720
um so phytoinestance

210
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:08,560
is um is a pathogen uh funguslike

211
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,800
actually was classified as a fungus a

212
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,920
long time ago but nowadays we know that

213
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,880
it's not a fungus is a proteise. So it's

214
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,880
in totally different location in in

215
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,600
taxonomy and it attacks a long um a

216
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,800
broad range of plants in the solenacious

217
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,880
family. So if you think solanatious is

218
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,320
potato tomatoes but we have in South

219
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,160
America a lot of different crops that we

220
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
from the solenacious crops that we don't

221
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,160
grow here in the state but I'm going to

222
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,519
talk a little bit about. So what are the

223
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,839
the this these organisms? So phytoera is

224
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,320
right here in the proise is in this

225
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,760
super group that is called the sar that

226
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,000
are the stropy alveolata and raria. You

227
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,519
probably know the alveolata because the

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,480
the causing agent of malaria is right

229
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,480
here and so phytoster is closely related

230
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,320
to this uh pathogen to plasmodium. And

231
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,800
in this uh we have uh so the phytoeras

232
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,360
in the phytoraa genus we have more than

233
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,720
100 species we are I think close to 150

234
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,120
in 10 clates but I'm going to focus only

235
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,519
in one of these clo cate that we call

236
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,519
the cate one and I'm going to tell the

237
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,800
story about uh this cate among them is

238
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:34,320
the famous phytoraa infestance it's

239
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,560
famous because it caused Um it it causes

240
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,920
this disease on potatoes and in due to

241
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,000
some political issues it caused uh the

242
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,720
famine because it destroyed all the

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,839
potatoes in Ireland in 1840s in the

244
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,600
1840s. So causing the death of more than

245
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,160
1 million people and and also 1 million

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,640
people also migrated to the United

247
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,120
States. So and to different countries

248
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,279
but mainly to the to the United States.

249
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,040
So it's famous because of that. It's

250
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:10,560
called the plant destroyer because it

251
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:14,399
can totally destroy um a crop in uh in

252
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,079
in few weeks. Okay. So I'm going to talk

253
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,320
about the phyto infestence and this can

254
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,279
sound very complicated but it's not. So

255
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,279
phyto infestence sensto in the USA and

256
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,839
sulatto in Colombia. What does that

257
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,200
mean? that it means that in in the

258
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,480
states in USA we only have one species

259
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,800
that does fit of phyto infestants but in

260
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,600
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru where we have

261
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,519
the center of diversity for the host of

262
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,600
the solenacious crops we have a lot of

263
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,399
species species of phtoa cohabiting in

264
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,200
uh the different host in our countries.

265
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,040
So um

266
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:01,040
no. Okay. So in the states I I work in

267
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,360
Cornell 25 years ago. I came back uh 25

268
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,279
years after. But 25 years ago we

269
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,120
conducted these simple experiments. We

270
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,959
only had one species. So we planted

271
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,600
tomatoes in the field. We made some

272
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:18,560
experiments. But when I went back to

273
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:22,079
Colombia in 2000, 2004, 2005, I um saw a

274
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,240
total different environment where you

275
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,880
have a potato field here and the potato

276
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,959
field starts to the right. But this is

277
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,839
the small garden from the grower. When

278
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,000
we went to this field, we saw that there

279
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,120
was a huge problem because in his

280
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,920
garden, the grower has some plants that

281
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,600
can be the reservoirs for the pathogen.

282
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,800
He has golden berries, uh, lulo, the

283
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,519
sanum ketoeni, he had peppers, he has

284
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,600
three tomatoes. So, it's a lot of plants

285
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,720
that can be the reservoirs for the

286
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,800
pathogen. So, no wonder why his potato

287
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,480
field was totally infected with the

288
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,600
pathogen. So when I I went to back to

289
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,720
Colombia, what I started to do is okay,

290
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,760
what is the real host range for this

291
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,680
pathogen. So we went out in the field in

292
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,839
several localities, several states of

293
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,480
the country and we collected a lot of

294
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,279
solenacious and we could describe these

295
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,560
solenacious species. So potato, yellow

296
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,279
potato, tomato, tomato, lulu and cape

297
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,959
gooseberry. But also we found the

298
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,839
pathogen in wild species like this one

299
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,639
solenum varum. So we described this the

300
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,360
the the phytotera phytora were thriving

301
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,959
in all these host everywhere in the

302
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,480
country and it's I guess the same in

303
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,720
Ecuador and and Peru. So a quick guide

304
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,440
to understand what I'm the the story I'm

305
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,240
going to tell you. Uh so I'm going to go

306
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,079
through this quick guide. So what we

307
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,279
call in phytoera we we the population of

308
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,600
phytoera are comprised of what we call

309
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,440
the clonal lineage.

310
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
A clonal lineage is all members

311
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,920
descending from a single individual. So

312
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,120
we call them US1 if they are the first

313
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,680
described in US or EC1 is the first

314
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,160
lineage described in Ecuador or co if

315
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,720
it's Colombia etc. So depending on the

316
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,079
country and the discovery we are going

317
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,360
to call them US1, US8, US12. Uh right

318
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,959
now we are up to US 25 here in the

319
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,720
states.

320
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:34,000
And a clonal lineage uh is defined by

321
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,480
the fingerprint that is with a marker

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,760
that the young people will not recognize

323
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,399
that is RFLP that we used back in the

324
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,360
past. But it's something like that. If

325
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,399
you see that in a gel, so each member of

326
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,440
a clonal lineage will have a set of of

327
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,760
bands in the gel that is unique to the

328
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,279
clonal lineage. So you see on top of the

329
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,800
gel the US1, US7, US8, they have each

330
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,680
one a pattern of bands in this gel. But

331
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,560
also clonal lineage is described not

332
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,079
only by the the the markers in the

333
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,079
genome, but also the mitochondrial type.

334
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:18,639
So it's also we amplify um a region of

335
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:21,360
the mitochondria and we um use uh

336
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,440
restriction enzymes to to to cut it and

337
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,079
depending also in the pattern we say

338
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,720
that it has the mitochondrial type 1 a 2

339
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,399
a 1 C you will see that is important in

340
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,800
my in my talk uh so this is like it

341
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,680
looks like when we do the amplification

342
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,760
and the restriction of a region of the

343
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,760
mitochonding

344
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,680
pattern we have 1 a 2 a etc. And finally

345
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,680
a clonal lineage is defined by the

346
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,160
mating type. So the three components

347
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,040
define a clonal lineage. So what is the

348
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,680
mating type? Mating type is because this

349
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,480
organism is eterotalic. It means that it

350
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,199
needs two different mycelia two

351
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,360
different vegetative states to be able

352
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,480
to cross and have sexual reproduction.

353
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,720
We call these two states or these two

354
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,120
mating types A1 and A2. So to determine

355
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,519
which mating type we have, what we do is

356
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,199
we take one reference. For example, we

357
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,560
know that US23 is mating type A1. So we

358
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,040
put a little bit of of the oh my seat

359
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,880
that we don't know US25. We didn't know

360
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,120
what it was. We put it to and so the two

361
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,440
strains cross in the middle of the petri

362
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,120
dish. We take a sample of that middle

363
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,000
and we see if they form the sexual spore

364
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,959
that is the O spore. If they form is

365
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,399
because A20 US 25 was A2. If doesn't is

366
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,759
because US25 is A1. So we define the

367
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:55,199
clonal lineages that way. So when I went

368
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,560
back to Colombia, I started to see what

369
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,040
we did first is determine the the host

370
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,560
range and then we characted to

371
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,760
characterize the population of the

372
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,319
pathogen. So we use what I mentioned the

373
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,400
RFP. So which clonal lineage do we have

374
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,640
in Colombia and we found that we have

375
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,959
the EC1. So is the Ecuador one. So

376
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,959
apparently we have the same clonal

377
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,000
lineage in Ecuador that is bordering

378
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,919
Colombia from the south to the north and

379
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,240
apparently it replaced the US1

380
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,200
population that was described in the 80s

381
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,360
and the '9s. So when I arrived to

382
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,559
Colombia the population was dominated by

383
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,240
this clonal lineage EC1. But I wanted to

384
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,320
study this population a little bit

385
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,799
further. So I used some markers that are

386
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,799
nuclear markers, mitochondrial markers

387
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,000
and some genes. This AVR3A gene is a

388
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,960
virulence gene and we found that the

389
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,480
population was not so diverse in terms

390
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,520
of the sequences of this gene. But we

391
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,400
saw this in the south of Colombia. We

392
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,200
saw this explosion of diversity in a

393
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,080
region that is bordering with Ecuador.

394
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,559
So I continue to do my studies but at

395
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,240
some moment I said wait

396
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,720
there is something happening in the

397
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,640
south of Colombia that is very strange.

398
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,320
Why do we have this explosion of

399
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,880
diversity only in that part of Colombia?

400
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,600
So we went back to the literature and we

401
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,559
found all of this. So we found that in

402
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,440
2000 a group in Ecuador published this

403
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,000
um paper saying that they found an

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,000
overpopul of phytoera similar to p

405
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,320
infestance attacking wild solenum

406
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,919
species in Ecuador. So attacking solenum

407
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,919
tetropetalum and solanum braolium. They

408
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,559
described that oh we have the mating

409
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,880
type A2 for the first time in Ecuador

410
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,679
and for the first time in the north part

411
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,640
of South America because all the strains

412
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,640
belong to A1 until that moment they

413
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,120
found we found a new mitochondrial

414
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,799
hloype 1C for the first time in

415
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,640
phytoraala history and these strains are

416
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,760
not pathogenic they don't attack

417
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,600
potatoes or tomatoes

418
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,640
so remember these are A2 1

419
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,720
So in four years later this group

420
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,559
published okay this um this A2 and A1

421
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,919
the ones that we have here that I

422
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:30,320
already mentioned A21C

423
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:34,880
um are well we we can describe them but

424
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,280
we found a new genotypes associated with

425
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,000
wild solenum species that they call the

426
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,880
anariconmum complex

427
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,160
that are A1 and 1 A in mitochondrial HLO

428
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,799
type. So this new population so a new

429
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:55,679
clonal lineage called EC2 that has A1 as

430
00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:01,200
a mating type and a mitochondrial hlo

431
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:05,520
type 1A. So now we have like two groups

432
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:08,240
of strains in attacking different host

433
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,520
and also nobody mentioned this one that

434
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:17,039
is important in our talk. a new lineage

435
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:19,039
EC3 that is also A1 1A but has a diff

436
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:23,760
different markers in the genome. So

437
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:26,880
that's why it is called EC3 and not EC2.

438
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,120
And then in 2004 so finally they said

439
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,919
okay we are going to group all these new

440
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,559
strains in a new name that is phytora

441
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,120
andina and they published and in

442
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,320
Colombia somebody published somebody

443
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,600
know sorry the group of um lucistella

444
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,400
meital published in 2008 this uh

445
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,039
interesting paper where they say these

446
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,480
strains when we do we use these

447
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,080
molecular markers AFL they group in two

448
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,720
different clusters.

449
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,039
one that is associated with tree tomato

450
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,679
and the other cluster that has these

451
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:07,679
strains that were isolated from potato.

452
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:12,320
And finally, what probably made me react

453
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,720
the most is this publication in in 2010

454
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
by my friend Ricardo Lea. But they

455
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,919
published that they have this new

456
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,159
species phtoandina a newly identified

457
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,960
pathogen of solenacious host in the

458
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,640
Indian region. And the weird thing from

459
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,840
this publication is that they put in the

460
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:36,640
same species different clonal lineage.

461
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:40,000
It's like you define a species with um

462
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,720
as a polygenetic entity that is totally

463
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,320
an oxymoron. So you cannot define a

464
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,159
species

465
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,960
from different genetic origins. So we

466
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,159
published this letter we wrote this

467
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,320
letter to the editor that we were not in

468
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,720
agreement with this publication from

469
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,280
Ricardo is it's important to say that

470
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,600
Ricardo and I are very good friends but

471
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,919
this is academic discussion that are

472
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,720
very important in science. So we

473
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,200
published this letter saying wait you

474
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,320
cannot say that this pandina that has

475
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,960
two clates two filogenetic clates in the

476
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,760
genome and in the mitochondria very

477
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,159
different 1 C and 1 A you cannot say

478
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,400
that these two entities are the same

479
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,960
species and even worse because in 2016

480
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,600
this group in Peru published wait it's

481
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,640
not only two or three it's more than

482
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,760
that we have another group of strains

483
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,400
associated ated with other crops that we

484
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,400
will call also phytotherandina. So now

485
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:49,280
we have three is is a paraphilletic

486
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:52,640
species defined. Um so we were not um we

487
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,840
were not okay with this. So

488
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,679
we question or our question was do we

489
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,919
have more than one species? Do the

490
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,320
isolates collected in three tomato

491
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,400
belong to a new species? So we also

492
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,880
published this paper saying wait in

493
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,000
plant pathology we really need to have a

494
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,400
framework to define a new species. How

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,640
can we accurately define new species in

496
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,720
plant pathogen microorganism? We cannot

497
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,080
only define a new pathogen because we

498
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,559
found it in a new species and what are

499
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,440
the main mechanism of speciation in

500
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,000
implant pathogens. We found that we have

501
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,520
all the mechanism of speciation. We

502
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,200
found some cases where we have

503
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,960
pre-mating um isolating mechanism is it

504
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,840
means that um that we have for example

505
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,919
the crosses fail to produce hybrids or

506
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,280
they cannot infect the same host. So

507
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,840
they can never be together in the same

508
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,039
uh environment or we have postmating

509
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,640
where the the hybrids are produced but

510
00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:00,400
they are not viable. um that is what we

511
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,039
call postigotic but the most common was

512
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,520
this one the premating where we have

513
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,480
different strains that will never meet

514
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,240
in nature because they have different

515
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,360
preferences of host preferences.

516
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,200
So our working hypothesis that we have

517
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,080
two different species pandina uh EC2 is

518
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,960
pandina but pandina e3 was a different

519
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,400
species that finally we demonstrated

520
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,640
that is p beta. So we went back to the

521
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,279
south of colombia and took a lot of

522
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,000
sample of these strains that were

523
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:40,159
attacking tree tomato and decimating the

524
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,200
trees in this region. And we took a lot

525
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:47,679
of lines of evidence to show that we in

526
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,840
reality had a a new species. This is

527
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,320
this is really interesting. We have the

528
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,039
three species here to the to the left.

529
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,919
So we have pandina p infestance and

530
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,640
pibeta say and we put them to grow in

531
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,279
different media in petrate dishes. But

532
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,080
look at the last two columns is PDA

533
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,919
potato and three tomato aar. Look at P

534
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,919
beta say it doesn't grow at all in

535
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,559
potato but it it loves the tree tomato

536
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,640
aar. In the contrary p infestance grows

537
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:21,679
very well in in potato but doesn't grow

538
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,640
so good in in the tree tomato. So we

539
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,880
started to see a preference for a

540
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,039
different host. So we run a phoggenetic

541
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,640
relationship or phoggenetic study with

542
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,799
more marus in the whole um in the whole

543
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,760
genome and we started to see that we

544
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,919
have in fact two different clates one

545
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,799
with pandina and the other one with p

546
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:50,240
beta what they call previously the the

547
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:52,640
EC3 and we did um with population study

548
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,559
where we saw that it was clearly that

549
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,360
the genetic backgrounds of the three

550
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,799
species pandina in in yellow, P

551
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,200
infestance in red and petate in in blue.

552
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,120
we they had different genetic

553
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,679
backgrounds and you can see in the in

554
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,480
the PCA and the DPC analysis that they

555
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,120
are really separated in the cluster and

556
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,240
look at this PCA where I'm I'm I'm

557
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,360
showing you here that the the what was

558
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,159
classified as the P&D3 in the previous

559
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,240
studies is clearly related to with these

560
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,039
strains we collected in the south of

561
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,120
Colombia from three tomato but we

562
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,559
conducted the two assays that I think

563
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,960
are the the um the the gold standard to

564
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,440
show that we have a different species.

565
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,360
The first one is we took the the strains

566
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,720
from the these three species and we

567
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,159
inoculated in all the different host. We

568
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,080
couldn't inoculate it in the wild

569
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,600
Solanum plants because we didn't have

570
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,480
them in in Colombia but the same that

571
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,080
they describe in Ecuador but we use tree

572
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,200
tomato tomato yellow potato and potato

573
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,080
and you can see that the pibet say only

574
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,880
infects uh tree tomato but it cannot

575
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,679
grow in the other host. So what we have

576
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,840
here is a strong ecological reproductive

577
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,720
isolation between p infestance and p

578
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,760
beta. We have never isolated the

579
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,360
infestant from tree tomato in the field

580
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,400
and we haven't be able to isolate

581
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,840
peta say from potato or tomato in the

582
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,559
field and what is the real the gold

583
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,360
standard in biology is to show that we

584
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,520
have this reproductive isolation. So we

585
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,559
attempted to do the crosses between the

586
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,120
three species and I'm only going to show

587
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,520
you the results of the crosses between P

588
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,480
infestance and P beta and what we show

589
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,520
is that the hybrids this is all sport

590
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,679
that is not viable. So the hybrids are

591
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,919
totally absent from the the the crosses.

592
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,640
So we have the reproductive isolation

593
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,440
showing that we have two different

594
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,399
species. So we published the the new

595
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,720
species with the idea and corroborating

596
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,720
that pandina is formed only on the uh

597
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:15,039
from uh strains of the EC2 clonal

598
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,679
lineage but P beta uh is comprises the

599
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,159
strains from the EC3. So we have a case

600
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,960
of ecological speciation. The three

601
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,120
species are reciprocally monopiltic and

602
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,559
the most probate scenario is speciation

603
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,960
with secondary contact. And then we

604
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,240
showed we we went to different three

605
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,559
tomato crops in the in the in the middle

606
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,640
or in the center of the of the country

607
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,679
and in the central part of the country.

608
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,840
And we showed that the peta say was also

609
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,080
present in in in this region not as

610
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,039
present in in the south. You can see in

611
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,600
Putoayo for example all the strains or

612
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,320
most of the the majority of strains are

613
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,520
peta say in the rest of the country we

614
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,600
have the two species uh cohabiting in

615
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,640
sympatric um presence um in the two

616
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,200
regions and we again corroborate that

617
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,039
these strains coming from three tomato

618
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,640
from the central part of the of the

619
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,600
country u belong to the peta

620
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,600
um species. You again see that they

621
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,640
separate very well the three clusters of

622
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,799
the three species pandina pepas and pin

623
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,360
infestance and something interesting

624
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,760
that I couldn't uh study more in

625
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,440
Colombia is these strains the the ones

626
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,960
that I'm showing here in the middle of

627
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,640
the PCA that were collected from tomato

628
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,000
and apparently they also are probably a

629
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,480
subspecies or a new species in phytora

630
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,279
so this host preference is really

631
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,440
driving the speciation of this pathogen

632
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,440
in our countries. And why is important

633
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,640
to define a good taxonomy because then

634
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,200
we realized in in some experiments that

635
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,159
I I will not show you today because of

636
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,760
time but we show that the P infestines

637
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:11,760
are very resistant to fungicides while

638
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,840
the P beta are not. So you can work with

639
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,000
these different fungicides to control

640
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,919
one disease or not the other. So it's

641
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,240
important the taxonomy for plant

642
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,120
pathologies is really important because

643
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,000
based on the on a very good taxonomy you

644
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,880
can uh design control strategies and

645
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,200
disease management and this is important

646
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,600
also because you can see a different

647
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,600
outcome of the disease. Here we

648
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,080
conducted more experiments to understand

649
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,679
the disease. So we use three tomato

650
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,000
leaves and we infected them with

651
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,559
phytotherabetas and pin infestant. And

652
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,440
you see again that phytoerabetas loves

653
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,159
the tree tomato. It goes right away

654
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,399
infecting it. The sporates where I have

655
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,720
these arrows here and you see the white

656
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,679
spotting is where the pathogen

657
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,880
sporulates. It is happy reproducing

658
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,640
while p infestance doesn't drive in in

659
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,840
this host um cause a disease that is

660
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,080
contained. This after the 120 hours

661
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,000
after the inoculation it stayed the

662
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,640
same. it didn't progress at all. And if

663
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,120
you see the the we follow the infection

664
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,960
with microscopy with light microscopy

665
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,000
and and um electronic electron

666
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,480
microscopy and you can see that phyto

667
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,840
infestence releases soul spores while

668
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,080
phytother beta state takes um it it time

669
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,399
to to to

670
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,720
germinate but finally germinates and

671
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,679
they produce this um at at 9 hours post

672
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,880
inoculation both of the pathogen try to

673
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,480
establish um communication with the host

674
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,960
to uh steal the nutrients with this

675
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,000
structure that are called hostoria where

676
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,039
the the oh my seed takes the nutrients

677
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,840
from the plant cells.

678
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,640
So we did also an experiment because our

679
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,399
hypothesis that is that some genes that

680
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,840
we call define the host of the plant

681
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,279
pathogens. So we did uh transcrytoics

682
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,320
experiments and we showed that the

683
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,159
pathogens in culture have a different

684
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,799
gene expressions that the pathogen

685
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,200
implanted. This is the the figure in the

686
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,840
in the left but in the right you can see

687
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,440
that the pathogen behaves as a

688
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,399
hemibotroof.

689
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,880
That means that in early time points of

690
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,559
the inoculation, it behaves in a way and

691
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,080
then when the plant tissue is is um

692
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,799
dying

693
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,760
the pathogen expresses order genes and

694
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,000
the transcriptto changes completely from

695
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,320
what we call the early stages to the

696
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,440
late stages to from biotrophy to

697
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,600
necotrophy and you can see that in I

698
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,320
don't expect you to to to see all the

699
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,399
the gene expression here but we have the

700
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,600
different time points after inoculation

701
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,760
in the x axis and you have all the genes

702
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,120
in the y- axis. What I want to highlight

703
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,440
is what we have four three different um

704
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,760
patterns of expression. We have the ones

705
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,840
that are in culture, the ones that are

706
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,799
during the biotrophy, the early time

707
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,120
points of the infection and the later

708
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,600
time points of the infection in the

709
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,799
necotrophy.

710
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,480
So we went and analyze the genome. what

711
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,399
is going on in this genome of

712
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,320
phytotherra beta say compared to the

713
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,000
phytother infest they have to have

714
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,519
something different because they cannot

715
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,880
infect the same host. So let's start to

716
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,919
look at the at the genome as a whole and

717
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,240
we were surprised first because we knew

718
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,039
that the genomes of pin infestance that

719
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,399
are the two ones to the right are full

720
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,960
of transposon and repetitive sequences

721
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,679
in the genome. But when we saw the

722
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,640
genome of P beta that actually was

723
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,640
bigger than the P infestance one, it was

724
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,960
not because of repetition. It was

725
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,480
because it has a whole genome

726
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,520
duplication.

727
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,159
So when you take some regions from the

728
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,679
phyto infest genome, you see them

729
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,079
duplicated in the genome of B beta. And

730
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,399
is very intriguing because it's the

731
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,599
first time we see this in the phyto

732
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,159
lineage. And I'm going to talk also

733
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,079
about the genes. So what are the host

734
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,000
range determinants? When a pathogen

735
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,879
attacks a plant, it will secrete a lot

736
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,159
of proteins, what we call the aectors.

737
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,159
So a pathogen like phyto secretes what

738
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,760
we call the cytoplasmaticus.

739
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,240
So I'm going to talk about the factors

740
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,879
that are secreted during the early

741
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,760
stages that we call biotrophy and

742
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,800
someectors that the pathogen secretes

743
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,960
when it goes to necroty. So I'm going to

744
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,280
talk about the RXLR and the

745
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,240
prinrossectors

746
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,040
and it also has a lot of apoplastictors

747
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,800
that target host enzymes and other

748
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,160
targets and it's interesting because

749
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,680
when you have this figure that is the

750
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,200
the and I I forgot to put the y- axis

751
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,520
but in in the x-axis we have the three

752
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,480
prime flanking intergenic region in the

753
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,680
y- axis the five prime. So in the lower

754
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,839
end of the figure to the to the left and

755
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,200
the bottom you will have these gene

756
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,200
dense uh repeat pull regions and in the

757
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,400
other corner you have the gene sparse

758
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,640
repeat rich regions and we say that the

759
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,720
phytoter species have these two two

760
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,680
speed genomes because they have these

761
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,839
gene dense repeat poor regions but you

762
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,240
have these gene sparse where you will

763
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,359
find all the aectors. Most of the

764
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,920
aectors are in these repetitive regions

765
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:59,119
that the pathogen uses as a reservoir

766
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:01,839
for new um variations and new um new

767
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,839
aectors to attack different pathogens.

768
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,480
So we focus on these um secreted

769
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,119
proteins. We found that PETA has a

770
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,359
higher number of secreted proteins. You

771
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,960
can see here that you have the secreted

772
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:19,680
proteins and and you have more in the in

773
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,320
the PET

774
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,720
and you have and it was interesting that

775
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,720
we have more RXLR. So these aectors that

776
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,480
are secreted in the biotrophic you can

777
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:37,280
see peta say at the last one with more

778
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:40,880
of these aerox xlr proteins but less of

779
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:44,000
the necotrophic crinkler ones

780
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,320
and then we compare which were where

781
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,599
were where which ones were unique to

782
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,079
beet to the different species and is

783
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,400
really interesting work that one of my

784
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,480
students did because we could find

785
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,119
comparing the genomes of all these

786
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,760
pathogens all these phytoeras that we

787
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,240
can find that peta say for example has

788
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,560
more unique of these rxlrs

789
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,160
that are I I'm not going to show you but

790
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,000
we also compare with the the

791
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,240
transcripttoies and are the ones that

792
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
are expressing plants so so the the the

793
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,839
the hypothesis I think it's it's right

794
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,320
that these unique help phtotherabetas to

795
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,160
attack these three tomatoes. What we

796
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,920
have to do of course is to silence these

797
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,800
aectors and to see if we have a

798
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,640
different disease outcome. But we have

799
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,440
as mentioned less crinkle uh aectors.

800
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:43,280
You can see PETA here uh the ones that

801
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,160
are secreted during the necroty.

802
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,320
And we compare the two. We again we see

803
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,359
that PE pa cell has less unique of these

804
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:57,200
necotrophic aectors but has more of

805
00:37:53,359 --> 00:38:02,320
these biotrophic aectors. And again

806
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:05,359
these um necotrophic and or these are um

807
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:11,359
in these gene sparse region that are the

808
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:14,240
ones in in green um the RXLRs. And we

809
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,920
confirmed that this biotrophy well

810
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,400
actually we didn't confirm that this

811
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,960
biotrophy are more expressed in the

812
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,960
early time points because we saw a very

813
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,480
diverse pattern of expression. What you

814
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,960
are seeing here is the pattern of

815
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,440
expression during the time points after

816
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,119
inoculation but we confirm that the

817
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,280
necrophy are indeed express in the

818
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,359
necrophy part of the ex of the

819
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,480
inoculation that are the later time

820
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,720
points. Okay, I'm going to jump very

821
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,480
quickly to end up my presentation to

822
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,599
talk about what we also uh try to do to

823
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,000
control this pathogen and is a very nice

824
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,599
study conducted by some of my students

825
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,720
back in Colombia where we targeted this

826
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,240
denovo pyramidine biosynthesis um

827
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,920
pathway

828
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,119
and we described all the the synthesis

829
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,280
of pyramidine and we found that some of

830
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,640
these enzymes enmes have been attractive

831
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,720
attractive for drug development. Um

832
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,520
actually the one of these enzymes the

833
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,920
human enzyme the fourth enzyme that I'm

834
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,320
showing in here has been attractive for

835
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,359
drug development and is the target of

836
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,880
one compound but also in plasmodium

837
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,160
fiparum

838
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,560
uh they have uh as said and they are

839
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,119
undergoing phase two of clinical trials

840
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,040
of another compound that is targeted

841
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,839
against this enzyme and remember that

842
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,720
plasmodium is very closely related

843
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:50,560
with our phytoter. So we started to see

844
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,720
when when during the infection these

845
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,599
enzymes are expressed and it was

846
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,079
interesting that all the the enzymes

847
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,240
that are in the novo pathway the ones

848
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,000
that produce the pyramidine are

849
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,079
overexpressed induced in the biotrophic

850
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,320
moment of the expression. is really

851
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:14,000
clear in the f in panel A and panel C.

852
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,320
While in the salvage um the the the

853
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,480
enzymes that are in the salvage that is

854
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,839
the ones that take the pyramidines from

855
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,680
the host are repressed in the early time

856
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,560
points but are induced when the plant is

857
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:33,040
dying and the pathogen is stealing the

858
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,599
the the nutrients from a death plant. So

859
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,320
what we did with another student is to

860
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,359
take one of these compounds that is

861
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,720
already registered that is know we know

862
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,839
that is safe in humans and see if we can

863
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,000
control the enzyme. So what we did first

864
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,960
is to confirm the mitochondrial

865
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,839
localization of the enzyme. So we show

866
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,680
that is located in the same in in the

867
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,359
same places where we have the

868
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,359
mitochondrial marker or reporter. We

869
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:07,680
then uh did some assays of this compound

870
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,480
to see if inhibits the grow of the

871
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,040
pathogen and indeed if we increase the

872
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,119
dose we have less grow of the pathogen

873
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,240
and we compare that with corset that is

874
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,960
a fungicide and finally something that

875
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,079
is important is like we show that this

876
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,359
compound doesn't affect the host the

877
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,440
solenum the potato enzyme as well as the

878
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,200
phytoera because if we want to use that

879
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,880
compound we cannot

880
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,680
inhibit the enzyme from the potato. So

881
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,760
what are the new avenues of my research

882
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,319
here in Ithaca? Uh so I'll still focus

883
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,400
so I arrived here two years ago. I only

884
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,040
started my lab one year ago but I'm

885
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,920
going to focus in phyto infestence

886
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,920
working in the population dynamics. We

887
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,319
still studying the population genetics

888
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,800
of the pathogen here in the states

889
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,000
monitoring the population. We are going

890
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,160
to show uh to assay new compounds that

891
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,240
are already registered to see if we can

892
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,680
control phytoera with new modes of

893
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,280
actions, new molecules. But I'm starting

894
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,800
a new pathway in in this research that

895
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,440
is the study of the microbiome because

896
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,000
the microbiome is the first line of

897
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,160
defense that a plant has. When the

898
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,319
pathogen lands on a on a leaf, it has to

899
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,880
defend against all the microorganisms

900
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,680
that are on that leaf. So we want to

901
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,359
understand how the microbiome interacts

902
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,599
with the pathogen. Why some some plants

903
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,400
like golden berry are totally resistant

904
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,880
to the pathogen while we have others is

905
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,280
besides the genetic makeup of the plant.

906
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,119
I was telling you that I'm continue to

907
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,280
monitor the populations of the pathogen

908
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,599
here in the states. we are going to

909
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,960
assay all the registered compounds we

910
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,560
have for um this pathogen or another or

911
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,640
other pathogen that are closely related

912
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,400
to phytora but I'm going to start

913
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,160
working also on the microbiome because

914
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,079
the microbiome is the first line of

915
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,440
defense that the plant has when a

916
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,520
pathogen lands on on it on the leaves or

917
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,800
on the stem etc. So we want to

918
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,680
understand what is the role of

919
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,440
microbiome in the disease outcome and we

920
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,440
cannot forget that I come from the

921
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,079
second most biodiverse country in the

922
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,240
world. I have described a lot of its

923
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,920
biod diversity especially in fungal

924
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,319
species. We have described a lot of

925
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:35,200
fungal new fungal species and um from

926
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:38,160
macro or micro fungi. So I will love to

927
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,800
continue exploring this diversity in a

928
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,880
very sustainable way because I think it

929
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,440
has the answers for a lot of problems we

930
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,359
are facing now. And finally I would like

931
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,599
to thank my my lab at BTI. This picture

932
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,839
was taken from the last field season

933
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,240
during the summer my collaborators

934
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,640
around the world and my group in

935
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,720
Colombia the funding sources for this

936
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,400
work I presented today. and I will be

937
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,760
very happy to answer any questions you

938
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,680
may have.

939
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,800
>> Yeah. So, thank you very much Dr. Rest

940
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,560
triple. Um, what we would like to do now

941
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,079
is open the floor for questions. We also

942
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,520
have a brief survey that we will send

943
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,160
through email and possibly through the

944
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,680
chat. Um, so if anyone has questions,

945
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,200
please feel free to ask. Now the well,

946
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,839
one of the first questions I have is are

947
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,160
you seeing um differences in the

948
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,079
pathogens as climate change has occurred

949
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,680
over time? Like are you seeing them

950
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,440
moving into different areas? Are they

951
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,839
moving up more north now?

952
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,160
>> Yeah, in Colombia we saw that, Ricardo.

953
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,000
We saw that every time we go to the

954
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,640
field, the breeders are putting the

955
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,960
potatoes up in the mountains uh to

956
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,319
escape from the pathogen that we see

957
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:52,000
more oper and and surviving freezing

958
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,880
temperatures. So um and so they go up

959
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,119
and up. So because they also come from

960
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,960
the from other crops. So yes, in

961
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,760
Colombia we saw that. I haven't seen

962
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,520
this in the states because I'm I haven't

963
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,680
studied so long this population here,

964
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,040
but I'm sure we will see some changes

965
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,440
especially the survival of the spores uh

966
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,760
in heat and temperatures.

967
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,480
>> Yep. Yeah, it's an interesting question

968
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,720
uh agriculturally because you know the

969
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,760
potato famine in Ireland caused a huge

970
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,440
economic disruption and potentially you

971
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,000
know if it gets into a monoculture

972
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,520
potato crop like the US or or you know

973
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,839
somewhere in North America it could also

974
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,960
be very disruptive. Do the diverse

975
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:35,280
proteins in P betasai have more

976
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,680
specified functions to better infect

977
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,440
tree tomato cells specifically and

978
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,599
contribute to its high affinity for tree

979
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,720
tomatoes versus other members of the

980
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,720
Solanosa family?

981
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:53,040
>> Yeah. Well, this is a very good question

982
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:56,480
and um well until now it doesn't appear

983
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,800
to to have so many different um

984
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,440
different functions. Apparently they

985
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,839
belong to the same families we have seen

986
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,839
in other intestines but um we have new

987
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,079
targets. So probably these new targets

988
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,760
are the one that confer the the ability

989
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,960
to infect a new uh beta say. So we are

990
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,000
seeing new targets in in enzymes of the

991
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,640
host but we cannot say if it's exactly

992
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,160
those new targets that are making the

993
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,720
difference or the combination of

994
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,319
different aectors. That's why we want to

995
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,640
now start um silencing the different

996
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,960
aectors to see if we have a different

997
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,920
outcome in PE beta in in the solenoium

998
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,599
sorry

999
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,079
>> what contributes to the geographical

1000
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,560
changes in lineage distribution is it

1001
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:49,079
vectors agricultural practices import of

1002
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,079
contaminated seeds/imp imports

1003
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,319
>> uh my good friend Julian thank you for

1004
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,079
the question so yes well actually

1005
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,760
everything contributes. Um well, for

1006
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,240
example, in Colombia and Ecuador that we

1007
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,160
have the same lineages because we have

1008
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:09,119
this like porous borders that everything

1009
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,400
goes and come through our borders in in

1010
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,720
South America. But um we see that we

1011
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,440
have different um lineages in different

1012
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,520
countries is um Julian I think is

1013
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,079
because we have different host for

1014
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,319
example when I didn't show that but when

1015
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,319
we saw the difference of lineages from

1016
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,680
Colombia and Venezuela we saw that we

1017
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,079
have different lineages in the two

1018
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,400
countries is because you we use totally

1019
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,960
different potatoes. When I went to

1020
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,040
Venezuela they use cultivars that we

1021
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,480
don't know in Colombia. So the pathogen

1022
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,520
gets adapted to those um to these

1023
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,040
different varieties of potato.

1024
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,560
So I was wondering like do you also see

1025
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,400
like these pathogens do you also see

1026
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,200
horizontal gene transfer where they pick

1027
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,720
up um like um features from other types

1028
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,680
of pathogens and and make them like a uh

1029
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,839
they evade some like host immune system

1030
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,160
traits just make them a better pathogen

1031
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,520
overall

1032
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,440
to make them more difficult to deal

1033
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,760
with.

1034
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,599
>> Sorry Ricardo, can you repeat? Oh, I was

1035
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,760
asking um if you see um indications on

1036
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,280
these pathogens for for like gene

1037
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,760
transfers between pathogens.

1038
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,400
>> Okay.

1039
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,000
>> Yeah.

1040
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,680
>> Uh yes and actually not only from

1041
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,760
pathogen to pathogen but also from

1042
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,040
bacteria to these pathogens, fungi to

1043
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,839
these pathogens we see and we have also

1044
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,760
described some viruses that live within

1045
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:41,119
the iy of the of the pathogen. So it's a

1046
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:43,920
yeah it's a jungle out there. Yeah.

1047
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,680
>> Is P betaai easy to manipulate with

1048
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,960
tools such as crisper? Could that be

1049
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,400
used to study gene function?

1050
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,880
>> Thank you Dylan for the question.

1051
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,760
Actually we haven't tried in beta say we

1052
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,760
have tried in pinfestance and we have

1053
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,960
transformed pin infestant in your

1054
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,160
crisper. uh is not something that is

1055
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,440
very reproducible right now and we are

1056
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,160
going to collaborate with a group in

1057
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,599
Denmark that apparently do that better

1058
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,280
than us more reproducible but I guess

1059
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:18,400
once you can do it in infest and I don't

1060
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:23,040
see why we can do it in um in peta say

1061
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:27,359
because the the cell wall is the same um

1062
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,440
I think it's um the the

1063
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,319
actually it can be simpler because P

1064
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,640
beta say is deployed while P infestance

1065
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,960
sometimes is triploed or have three

1066
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,720
zombies so it's more complicated to do

1067
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,200
and that's why it's so less reproducible

1068
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:47,119
but yeah we haven't tried but I guess it

1069
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,520
will be easier than in P infestence

1070
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,599
>> would you expect in the US population a

1071
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,520
diversity driven

1072
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,440
more by cultural practices instead of

1073
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,920
host diversity

1074
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,760
>> okay thank you Nadia it's so nice to see

1075
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,599
all my students asking me questions um

1076
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,680
and from Canada in different parts of

1077
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,599
the world. Well, Julian is close to you

1078
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,920
but but Nadia is in Canada. So yes, I

1079
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,400
would say yes Nadia because we don't

1080
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,440
have that explosion of diversity but we

1081
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,160
are seeing more Cape Gooseberry growing

1082
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,720
in the states. You can actually you see

1083
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,720
to the grocery stores and you see these

1084
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,599
ubas in different markets, but we put

1085
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,319
those in the field this last summer and

1086
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,640
they were so nice. Nobody attacked them.

1087
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,599
They are like the captain Americas of

1088
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,000
the they have the shield and no pathogen

1089
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,160
at all in the cape gooseberries we put

1090
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,040
in the field. So I would say that

1091
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,880
diversity is going to d is going to be

1092
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,200
um more

1093
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,960
caused by practical cultural practices

1094
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:56,960
than host diversity. Yes, that's a very

1095
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:59,119
good question and and and if I can say

1096
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,880
more about that question is what we see

1097
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,800
in the states because in the states we

1098
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,880
see preference very strong host

1099
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,480
preference between the potato strains

1100
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,359
and the tomato strains. So it's only

1101
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,040
that but within the potato strains you

1102
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,200
see difference because of cultural

1103
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,160
practices that you can see different

1104
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,160
kind of population in in North Carolina

1105
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,359
to the ones in New York to the ones in

1106
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,680
Idaho. Yeah.

1107
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,800
>> Interesting. What uh what direction do

1108
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,040
you want to take for the host

1109
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,319
microbiome? Because I'm here at the

1110
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,839
Broad which is known for the Stanley

1111
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,599
Center and there's been links with kind

1112
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,359
of like autism and microbiome and some

1113
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,040
of these psychiatric disorders. So

1114
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:41,359
there's a host of health issues that you

1115
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:44,720
can look at the microbiome through.

1116
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:47,119
>> Yeah, I think that we can take a lot of

1117
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,440
examples for the human microbiome.

1118
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,440
Ricardo, actually it's been very

1119
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,559
inspiring to read all these papers about

1120
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,160
the the the cases in humans to to

1121
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,400
understand what we should do in in the

1122
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,400
plant and in the plant. I have studied

1123
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,800
the endopites is these organisms that

1124
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,599
live inside of the plant without co

1125
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:13,599
causing symptoms or apparent damage and

1126
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:17,599
there is a lot of different um organism

1127
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:20,400
manipulating the host immunity. So I

1128
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,400
want to understand what is going on if

1129
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,319
on top of this microorganism we put a a

1130
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,880
pathogen and then we change the

1131
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,800
microbiome and we can see if there is a

1132
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,200
difference disease outcome like in

1133
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,920
humans if we change the microbiome can

1134
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,280
we control diseases can we do something

1135
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,760
and I'm sure we can we can find

1136
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,559
something interesting to control the

1137
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,319
disease. Yep.

1138
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,839
>> Right. Well, thank you very much again

1139
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,839
for your presentation. It was very

1140
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,720
interesting. Um, we have two more

1141
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:54,160
minutes. If we get any more

1142
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,880
questions, we can answer them, but I

1143
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,280
think we will end at the top of the

1144
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,119
hour. So, if you have any questions for

1145
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,160
us, please feel free to ask. We're super

1146
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,720
interested in in this type of work. Um,

1147
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,319
I used to work I started my PhD well, I

1148
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,599
started my research career in a plant

1149
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:13,280
biology lab, actually. Um, and you know

1150
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,559
>> what happened, Ricardo? What happened?

1151
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,599
>> I I I ended up having

1152
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,599
>> What did you do?

1153
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,119
>> I ended up doing psychiatric genetics

1154
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,680
and looking for genes for autism and

1155
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,160
stuff. But

1156
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,160
>> okay, you can come back anytime.

1157
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,160
>> Anytime.

1158
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,119
>> Yeah, it was it was really nice to to be

1159
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,040
here and to to have this opportunity.

1160
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,359
Thank you again, Anamaria, for the

1161
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,160
invitation and you all, Ricardo. And

1162

awesome.

1163
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,920
>> Thank you again, everyone. Thank you,

this is what we wanted out of the

1167
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,720
speaker series. So this is a great way

1168
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:53,359
to end Hispanic Heritage Month with with

1169
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,680
this kind of of of work. So uh we hope

1170
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,920
to see everyone in our next next series

1171
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,920
