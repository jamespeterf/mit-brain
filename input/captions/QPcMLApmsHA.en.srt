Hello and welcome to Today I Learned: 
Climate from the Massachusetts Institute  

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,000
of Technology. I'm Laur Hesse Fisher. 
If you're like many of our listeners,  

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you might be wondering: okay, so the CO2 from 
burning fossil fuels is warming the planet,  

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,520
right? So why haven't we just gotten rid 
of all of these fossil fuels already? Well,  

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,040
we live in a world that's currently dependent 
on fossil fuels, yet a lot of that dependence is  

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,040
invisible to us. So we collaborated with TABLE, 
an international coalition of universities that  

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,960
helps the public understand our food system. Their 
recent podcast miniseries is called Fuel to Fork,  

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,600
and it explores all the many ways that 
fossil fuels are involved in putting food  

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,280
on our plates. And today we are going to get a 
glimpse into the hard work that is happening to  

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,160
eliminate pollution from the food system, and 
in doing so explore the very real ways that  

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,600
our food now depends on fossil fuels. Even to 
produce the simplest thing, like a tortilla

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:16,360
chip. I love tortilla chips. In fact I had some 
on the weekend and they were very tasty. That's  

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,560
Jennifer Clapp. I'm a professor and Canada 
Research Chair in global food security and  

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,760
sustainability at the University of Waterloo 
in Canada. I'm also a member of IPES-Food,  

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,240
which is the international panel of experts on 
sustainable food systems. She's here to help  

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,080
us follow the journey of a tortilla chip from farm 
to grocery store, taking note of all the ways that  

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,800
fossil fuels are used along the way. So let's get 
started. Well tortilla chips, have relatively few  

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,160
ingredients. They're made of corn, or in the rest 
of the world it's called maize. Here in the US we  

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:02:00,600
have over 90 million acres of corn fields. If that 
were a state, it would be the fifth largest, just  

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,280
barely behind Montana. And if you took a drive 
through this great state of corn, the first thing  

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,440
you might notice above the vast waving expanses 
of green are the machines that tend the corn from  

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,440
planting to harvest. Farm machinery typically 
runs on diesel fuel. And that's the machinery  

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,480
used to plow the fields, drill the seeds, spread 
the fertilizer, spread the pesticides, spread the  

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,240
herbicides. Also for harvesting crops big machines 
are used, you know, combine harvesters and other  

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,120
kinds of machines that thresh the grain. It's 
probably no surprise that these great machines  

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:46,240
require fuel to run. But what about the quieter 
parts of a corn farm, like the barns? Corn has a  

27
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,080
lot of moisture in it. It's a heavy crop, and 
to store it properly it needs to be dried. And  

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:00,480
farmers typically use giant fans in a barn to dry 
out the corn, and typically heat those barns with  

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,960
propane fuel. The two things that we've mentioned 
so far, the farming machinery and drying the crop,  

30
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,880
make up about half of the fossil energy use on 
a typical corn farm. There's one last big chunk  

31
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,240
of emissions that we're going to come back to a 
little bit later in this episode. For now though,  

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,520
we're packing up our corn for sale. Commodities 
like corn do travel around a fair bit. If it's  

33
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:34,160
trucked it's typically using diesel fuel, and 
also if it's shipped it's definitely using oil.  

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,920
Those fossil fuels get our dried corn to a 
factory where it will be turned into masa,  

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:48,360
the delicious dough that makes a tortilla. 
And what it involves is soaking and simmering,  

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,520
like cooking, these dried kernels of corn for up 
to 12 hours. That process is called wet milling.  

37
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,480
For our tortilla chips, this is almost the end of 
the line. The masa from the wet mill is ready to  

38
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,920
be shaped and baked and fried. Other corn products 
will keep passing through more screens and  

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,200
grinders and dryers and fermenters on their way 
to becoming things like cornstarch and corn syrup,  

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,760
and even the ethanol that we add to gasoline. 
There isn't good recent data on this, but back  

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,200
in 2001 the US Energy Information Administration 
did a study of corn wet mills and found that they  

42
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:37,000
used 15% of all of the energy in, not just corn, 
but the entire US food industry. So that gives you  

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,960
a sense of just how energy consumptive it is. When 
you hear about ultra processed foods, this is what  

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,840
it means. The ingredients go through a whole bunch 
of machines to break them down to their proteins  

45
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,360
and fibers and oils and such. It tends to use 
a lot of fossil fuels, and be less healthy for  

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,040
us too. With our tortilla chips the last machine 
would be the fryer that makes them nice and crispy  

47
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,480
and snackable. But there's one more step 
before they're shipped to the grocery store,  

48
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,560
and that's packaging. In my local community I 
can buy corn chips that come in a paper bag,  

49
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,520
which really makes me happy. But most corn chips 
that you're going to find in a grocery store shelf  

50
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:26,840
are packaged in plastic. And that plastic is made 
of—do you know? It's oil! Yeah, our food system  

51
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,680
doesn't rely on fossil fuels just for energy. Tons 
of stuff, packaging, farm equipment, is also made  

52
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,200
of fossil fuels. You might have seen large sheets 
of plastic covering farm fields that sort of keep  

53
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,640
in moisture and keep temperatures warm in the 
soil, or covering a greenhouse. Herbicides,  

54
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,440
pesticides: they're all fossil fuel sort of 
oil based chemicals. So when we think about  

55
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,920
fossil fuels on the farm, they're just, they're 
everywhere. Remember earlier when we found that  

56
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,800
the farming and drying machinery added up to about 
half of a farm's fossil energy use? Well, most of  

57
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,080
the remaining half comes from just one of those 
fossil fuel-based chemicals alone. The fertilizer  

58
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,800
use is probably the biggest use of fossil energy 
when we're talking about growing corn. For as long  

59
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,240
as there's been farming, people have been adding 
fertilizers like manure and wood ash to soil to  

60
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,480
revitalize it. These products really started 
to be used much more frequently after around  

61
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:42,440
the 1840s, when scientific developments led to an 
understanding about the importance of nitrogen,  

62
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,200
phosphorus and potassium as key nutrients that 
plants need for better plant growth. Phosphorus  

63
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:57,360
and potash are actually today typically mined 
from the earth and processed to make fertilizers.  

64
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,760
But the third nutrient, nitrogen, is trickier. 
There's no nitrogen rock that we can mine. On the  

65
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,160
other hand, there is one very abundant source 
of nitrogen very close to hand. It's in the  

66
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:19,520
air that we're breathing. Earth's atmosphere is 
almost 80% nitrogen gas. And scientists knew that  

67
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,920
nitrogen was in the air. They just didn't know 
how to capture it and make it into a physical,  

68
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,280
usable form that could be applied to soil. And 
then, in the early 1900s, two German chemists,  

69
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,840
Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, figured it 
out. If you react nitrogen with hydrogen,  

70
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:46,040
they mix to make NH3, also known as ammonia. 
And this became the main ingredient for modern  

71
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:53,480
fertilizers. The catch is that the hydrogen comes 
from yet another fossil fuel: natural gas. So the  

72
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:00,240
Haber-Bosch process really changed everything, 
because people didn't have to worry about where  

73
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,760
the nitrogen was going to come from to fertilize 
crops. And the use of synthetic nitrogen increased  

74
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,000
massively. And what that's meant is that more 
crops can be grown, more land around the world  

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,560
can be cultivated for agriculture, because the 
nutrients can be continually replenished. And on  

76
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,280
that land humans are supplying a regular stream of 
nitrogen, provided mostly by natural gas. Where,  

77
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,480
unfortunately, it continues to impact the 
climate in yet another way. There's been a  

78
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,160
tendency to over-apply fertilizer, just kind of 
like an insurance policy that farmers want to be  

79
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,680
sure that they're putting enough on the field to 
ensure plant growth. But not all nitrogen that's  

80
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,080
put down in the field is taken up by the plant. 
And then soil microbes eat up the nitrogen, and it  

81
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,120
converts it into a gas called nitrous oxide, which 
is more damaging than carbon dioxide when we're  

82
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,440
talking about climate change. And corn uses a lot 
of fertilizer, so it has a lot of nitrous oxide

83
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:16,160
emissions. Fertilizer is by far the biggest 
way that humans create nitrous oxide,  

84
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:24,280
this highly climate-warming gas. If you add both 
the manufacturing process and the nitrous oxide,  

85
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,840
fertilizer has the same impact on the climate as 
a major country. In fact, it contributes as much  

86
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,440
to climate change each year as Japan does, which 
is the world's seventh largest climate polluter,  

87
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,840
So all in all the fertilizer industry is pretty 
significant. Okay, so what do we do about all  

88
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:51,960
this? You might ask, is it even possible to have 
our tortilla chips without the climate pollution?  

89
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,280
Can I imagine a fossil fuel free bag of corn 
chips? I think in this current world that we  

90
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:06,000
live in that's hard to imagine, given all of the 
places in the whole production process that have  

91
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,320
relied on and continue to rely on fossil energy. 
Let's take farming machinery for a moment. You  

92
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,680
might say, well, couldn't we just run these 
machines on electricity, like switching a gas  

93
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,240
powered car for an electric car? And yeah, we 
probably could. But it's not straightforward,  

94
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,920
because a tractor has to have a lot of horsepower, 
especially for plowing, especially for these  

95
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,440
sort of harvesting and threshing activities. That 
means that an electric tractor would need to hold  

96
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:43,400
a lot of energy in its battery. For the heaviest 
equipment, like combine harvesters, the industry  

97
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,040
is still waiting on more powerful motors and 
batteries to hit the market, and to be affordable.  

98
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,920
But don't throw up your hands. There is a lot we 
can do right now. Like in the drying barns, which  

99
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,360
can be heated electrically, and the wet mills that 
can switch to clean power sources. Or what about  

100
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,480
the problem of over-applying nitrogen? That's 
no good for anybody who cares about our climate,  

101
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,600
but it's also especially bad for the people who 
are buying all of this fertilizer that just ends  

102
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:19,560
up being wasted. Because it's a big cost for 
farmers. And the big companies are all investing  

103
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:27,840
in digital technology that can analyze the type 
of soil and its fertility, and then provide advice  

104
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,720
to farmers that you should only put this much 
fertilizer in this part of your field, maybe you  

105
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,600
want to use a little bit more in that part of 
your field. There are also these things called  

106
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,160
slow-release fertilizers, which are coated in a 
slow-dissolving plastic so that all the nitrogen  

107
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,440
doesn't get dumped on the field at once. Or, 
could we produce the nitrogen that our corn needs  

108
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,400
without using natural gas? There are emerging 
processes that use clean electricity instead,  

109
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,880
or even engineered microbes in the soil. All of 
these ideas are being actively pursued right now,  

110
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,520
and also studied to see what kinds of unintended 
effects might arise if we start doing things like  

111
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,720
treating our soils with plastics, or using a lot 
of energy for AI-powered digital farming tools. So  

112
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,880
in this episode, we wanted to highlight the often 
hidden fossil fuel use in our food system. But  

113
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,680
we also wanted to highlight the often invisible 
solutions that are happening. Because as more and  

114
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,840
more of get activated and equipped to tackle this 
issue, researchers, innovators, investors, and  

115
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:43,280
folks working across the food system get creative, 
and solutions like these become possible. So it's  

116
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,400
a big ask to say, okay, throw that model out the 
window and start scratch with something else. But  

117
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,600
there are models of other things that can work, 
such as agroecology, which is using nature's own  

118
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,160
processes to provide the fertilization of of soils 
by growing different crops next to each other.  

119
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,800
It's a big change. And so it's not going to happen 
overnight. But I I always think about the fact  

120
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,320
that the way that we ended up with the agriculture 
we have today took about 200 years. Farmers did  

121
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,760
adopt synthetic fertilizers. They did adopt 
hybrid seeds. You know, all of the aspects that  

122
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,680
we think of as conventional farming today were 
at one point new technologies. So we shouldn't  

123
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,120
think necessarily that farmers are going to be 
resistant to change. But that change has to be  

124
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,920
tangible for them in terms of the benefits, and 
it has to be easy, and it has to be affordable.  

125
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,560
And that's harder than just saying, keep the 
fossil fuels in the ground. But in the end,  

126
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,520
this hard, steady work is what it's going to 
take to have a clean economy that offers us a  

127
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:59,040
good living and the things that we need. And even 
the things that we like, like a bag of chips.

128
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,960
That is our show. But if you're interested 
in learning more about fossil fuels in the  

129
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,920
food system, I invite you to check out the
