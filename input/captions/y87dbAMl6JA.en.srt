1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
So, I'm Tom Lowry, CEO here at Satellite

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,279
Bio. Uh, we're founded out of the

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,440
laboratory of Singita Bacha at MIT and

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,519
I'll share with you briefly how we're

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,280
developing off-the-shelf cell therapies

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,799
that boost liver function and protect

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,600
the brain of patients in their time of

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,439
need. So, severe liver disease, whether

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,119
it's genetic disease or metabolic

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,480
diseases, alcohol use disorder,

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,039
infections, all affect the primary cell

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,720
in the liver called the hpatocy. cause

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
it to go from a healthy state shown here

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
in purple to an unhealthy state shown

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,600
here in yellow. And that leads to a

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,680
buildup of toxins in the blood. The the

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
most uh typical toxin that builds up is

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
ammonia. And uh the unfortunate thing

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
that occurs for folks that are suffering

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,160
from insufficient liver function or

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
hpatic insufficiency is that the the

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
toxins build up and they affect the

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
brain. In fact, people that have uh

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,280
severe liver disease can have

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,360
manifestations of it that look like

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,960
dementia uh where their brain function

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,120
has been compromised due to the blood

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,039
toxins that haven't been processed by

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
their liver. Patients that suffer from

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,559
cerosis uh over a third of them will

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
develop a phenomenon called

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,280
hpaticanphylopathy.

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,680
And once you have this

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,600
hpaticanphylopathy, you have a 50%

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,880
one-year mortality rate. And the only

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,400
cure today is transplant. Our therapies

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,560
deliver a therapeutically active

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
hpatocy, therapeutically active liver

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,479
cell to patients that need a boost in

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
their liver function without requiring

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,560
the need for a transplant. Uh we can

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,960
infuse the cells directly in the liver.

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,119
That's SB 101 on the on the left hand

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,280
side where the cells engraft and then

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,360
support and boost liver function. Or we

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,360
can infuse what we call a tissue seed.

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,520
100 micron diameter heteroscellular

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,600
aggregate that allows us to create

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,439
satellite liver tissue in an organ

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
outside of the liver because the livers

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
are serotic and won't accept a cell

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
infusion. One of the key breakthroughs

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,640
at satellite is that we have a

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
sustainable and scalable cell source for

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
decades. People have been trying to get

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,680
to apatocite either from IPS-C's or

57
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,439
other cell sources to be able to provide

58
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,680
a boost in liver function to these types

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,439
of patients. We actually source cataric

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
cells but then we expand them in the lab

61
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,600
using the regenerative cues that

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,920
hpatocytes are responsive to. We can

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,920
maintain adult and and mature function.

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
The other innovation is that we can

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,319
stabilize that hpatocy and get it to

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
engraft outside of the liver. That's one

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,160
of the key innovations because

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,400
apatocytes obviously they're they're um

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,959
have been evolved to develop and grow in

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
a liver but with this tissue seed uh

71
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,720
that we can actually get the cells to

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,000
engraft outside the liver and provide a

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
boost in liver function to these

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
patients that are serotic and have very

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,239
scarred and and hard livers. We have a

76
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
very large pre-clinical data set that

77
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,800
supports our ability to get these

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,480
apatocytes to engraft and function in

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
terms of our pipeline. So our first drug

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,239
that we'll take into the clinic uh we'll

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,640
be dosing our patients next year. That's

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,400
in pediatric ura cycle disorders. These

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
are patients that are born without a

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,760
functioning liver and they need a boost

85
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,360
in their function to protect their brain

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,920
until they're old enough to receive a

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
gene therapy or receive a transplant.

88
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,040
And that hypermia that's the blood

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
toxins that build up. That's the

90
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
unifying theme for our pipeline. Our

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,120
next drug is for adult patients

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,040
suffering from apatic sephylopathy where

93
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
we begin grafting the cells outside of

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
the liver. We have a very robust CMC

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,920
package. Cryopreserve drugs. They're

96
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
centrally manufactured, shipped around

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,680
the world for our clinical trials and to

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,920
customers. We have very low cost of

99
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360
goods uh due to the engine cost

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,440
engineering that we've implemented along

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,159
with our innovation uh when we've

102
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
developed the biology and the drugs. The

103
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,200
kind of partnership opportunities we're

104
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,040
looking for. So co-development

105
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,120
partnerships, we as we approach our

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
first multinational clinical trial, we

107
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
have clinical sites around the world and

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,400
some that are coming to us through

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,000
partner interest. We also have

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
outlicicensing interests and in

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
discussions that we're um interested in

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
having with folks around our rare

113
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
disease uh indication and then uh and

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
then our adult indications of

115
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,560
pre-clinical partnership opportunity.

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
And we just always take a moment to

117
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
acknowledge the donors because we are

118
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,760
using cells derived from from organ

119
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,599
donors and we're committed to delivering

120
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,599
these therapies to patients in need.

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,480
Thank you, Tom.

122
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
So, um, let me start with, um, if you

123
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
could expand a little more. You're

124
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,439
touching on partnerships, but for

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,759
bioarma companies, what what are you

126
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,600
looking for? What would work best?

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
>> Yeah. So, so yeah, biotech or pharma

128
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,560
companies that have a focus in um liver

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,280
disease or metabolic diseases, genetic

130
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,199
diseases, uh rare diseases or cell

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,040
therapy, particularly if they already

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
have a um a commercial footprint with a

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,880
sales force that's calling on hospitals

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
and those those indications, those could

135
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,960
be very interesting. Our drugs very much

136
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
unlike a typical cell therapy, it's off

137
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,759
the shelf and availably shipped and

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
treated like a traditional drug.

139
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
>> And I was just going to touch on that.

140
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,520
What's your your competitive advantage?

141
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,639
Can you expand a little more on that

142
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,080
what you're saying?

143
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,560
>> Yeah, competitive advantage. So, there's

144
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,639
there's no other uh cell source for

145
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
liver cells. So, we're really the only

146
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,040
one that has a full GMP cell source

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,199
that's scalable and ready to be able to

148
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,960
be used. And then it's offtheshelf carb

149
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,479
reserve and extremely low cost of goods.

150
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
So, we're talking single-digit thousands

151
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,759
of dollars. Typically, cell therapies

152
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
are in the hundreds of thousands of

153
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,000
dollars or higher.

154
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,240
>> Thank you for that. And one final

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,800
question, how long does the administered

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
cells live in the body?

157
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,960
>> Yep. So the our first clinical trial

158
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
will have a six-month endpoint. Uh we

159
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,800
expect that we'll be able to go out

160
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
multiple years, but in order to have a a

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
streamlined clinical development pathway

162
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,880
and bring value to these patients, the

163
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
the first trials will be six months.
