1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,599
Um the session one is framing the

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,520
challenge and we're going to go as high

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,320
level as we can looking at the whole

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,080
world and all of humanity.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,160
And um I I couldn't be more excited

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,840
about the three speakers. Um I

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,359
I will not do them justice by

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,719
introducing. So I'm asking each of them

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,920
to take a moment to introduce

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,120
themselves. And uh we're going to start

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,040
with Jason J from here at MIT Sloan

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,920
School. Um who has I will just add one

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
one piece of introduction. He has the uh

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,239
incredible distinction which I I don't

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,520
know if it's on on your LinkedIn but of

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,440
being a early heat volunteer for an

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
energy efficiency barn raising.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,039
>> That's right. I learned how to use a

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,640
cocking gun from Zanb. Um

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,479
um good morning everybody.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
>> Good morning everybody.

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,040
>> All right. Um so I'm Jason Jay. I teach

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,799
I'm the director of the sustainability

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,119
initiative there. Um, I've had the great

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,280
pleasure to be part of this heat journey

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,520
from the beginning. As Zanab was saying,

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
I when I did my PhD here, I was studying

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,960
something called the Cambridge Energy

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
Alliance. Um, and I was looking at the

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,200
sort of multistakeholder collaborations

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,880
that were occurring here um, around our

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,479
our our city of Cambridge advancing

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
energy efficiency topics. And part of

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,400
that included participating in HEAT's

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,200
early barn raisings. And I did in fact

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,119
learn to use a cocking gun from Zanab

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
um, as we were weatherizing people's

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,320
homes. Um and then and then have gotten

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,280
to watch as this whole thing has evolved

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,840
um going to the gas leaks effort, the

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,240
collaboration with um Eversource and

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
other utility companies um the

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
advancement of the legal policy

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,840
framework around better measurement of

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,079
gas leaks and then towards this this

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
transformational idea of geothermal

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,640
energy networks where now there's enough

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
trust between the advocates and the

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,039
utilities to actually say, "Hey, could

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
we just not have you be a gas utility

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,480
anymore?" which is kind of an audacious

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,319
thing and is the reason we bring in Zanb

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,879
as a guest speaker into our courses uh

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,520
every year. Um what she asked me to do

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,280
is to um as she said go to the level of

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
the of all of the whole planet and all

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,760
of humanity. Um and the way I'm going to

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,239
do that is using an interactive

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,520
simulation tool called NROSS. Um just

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
quick show of hands, how many of you

62
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,840
have seen NROs before? Okay. Uh about

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,840
half the room. Okay. So um this is the

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,319
the result of a collaboration between

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,120
the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,519
and uh Climate Interactive which is a

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,440
independent uh nonpartisan nonprofit

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:55,360
made of mostly MIT grads um who um who

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,680
do a simulation tool that behaves the

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,160
same as the big supercomputer integrated

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
assessment models but runs instantly on

72
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,159
any laptop and is freely available and

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
open source to anybody with a web

74
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,560
browser. So, um you can't open it up on

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
your phones, but on any laptop or iPad,

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,000
um you can pull this up and experiment

77
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,840
it with it yourself. And um I am not on

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
the modeling team. I'm not a climate

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
scientist. I'm not an energy scientist.

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm an organizations person, but I've

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,599
been facilitating probably hundreds of

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
workshops at this point using this tool.

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,440
And that means that any of you can do

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
that as well. Um which which I would

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,000
certainly recommend. What I'm going to

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,159
try to do is just use this to expose a

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
little bit about the climate challenge

88
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,159
um and how the things that we're talking

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,080
about here today sort of fit within that

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,000
bigger picture and what some of the

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
system interactions are because this is

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,040
a system dynamics model right this is

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,959
the interdependence of um you know

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,280
thousands of variables to produce the

95
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,360
outcomes that we are facing. So here you

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,159
can see on the left this is the stack of

97
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,400
global energy. Um so she talked about a

98
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,599
zeta jewel that humanity is using about

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,439
half of a zeta jewel. So 500 exogles. Um

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,080
you can see that here on this picture

101
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,560
and that is made up of coal, oil, gas,

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,799
renewables, biomass and nuclear. Um uh

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,320
if we were to invent nuclear fusion or

104
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,600
some other new zerocarbon, we could add

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,239
that to the mix. We're not going to talk

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,400
about that today. On the right we have

107
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,800
the stack of greenhouse gas emissions

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,520
that are partly related to that. So the

109
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,479
largest source of human anthropogenic

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,080
greenhouse gas emissions is uh CO2 from

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,320
energy. That's about 35 gigatons uh a

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,840
year right now. The second highest

113
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,240
source is methane. So this is put on a

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,600
100redyear uh CO2 equivalent units on

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,919
this graph. So 10 gigatons of CO2

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
equivalent from methane emissions. The

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,160
third highest is land use change from

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,160
deforestation and petlands and so on.

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
And then you have nitrous oxide and F

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,520
gases. So this gives you a picture of

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,080
the faucet into the bathtub of the

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,240
atmosphere. How much greenhouse gas we

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,600
are putting into the atmosphere every

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,440
year. And the result of that faucet

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
being on stronger and stronger every

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,120
year as we grow the global industrial

127
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,440
economy is that the concentration of CO2

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
in the atmosphere is increasing. Um

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,520
right, we you've heard 350.org or

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
wanting to get that back down to 350

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,919
closer to pre-industrial levels. um

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,800
we're now at about 424 and that

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,240
increasing greenhouse gas as Zanv said

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
creates this thermal regulation problem

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,440
which is that we're heating the planet

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,440
and so the temperature um is increasing

137
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,880
um in 2024

138
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,400
um you know the data is still coming in

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,360
but we're really pushing close to that

140
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,479
1.5 mark um and you can see in our

141
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,120
business as usual projections um inroads

142
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,520
we passed the 1.5 degree goal we passed

143
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,400
the twoderee goal we at the end of the

144
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,960
century hit 3.3° C, which is what this

145
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
big number is. And unfortunately, the

146
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,639
slope of this line is positive, which

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,840
means that we're continuing to warm the

148
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,479
planet into the 22nd century. Um, not

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,639
everybody has a visceral sense of what

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,960
3.3 degrees Celsius means. Um, and so

151
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,479
one thing you can do is you can use the

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,120
impact graphs in NROS to explore some of

153
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,960
that. So for example, we can think about

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,759
you know how much sea level rise might

155
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,400
we see as a result of that warming or we

156
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,840
can think about um you know other graphs

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,479
like um the extinction risk from animal

158
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
species. So the effects on biodiversity.

159
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,280
Um, one of the things that if you

160
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
haven't played with Androids in a little

161
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,520
while, we've now added is that we

162
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,000
interface with maps that are from the

163
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,160
um, probable futures site, which allows

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,960
you to see what happens kind of on a

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,960
more regional or geographic basis to the

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,160
places that we care about. So, for

167
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,000
example, this is a picture of the number

168
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,880
of extreme humidity and heat days. So,

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,319
um, how many days per year do we have

170
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,240
with wet bulb temperatures, um, above 26

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,400
degrees C, which is where you start to

172
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,680
have really serious health consequences

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,680
of outdoor work, outdoor sports, um, and

174
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,919
if you don't have cooling in your home,

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
um, just even sleeping at night. So, um,

176
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,199
you can see that the southeast of the

177
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,840
United States starts to have really dire

178
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,840
conditions. Um, but and and you can back

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,080
this off by year and sort of see how

180
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,639
this evolves. So here's where we were in

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,880
2000 um in terms of the frequency of

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,560
those ultra high heat days and you can

183
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,240
see that um that's all uh increasing um

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,000
you know throughout the throughout North

185
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
America and of course if we look at

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,639
other geographies in the world in

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
subsaharan Africa um where my wife's

188
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,840
family is in India um in in uh in uh in

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,120
uh the eastern part in West Bengal you

190
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,360
can see that there's very serious

191
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,759
consequences and so what this means is

192
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,160
that we have to learn how to cool our

193
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,520
buildings things fast and quickly and

194
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,840
cheaply and low carbon. Um, and so that

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,280
demand for cooling is a big piece of the

196
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,360
the puzzle of what we're going to be

197
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,080
grappling with. So that's one thing just

198
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,680
to kind of be oriented to what is the

199
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,800
challenge and why are we trying to solve

200
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,560
for more efficient lowcarbon um methods

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,440
for doing um uh heating and cooling. Um

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
now the um the other thing couple other

203
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,120
things I wanted to just kind of

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,840
illuminate here. Um so one is that um

205
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,720
you know the methane as a significant

206
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039
source of greenhouse gases this lever

207
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,560
here which is about the waste um oop

208
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,640
sorry I'm not used to windows um can I

209
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,399
make that go away? Okay good um this

210
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,760
lever over here which is about the waste

211
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,360
and leakage of um non CO2 greenhouse

212
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,519
gases. So if we look at methane in

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,399
particular um what you can see here is

214
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,839
that people talk about methane a when we

215
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,120
talk about methane oftentimes we talk

216
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,040
about cows and agricultural sources and

217
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,279
that is very important. You can see the

218
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,360
agricultural methane emissions but what

219
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,920
a lot of people don't think about is the

220
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,399
fact that a very significant part of our

221
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
methane emissions um you know this is

222
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,800
you know depending on the time horizon

223
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
you know 50 60 times stronger than CO2

224
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,519
um do significantly come from energy

225
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,600
production. So when we can move away

226
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,839
from coal which leaks methane out of the

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,000
mines, gas which leaks methane across

228
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,959
the value chain and oil which leaks

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,080
methane at the drilling sites um and in

230
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,120
the refineries um we can work on this

231
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,040
chunk right. So if we if we can if we

232
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,680
can decrease methane leakage from the

233
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,000
energy systems which was you know heat's

234
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,440
first major effort. Yeah. Okay. So you

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,279
can see this this bent the curve a

236
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
little bit here. And if I just do a

237
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,320
little um replay, you can see the

238
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,880
change. So that um that bending of that

239
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,519
curve of of energy leakage is one

240
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,760
opportunity. But if we can get off of

241
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,760
those of fossil fuels entirely, for

242
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,600
example, by um you know, pricing CO2 um

243
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
and doing things that are that that

244
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,640
allow us to decarbonize energy supply,

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,120
what you'll see is that those um those

246
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,640
methane uh emissions from energy go down

247
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
even further. So there's sort of a

248
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
two-prong approach here, which is to

249
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,399
reduce the leakage from the system that

250
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,480
we have, which is the original gas leaks

251
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,680
idea. And then there's the question of

252
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,399
how do we transition away from these um

253
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,000
highcarbon sources of energy? Um I'm

254
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,959
just going to revert back without those

255
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,440
changes and just say that. So then the

256
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,560
question is, well, how might we simulate

257
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
the effects of doing district geothermal

258
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,279
like we're going to be talking about the

259
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,560
next couple of days? And what I'll say

260
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,440
is that that's a blind spot in tools

261
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,440
like this because um as the first thing

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
as Adam said today was that so much of

263
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,000
our attention has been on electricity

264
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
and light. We don't tend to think about

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,079
thermal energy and I'll say that that's

266
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,519
also the case for nodes. There is

267
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,480
geothermal built into what we define as

268
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,560
renewables. Um so that when you're you

269
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
know you know subsidizing renewables or

270
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,200
you're doing other moves like uh carbon

271
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,240
pricing that do transition toward a

272
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,560
renewable world that does include if you

273
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,720
look at the details geothermal but it's

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,720
largely thinking about that first bucket

275
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,320
in her um in her graph of the um using

276
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
geo using like the super high

277
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,279
temperature geothermal to generate

278
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,320
electricity. We're not really dealing

279
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,720
with it um from a heat standpoint. The

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,440
best way for us to represent that is for

281
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,279
us to think about electrifying the

282
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
building and industry space because what

283
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,279
you're doing is you're often moving to

284
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,920
some kind of a heat pump, a geothermal

285
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,000
heat pump um in lie of a um but you're

286
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,880
also doing that in a far more energy

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,120
efficient way than um than you'd be

288
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,640
doing otherwise with fossil fuels. So

289
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,640
this is a this is a kind of an energy

290
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,320
efficiency and electrification play

291
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,320
which are you know important pieces of

292
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,480
the puzzle. Um, the last thing I'll just

293
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
say is that when you're anytime you're

294
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,200
electrifying something, of course you'll

295
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,560
have to and and you'll notice if you

296
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
play with NROs that electrifying

297
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,639
transport doesn't have a huge effect on

298
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,079
the climate. Electrifying building an

299
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,680
industry by itself doesn't have a huge

300
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,560
effect on the climate. And part of that

301
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,480
is because you're not decarbonizing the

302
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,600
energy, the electricity supply. So you

303
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,279
have to make sure that if you're running

304
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,920
those heat pumps, you're running them

305
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,800
off of lowcarbon electricity. And that's

306
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,680
another system interaction. So if you

307
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,279
can do things like uh you know stop

308
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,120
building new coal plants and therefore

309
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,720
um you know work toward kind of that

310
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,600
decarbonization of the electricity

311
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,240
system. If you you know do some really

312
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,880
heavily heavy kind of um reductions

313
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,680
either technologically or uh or through

314
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,279
policy to reduce natural gas and so on

315
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,079
then you're decarbonizing electricity

316
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,839
supply then the electrifification

317
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,600
actually has more of an impact on the

318
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
climate. So just to say that these

319
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,560
systems are interactive and we want to

320
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
think about um as we are going and

321
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,320
trying to solve these thermal heating

322
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,560
problems that we do it in as renewably

323
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,800
powered a way as possible. But also just

324
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,800
that there are blind spots in so many of

325
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,959
these modeling tools and so many of

326
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,279
these policy discussions given the

327
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,279
general tendency to focus very heavily

328
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,079
on uh electricity.

329
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,240
Is that what you want me to cover?

330
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,600
Um, oh and I'll just say one one more

331
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,000
thing which is that of course AI and it

332
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,680
data center growth is driving you know

333
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,519
increase in all of these parameters in

334
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,040
terms of energy usage. So we have to do

335
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,000
everything that much harder and that

336
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,360
much faster. Um now hopefully the AI and

337
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,399
the machine learning can help us and

338
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
we're going to talk about the ways that

339
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,680
advanced analytics can help us identify

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,760
geothermal opportunities and optimize

341
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,760
for them. But just notice just

342
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,680
remembering whenever we talk about those

343
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
types of computational things, we always

344
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,720
want to think about the foot the

345
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
handprint and the footprint of those

346
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
technologies.

347
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,600
>> Okay,

348
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,380
>> thank you so much.

349
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:00,240
>> Oh my gosh, that was amazing. And

350
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:02,160
[Applause]

351
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
>> all right, that that was amazing. And

352
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,839
now And now we have to talk afterwards

353
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,560
about getting geothermal in there with a

354
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,560
little toggle switch. Yeah.
