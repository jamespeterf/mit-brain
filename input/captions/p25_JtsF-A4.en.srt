[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:16,694
 

3
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:21,113
ARMSTRONG: Houston,
Tranquility Base here.

4
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:22,885
The eagle has landed.

5
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:24,368
DUKE: Roger, Tranquility.

6
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:25,107
We copy--

7
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,690
SPEAKER 1: It was
pretty inspirational

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,910
for me to see the moon landings.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,460
Even though I was
only five years old,

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,220
I remember it very distinctly.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,250
SPEAKER 2: I started
this whole journey

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,120
wanting to be an astronaut.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,229
And I became addicted to flying.

14
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,020
And all I wanted to do
was fly all the time

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,770
and became so passionate
about aviation.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,700
WOOD: So I was able to be at

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Kennedy Space Center in 1999

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,820
when the Chandra space telescope was launched.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,830
And it was a nighttime launch.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,080
It was absolutely gorgeous.

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,099
The whole sky
looked like daytime.

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,259
And that mission was
the very first mission

23
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:08,800
where a woman was actually the
commander of the Space Shuttle

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,555
mission.

25
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:11,950
It was inspiring.

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,750
 

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,040
NARRATOR: MIT'S
first female graduate

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,780
in aeronautical
engineering, now AeroAstro,

29
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,430
was Isabel Abel, class of 1932.

30
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,070
While still a
student, Abel helped

31
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,600
Amelia Earhart become the first
woman to fly the Atlantic solo.

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,620
But it would be
another seven years

33
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,880
before anyone in the aircraft
industry would hire her,

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,180
at which point her
career took off.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,500
I have found on the
whole, she said,

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,200
that once the original
barrier is down,

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,960
women are well-accepted.

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,620
MIT's AeroAstro women
have been knocking down

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,660
barriers ever since.

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,810
WIDNALL: My father
rode bulls in the rodeo

41
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,130
and my mother was a
juvenile probation officer.

42
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,380
So it sort of gave me a
certain leadership style,

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,320
willingness to assert oneself.

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,840
I came to MIT as a freshman
in 1956, one of 23 women

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,570
entering the Institute.

46
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,470
It didn't feel like a
welcoming place for women,

47
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,710
and I made a kind of
conscious decision

48
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,330
that I would worry
about that later.

49
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,000
 

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,070
But as I moved into
the department,

51
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,460
I got a lot of really
good support from faculty.

52
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,630
NARRATOR: Sheila Widnall rose to
a host of influential positions

53
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,780
at MIT and beyond,
including Vice President

54
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,580
of the Academy of
Engineering and President

55
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,640
of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,890
In 1993, she became the first
woman Secretary of the Air

57
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,450
Force, serving for four years.

58
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,370
Throughout her
career, she's played

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,100
a pivotal role in the
advancement of women at MIT.

60
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,960
WIDNALL: If we look at the
history of women at MIT,

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,520
it's a set of steps.

62
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,420
It's not a smooth ramp.

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,070
It's up, then we do something
else and we go along,

64
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,940
and we do something else.

65
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,645
It's an issue that you just have
to keep on the front burner.

66
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,270
NEWMAN: Science and
engineering are not

67
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,440
the domain of any one gender.

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,481
We're equally good at it.

69
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,410
And I always think putting men and women

70
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,100
and just diversity of all types really

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,170
helps us come up with different solutions.

72
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,550
I had never been taught
by a female engineer.

73
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,410
So, but there's a lot
you can learn from that.

74
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,350
I was taught by plenty of
wonderful male engineers.

75
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,880
I learned a lot from them.

76
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,140
But I think it also fueled
my passion a little bit

77
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,660
to serve as a role
model and to make sure

78
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,957
that girls thought that this
was absolutely a career.

79
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:51,540
An aerospace engineer,
that's not just

80
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,340
for men, that's for
girls and boys alike.

81
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,527
My BioSuit research is just
a great example of that.

82
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,360
So that's a kind of a
revolutionary approach

83
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,955
to a new spacesuit design.

84
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:01,930
It looks like a Spiderman suit.

85
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,610
That wasn't just for
aesthetic reasons.

86
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,026
I'm applying the
pressure directly

87
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,690
to my skin to give
you a full mobility.

88
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,600
You can climb, you can bend.

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,710
If Rachel could come out.

90
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,240
Rachel Foreman,
graduate student, MIT,

91
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,296
is going to model the
BioSuit for you here.

92
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:19,471
As soon as I did this second
skin or this shrink wrap, now

93
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:21,470
you can tell the difference
between the genders.

94
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,060
So now there's a female suit
and there's a male suit.

95
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,890
And I was overwhelmed, and
I still am, by young girls

96
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,930
that are so excited
about this space suit,

97
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,880
but it's a space
suit for girls now.

98
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,470
And it makes a great
connection with them

99
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,780
and they say, maybe I
can think about being

100
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,570
an aerospace engineer.

101
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,900
At MIT, 48% of our
undergraduates are female now.

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,840
That's quite a difference from
just a decade and definitely

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,235
two and three decades ago.

104
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:53,800
 

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,890
URANGA: We are not many
women in AeroAstro.

106
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,190
It's fine.

107
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,880
Probably the main thing, difference between MIT

108
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,500
and any other place I've seen, people

109
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
are valued for their ideas.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,420
Not for who says it.

111
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,910
LOHMEYER: I think there's
still some improvement that

112
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,720
can be made.

113
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,730
We can definitely boost the numbers.

114
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,840
But I think what is different is definitely

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,105
the sense of community
and sense of belonging.

116
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,480
And maybe if you
have a day where

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,082
you don't feel like
you belong, you

118
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:29,290
can find someone that you
can talk about those things

119
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,500
with, whereas before maybe
it wasn't as possible.

120
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,950
BUCHIBABU: I think being a woman
in this field is actually fun.

121
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,780
It's fun being a minority, believe it or not.

122
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,910
You're more memorable.

123
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,600
You're more recognizable.

124
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,970
And you're also more relatable.

125
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,790
People tend to come talk to you
first, and that's kind of nice.

126
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,980
And I think it's fun being
in that kind of environment.

127
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,610
So that's also my
other motivation

128
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,090
in being in this area.

129
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,000
And kind of bossing around
the boys, that's fun too.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,190
