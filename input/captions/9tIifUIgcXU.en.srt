00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,119
hello Within the Music 21 Corpus there's

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,039
another subcorpus which is a pretty

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,760
useful one and that is the Corpus of the

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:25,480
complete corals of jsbach I'm really

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,519
thankful to Margaret Green Tree who

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,679
contributed all of these before her

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,960
untimely passing so within music 21

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,600
let's go ahead and import Corpus because

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,520
that's going to be pretty useful

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,480
and we

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,120
can have within the Corpus a sign called

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,640
Corpus doc

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,399
corals and see that there and there's a

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,840
sign called the Corpus Coral's iterator

15
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:56,399
which will go through this and so we can

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,640
say for Coral in the Corpus Coral

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:04,040
iterator print Coral do metadata that's

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,200
the data about the data the data about

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,119
the piece and we can print its title and

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,080
it's going through and it's a little bit

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,880
slow because it's actually parsing them

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,720
and along the way as it's going that'll

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,119
take some time so you can go ahead and

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,400
interrupt that uh while it's going so

25
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,400
not every Corral has four parts so

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,159
sometimes as we want to do um if

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,799
Coral L

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,200
Coral or spell

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,119
Parts not equals 4 will

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,640
continue then let's do this let's print

31
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,600
Coral

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,159
metadata title and we'll

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,399
say that we just put a call in at the

34
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:56,479
end and then for I in range 4 012 3

35
00:01:51,399 --> 00:02:00,479
right P equals coral. Parts

36
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,479
I print

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:11,039
I and then the the length of P do flat.

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,959
notes we curse will be a little faster

39
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,720
but we'll have to do that and we'll

40
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:22,000
say the end of that

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:25,720
is let's I'll put comma space something

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,599
like that and now we can go through oops

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,280
or interrupt

44
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,280
that I think it's probably useful to

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,239
print a new line afterwards and we can

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,760
kind of see how the various parts are

47
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,920
and you can imagine that you can go

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,680
through this and play with it and have

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,200
um so interesting things on which parts

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,760
have more notes and which parts have

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
fewer notes and so

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,440
on some of the things that we could do

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,599
with a complete Corpus of crows are look

54
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:04,000
at the types of motion where do climaxes

55
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:08,080
appear here where can uh

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,440
we find uh repeats uh what are the kinds

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,440
of time signatures that appear in Cals

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,440
basically all the things that you guys

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,519
did uh in problem set three which is

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,840
just wonderful um or probably yeah to

61
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,080
talk about what you can do with the

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,760
Corpus corals so this is the coral

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,319
Corpus if you want to quickly go through

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,159
and just find particular ones you can

65
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,159
say that the

66
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:39,319
return type is something else uh file

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,480
name and this will allow you to pass

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,879
them into the converter

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,079
if1

70
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,519
one in

71
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,280
Coral real

72
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,280
Coral equals Corpus

73
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,280
parse

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,920
C and there are all the CRS with 11 in

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,880
the name so these are just some things

76
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,600
that you could um be working with and

77
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,040
you can even this is a small enough

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,800
number we can show each of

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,840
them and I'll take a little bit of time

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,000
but we'll start getting to see all all

81
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,160
the crows in a

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,160
piece our friends at Intel bum bum bum

83
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,919
bum have created a tutorial on how you

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,160
can use B Cals and work through the

85
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,320
iterators and explore the data and begin

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,479
looking on emotion recognition and so on

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,120
from the bach corals and even do

88
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,160
artificial intelligence and plot various

89
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,160
things we'll show you this in a second

90
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,440
and Pitch throughout tie very short

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,440
video thanks for watching
