00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,119
carbon dioxide CO2 is a major

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,960
contributor to climate change and a

6
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,439
significant product of many human

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,720
activities notably industrial

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,640
manufacturing a major goal in the energy

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,199
field has been to chemically convert

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,640
emitted CO2 into valuable chemicals or

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,679
fuels but while CO2 is available in

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,040
abundance it has not yet been widely

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,920
used to generate value added products

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,760
why not the reason is that CO2 molecules

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,559
are highly stable and therefore not

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,039
prone to being chemically converted to a

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,879
different form researchers have sought

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,079
materials and device designs that could

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,600
help spur that conversion but nothing

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,399
has worked well enough to yield an

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,640
efficient costeffective system two years

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,600

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,920
professor of chemical engineering at MIT

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,800
decided to try using something different

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,720
a material that gets more attention in

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,119
discussions of biology than of chemical

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,000
engineering already results from work in

29
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,880
her lab suggests that her unusual

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,560
approach is paying

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,840
off the stumbling

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,759
block the challenge begins with the

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,759
first step in the CO2 conversion process

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
before being transformed into a useful

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,360
product CO2 must be chemically converted

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,880
into carbon monoxide

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,560
Co that conversion can be encouraged

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,479
using electrochemistry

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,399
a process in which input voltage

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,360
provides the extra energy needed to make

41
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,640
the stable CO2 molecules react the

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,439
problem is that achieving the CO2 to co

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,119
conversion requires large energy inputs

44
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,360
and even then Co makes up only a small

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,280
fraction of the products that are formed

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,560
to explore opportunities for improving

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
this process first in her research group

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,600
focus on the electric Catalyst a

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
material that enhances the rate of a

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,439
chemical reaction without being consumed

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,840
in the process the catalyst is key to

52
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,200
successful operation inside an

53
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,759
electrochemical device the catalyst is

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,319
often suspended in an aquous water-based

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,480
solution when an electric potential

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,480
essentially a voltage is applied to a

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,560
submerged electrode dissolve CO2 will

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,640
helped by the Catalyst be converted to

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,959
co but there's one stumbling block the

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
Catalyst and the CO2 must meet on the

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,400
surface of the electrode for the

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,599
reaction to occur in some studies the

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,840
catalyst is dispersed in the solution

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,560
but that approach requires more Catalyst

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,720
and isn't very efficient according to

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,400
first you have to both wait for the

67
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,120
diffusion of CO2 to the Catalyst and for

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
the Catalyst to reach the electrode

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,720
before the reaction can occur she

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,519
explains as a result researchers

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,519
worldwide have been exploring different

72
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,560
methods of immobilizing the Catalyst on

73
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,959
the

74
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,239
electrode connecting the Catalyst and

75
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,840
the

76
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,000
electrode before F could delve into that

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
challenge she needed to decide which of

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,680
the two types of CO2 conversion Catalyst

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,200
to work with the traditional solid state

80
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,799
Catalyst or a catalyst made up of small

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,519
molecules in examining the literature

82
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,799
she concluded that small molecule

83
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,640
catalysts held the most promise while

84
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,040
their conversion efficiency tends to be

85
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,120
lower than that of solid state versions

86
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,560
molecular catalysts offer one important

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,360
Advantage they can be tuned to emphasize

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
reactions and products of Interest two

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,840
approaches are commonly used to

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,080
immobilize small molecule catalysts on

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,239
an electrode one involves linking the

92
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,519
Catalyst to electrode by strong calent

93
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,439
bonds a type of bond in which atoms

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,720
share electrons the result is a strong

95
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,840
essentially permanent connection the

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,959
other sets up a non-covalent attachment

97
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,239
between the Catalyst and the electrode

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,840
unlike a calent bond this connection can

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,519
easily be broken neither approach is

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,879
ideal in the former case the Catalyst

101
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,959
electrode are firmly attached ensuring

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,640
efficient reactions but when the

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
activity of the Catalyst degrades over

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
time which it will the electrode can no

105
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,599
longer be accessed

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,120
in the latter case a degraded Catalyst

107
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,120
can be removed but the exact placement

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,319
of The small molecules of the Catalyst

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
on the electrode can't be controlled

110
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,879
leading to an inconsistent often

111
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
decreasing catalytic efficiency and

112
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,239
simply increasing the amount of catalyst

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
on the electrode surface without concern

114
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,720
for where the molecules are placed

115
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,560
doesn't solve the problem what was

116
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,240
needed was a way to position the small

117
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,440
molecule Catalyst firmly and accurately

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,160
on the electrode and then release it

119
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,479
when it degrades for that task first

120
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,360
turn to what she and her team regard as

121
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,479
a kind of programmable molecular velcro

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,160
deoxy ribonucleic acid or

123
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,240
DNA adding DNA to the

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,240
mix mention DNA to most people and they

125
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,639
think of biological functions in living

126
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,680
things but the members of first lab view

127
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,120
DNA as more than just genetic code DNA

128
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,160
has these really cool physical

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,680
properties as a biomaterial that people

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,680
don't often think about she says DNA can

131
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,360
be used as a molecular velcro that can

132
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,960
stick things together with very high

133
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,880
Precision first knew that DNA sequences

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,560
had previously been used to immobilize

135
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,759
molecules on surfaces for other purposes

136
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,600
so she devised a plan to use DNA to

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,280
direct the immobilization of catalyst

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,440
for CO2 conversion her approach depends

139
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,039
on a well understood behavior of DNA

140
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,240
called hybridization The Familiar DNA

141
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,720
structure is a double helix that forms

142
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,560
when two complimentary strands connect

143
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,680
when the sequence of bases the four

144
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,240
building blocks of DNA and the indiv

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,720
idual strands match up hydrogen bonds

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,160
form between complimentary bases firmly

147
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
linking the strands together using that

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,360
behavior for Catalyst immobilization

149
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,280
involves two steps first the researchers

150
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,280
attach a single strand of DNA to the

151
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,080
electrode then they attach a

152
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,240
complimentary strand to the Catalyst

153
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,600
that is floating in the aquous solution

154
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,440
when the latter strand gets near the

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,720
former the two strands hybridize they

156
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,120
become linked by multiple hydrogen bonds

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,360
between properly paired bases as a

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,080
result the catalyst is firmly affixed to

159
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,840
the electrode by means of two

160
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,720
interlocked self assembled DNA strands

161
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,400
one connected to the electrode and the

162
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,280
other to the Catalyst better still the

163
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,639
two strands can be detached from one

164
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,520
another the connection is stable but if

165
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,400
we heat it up we can remove the

166
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,240
secondary strand that has the Catalyst

167
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,240
on it says first so we can

168
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,080
dehybridized surfaces without having to

169
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,599
disassemble the device or do any harsh

170
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,280
chemical steps

171
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,680
experimental

172
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,280

compounds that are biologically

180
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,280
important for processes ranging from

181

enzyme activity to oxygen transport two

182
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,120
of the catalysts involve a synthetic

kind of inspired by Nature comments

first in their experiments the

191
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,479
researchers first needed to modify

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,080
single strands of DNA and deposit them

193
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,240
on one of the electrodes submerged in

194
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,440
the solution inside their

195
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,360
electrochemical cell though this sounds

196
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,120
straightforward it did require some new

197
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,960
chemistry led by carar in thirdy year

198
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,039
undergr graduate researcher Rachel alar

199
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,080
the team developed a fast easy way to

200
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,000
attach DNA to electrodes for this work

201
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,120
the researchers Focus was on attaching

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,039
DNA but the tethering chemistry they

203
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,479
developed can also be used to attach

204
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,120
enzymes protein catalysts and first

205
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,400
believes it will be highly useful as a

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,560
general strategy for modifying carbon

207
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,240
electrodes once the single strands of

208
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,120
DNA were deposited on the electrode the

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
researcher synthesized complimentary

210
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,639
strands and attached them to one of the

211
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,199
three catalysts when the DNA strands

212
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
with the Catalyst were added to the

213
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,440
solution in the electrochemical cell

214
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,919
they readily hybridized with the DNA

215
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,000
strands on the electrode after half an

216
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,000
hour the researchers applied a voltage

217
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,759
to the electrode to chemically convert

218
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,159
CO2 dissolved in the solution and used a

219
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,960
gas chromatograph to analyze the makeup

220
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,919
of the gases produced by the conversion

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,680
the team found that when the DNA linked

222
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,520
catalysts were freely dispersed in the

223
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,080
solution they were highly soluble even

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,919
when they included small molecule

225
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,440
catalyst that don't dissolve in water on

226
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,240
their own indeed while pfer and base

227
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,159
Catalyst and solution often stick

228
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,200
together once the DNA strands were

229
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,959
attached that counterproductive Behavior

230
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
was no longer evident the DNA linked

231
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,480
Catalyst and solution were also more

232
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
stable than their unmodified

233
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,200
counterparts they didn't degrade at

234
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,920
voltages that caused the unmodified

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
catalus to degrade so just attaching

236
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,959
that single stranded DNA to the Catalyst

237
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,279
in solution makes this Catalyst more

238
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,959
stable says first we don't even have to

239
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,760
put them on the electrod surface to see

240
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,920
improve stability when converting CO2 in

241
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,560
this way a stable Catalyst will give a

242
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,440
steady current over time experimental

243
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,360
results show that adding the DNA

244
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,320
prevented the Catalyst from degrading it

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,079
voltages of interest for practical

246
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,079
devices moreover with all three

247
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,399
catalysts in solution the DNA

248
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,079
modification significantly increased the

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,959
production of Co per minute allowing the

250
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,880
DNA linked Catalyst to hybridize with

251
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
the DNA connected to electrode brought

252
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,000
further improvements even compared to

253
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,320
the same DNA linked Catalyst in solution

254
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,839
for example as a result of the DNA

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,920
directed assembly the Catalyst ended up

256
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,399
firmly attached to the electrode and the

257
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,440
Catalyst stability was further enhanced

258
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,519
despite being highly soluble in aquous

259
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
Solutions the DNA linked Catalyst

260
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,480
molecules remained hybridized at the

261
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,880
surface of the electrode even under

262
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,880
harsh experimental conditions

263
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,959
immobilizing the DNA linked Catalyst and

264
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,640
Electrode also significantly increased

265
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,800
the rate of Co production in a series of

266
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,440
experiments the researchers monitored

267
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,160
the co production rate with each of

268
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,040
their catalysts in solution without

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,120
attached DNA strands the conventional

270
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,480
setup and then with them immobilized by

271
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,800
DNA on the electrode with all three

272
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,920
catalysts the amount of Co generated per

273
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,680
minute was Far higher when the DNA

274
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,320
linked Catalyst was immobilized on the

275
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,360
electrode in addition immobilizing the

276
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,079
DNA linked Catalyst on the electrode

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
greatly increased the selectivity in

278
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,279
terms of the products one persistent

279
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,120
challenge in using CO2 to generate Co in

280
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,000
aquous Solutions is that there is an

281
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,000
inevitable competition between the

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,320
formation of Co and the formation of

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,800
hydrogen that tendency was eased by

284
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,800
adding DNA to the Catalyst in solution

285
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,440
and even more so when the Catalyst was

286
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,600
immobilized on the electrode using DNA

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,959
for both the Cobalt poring Catalyst and

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,200
the humm based Catalyst the formation of

289
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,279
Co relative to hydrogen was

290
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,920
significantly higher with the DNA linked

291
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,000
Catalyst on the electrode than in

292
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,360
solution with the iron porer and

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,040
Catalyst they were about the same with

294
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,839
the iron it doesn't matter whether it's

295
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,120
in solution or on the electrode first

296
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,079
explains both of them have selectivity

297
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,519
for Co so that's good

298
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,920
too progress and

299
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,639
plans first and her team have now

300
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,560
demonstrated that their DNA based

301
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,519
approach combines the advantages of the

302
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,839
traditional solid state Catalyst and the

303
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,760
newer small molecule ones in their

304
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,279
experiments they achieved the highly

305
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,000
efficient chemical conversion of CO2 to

306
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,160
co and also were able to control the mix

307
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,360
of products formed and they believe that

308
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,040
their technique should prove scalable

309
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,839
DNA is inexpensive and widely available

310
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,680
and the amount of catalyst required is

311
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,279
several orders of magnitude lower when

312
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,800
it's immobilized using DNA based on her

313
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,519
work thus far first hypothesizes that

314
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,639
the structure and spacing of The small

315
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,760
molecules on the electrode May directly

316
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,519
impact both catalytic efficiency and

317
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,320
product selectivity using DNA to control

318
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,920
the precise positioning of her small

319
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,639
molecule Catalyst she plans to evaluate

320
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,560
those impacts and then extrapolate

321
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
design parameters that can be applied to

322
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,959
other classes of energy conversion

323
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,720
catalysts ultimately she hopes to

324
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,440
develop a predictive algorithm the

325
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,440
researchers can use as they Design

326
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,360
