00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
There are a couple different kinds of

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,920
quantum computers. The most general is a

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,759
universal fault tolerant quantum

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,840
computer. In principle, this computer

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,440
can run any type of algorithm, quantum

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,960
or classical. But there only certain

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,799
algorithms that are known to exhibit a

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,720
quantum advantage. One example is Shor's

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
factoring algorithm. Shor's algorithm is

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,800
used to break public key cryptography.

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,160
For example, RSA encryption, a scheme

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
that's commonly used for secure

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,640
communications. The security of RSA

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
encryption is based on the premise that

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,039
factoring a large integer number into

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,480
two smaller prime numbers is a very

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,880
difficult computation for [music] a

18
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,640
classical computer to perform. So for

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
example, if you're dissatisfied with

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,320
your current level of security, just

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
double the length of your public key and

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,600
it will become exponentially harder for

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
a classical [music] computer to break

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
that encryption scheme. In contrast,

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
Shor's algorithm can perform the same

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,680
task with only a marginal increase in

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
difficulty as the length of the key is

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
increased.
