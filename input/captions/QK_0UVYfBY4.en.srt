1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,760
In my group, we study and develop

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,440
materials to make nuclear power safer.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,879
If you want to do a neat demo, we can

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,800
actually make some stainless steel from

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,240
scratch and fire up the arc melter. Uh,

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,480
yes, I definitely want to do that.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,000
So, we have a few projects in this lab.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,520
One of them is to produce what I call

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the fuel cladding of the future. At

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,000
Fukushima, the fuel got so hot that it

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
boiled the surrounding water into steam,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
which reacted with the zirconium in the

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
fuel rods. When zirconium reacts with

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
steam, it also makes hydrogen gas. And

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,239
it's the hydrogen gas that exploded.

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
We're developing new combinations of

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
zirconium and stainless steel that don't

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,320
react with steam to make hydrogen. This

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
is a zirconium steam oxidation facility.

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,559
We take different alloys of zirconium

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,120
cut into little pieces, then put them

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,120
through hanging on a bunch of strings in

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,559
this chamber right here, and then send

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,239
in steam at 400° C to simulate what

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,039
would happen in a nuclear reactor in an

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,440
accident condition. For more MIT moments
