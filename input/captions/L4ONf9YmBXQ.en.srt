(David chuckling)

(vibrant music)

27
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,777
Hello, everybody.

28
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:27,974
- [Audience] Hello.

29
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:30,073
- Hello, I'm David Wallace,

30
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:33,450
a mechanical engineering
design professor at MIT.

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,353
So FNAP, facts not assertions, please.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,297
My father once said to me,

33
00:01:40,297 --> 00:01:43,530
"Have a plan and be ready to change it,"

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,380
and that really stuck
with me from an early age.

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,700
The ability to be flexible

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,970
and pivot when something
isn't going the way we planned

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,130
is crucial to the design process

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,680
and really is a skill
that we try to foster

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,230
in each of our design students.

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,810
In our product design class at MIT,

41
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,690
teams explore hundreds of product ideas,

42
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,220
you might say plans,

43
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,690
before deciding which

44
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,200
final single product
direction they'll take.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,750
Next week, you're gonna
be deciding on your

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,740
product direction

47
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,500
for the rest of our product
development process.

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,960
It's about working together

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,770
and really making the best
informed decision that you can.

50
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,390
(students cheering)
(lively music)

51
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,360
Welcome to our Sketch 1 review.

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,810
In this process, every
team member will invest,

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,490
really believe in ideas that
end up on the cutting board.

54
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,510
Each team member will have
plans and then change them.

55
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,550
How do we make these decisions?

56
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,590
This is a hard question,

57
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,820
but FNAP is one thinking
tool that we provide.

58
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,820
So FNAP, what that means is
facts not assertions, please.

59
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,750
And so, a fact is something

60
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,200
that's really a known
or demonstrated truth,

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,260
and an assertion is really
something we believe in

62
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,613
that we can often very convincingly
make sound like a fact.

63
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,064
- [Student] Okay, big yay, yay.

64
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,170
- [David] FNAP really
comes to the forefront

65
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,154
in one key decision making meeting.

66
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:20,880
(upbeat music)

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,890
Up until now, the larger team

68
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,410
has been broken into four sub-teams,

69
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,420
each with their own product idea

70
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,006
that they will be pitching
to the team at large.

71
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,590
(upbeat music continues)

72
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,640
They've poured a lot of
energy, thought and care

73
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,470
into these products,

74
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,163
so they're highly, highly
invested in each of their ideas.

75
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,270
But now they need to come
together to look at the facts

76
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,450
and set aside assertions to
choose the final product idea

77
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,950
that they'll all rally behind

78
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,570
for the final prototype launch.

79
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,157
- [Student] That was a 50/50 split.

80
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:54,824
- [Students] Oh!

81
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:57,510
(upbeat music continues)

82
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,880
- [David] We actually have
signs up in our meeting room

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,410
with giant letters, FNAP, when
teams are making decisions,

84
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,210
- We all remember our FNAP principle,

85
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,129
what does it stand for?

86
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,920
- [Students] Facts not assertions, please.

87
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,930
- And we almost make it like a chant,

88
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,230
perhaps like a game, a dance, a song,

89
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,322
FNAP that you can remember.

90
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:19,260
(students applauding)

91
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,900
Some teams make FNAP hats,

92
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,790
and so when somebody in a meeting

93
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,640
is starting to make
assertions stated as fact,

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,840
they get the hat.

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,890
- I just think there's no way that

96
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,436
this steal would ever bend.

97
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,519
- [Students] Oh! The hat!

98
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:35,470
(upbeat music continues)

99
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,500
- So it provides a really fun

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,366
and kind of tension relieving way

101
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,610
to have this hard discussion of,

102
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,350
okay, what do we really know?

103
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,510
What are the things that we hope we know?

104
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,320
And agree on how to sort
them out to balance the risks

105
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,560
or, you know, the knowns
where we feel like we're safe.

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,060
And you have to take some risks,

107
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,330
but you have to have a kinda
reasonable handle on that

108
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,827
before you commit too much.

109
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:03,840
- We're gonna vote and we're
gonna vote for the one we want.

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,730
Heads down, heads down.

111
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,093
Okay, slimsuit, raise your hand.

112
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,903
Auto sketch, raise your hand.

113
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,753
Okay, here you go.

114
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,570
Chosen slimsuit.

115
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,403
- [Students] Whoo!

116
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:24,630
- [Student] Get everyone's hands.

117
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,235
- [Students] Whoa!

118
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:27,660
(students applauding)

119
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,760
- [David] This year's yellow
team reached a consensus

120
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,703
to move forward with one
of their proposed products,

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,610
but after learning about
a critical shortcoming

122
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,470
related to user needs,

123
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,830
they pivoted to another
of their product ideas.

124
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,750
Then after getting some user feedback,

125
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,010
they pivoted again back to
one of their original ideas,

126
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,690
the fish feeder.

127
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,010
- For testing purposes,

128
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,870
I'm in contact with three fish farms

129
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,543
who have all said that they'd
be willing to help us test.

130
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:56,370
(upbeat music continues)

131
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,592
- It's really easy to go down a path

132
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:02,040
following things that
are asserted beliefs,

133
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,520
rather than facts, and
it can lead to trouble.

134
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,860
And in design teams in our class,

135
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,050
that happens from time to time

136
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,510
and the students eventually realize it

137
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,200
and then after some struggle
become very good at pivoting.

138
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,720
And that's really the lesson of FNAP

139
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
where you've learned
it and internalized it

140
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,570
and you're gonna remember it.

141
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,183
Sometimes, despite our best
laid plans, ideas break.

142
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,243
It happens.

143
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:32,673
It's the cost of doing business
in a messy physical world,

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,140
but in our quest to tame it
and forge a better world,

145
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,450
we must be open, humble,
and confident enough

146
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,643
to recognize when to change course.

147
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,764
Can we all apply the idea
of FNAP to work together

148
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,350
and be more open to change?

149
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,860
To have a plan, but remain
flexible enough to change it

150
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,810
when presented with the facts?

151
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,750
I'll assert, yes, I think we can.

152
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,630
Be on the watch to identify assertions,

153
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,870
diligently search for facts, known truths,

154
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,560
make choices understanding
which information is fact

155
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,420
and which is hope.

156
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,198
Be honest with yourself,
challenge your ideas,

157
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:16,440
have a plan, and be ready to change it.

158
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,229
And as always, keep playing seriously.

159
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:23,146
(electronic music)

160
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:30,382
(upbeat music continues)
