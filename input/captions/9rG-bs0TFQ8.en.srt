1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,480
Last time we start looking at what's

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,480
called the rebound intervals.

3
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,240
So we have for the reman integral we

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,200
have a function uh f that is defined on

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:39,559
some interval from a to b

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,559
into r and this function is bounded

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,120
and then we have a p here is a partition

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,320
uh of this integral

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,879
And so this means that we have a number

10
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,960
of dividing points

11
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:10,799
where uh a is the first

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:15,680
and then we have x1 x0 that is a x1 x2

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:20,000
and so on up to say uh xn and that is

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,400
the uh final point uh endpoint of of the

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,040
interval.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,759
So this is a partition. You know these

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,759
are the dividing points.

18
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,119
Then we look at the length of each of

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:45,439
these sub intervals. So we have the sub

20
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:48,000
interval from x i minus one to x i and

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,560
uh the length of one of these sub

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,520
interval we denote by delta x i and so

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,520
this is x i - x i minus one

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,119
and then we we look at

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,680
right so here if you have the function

26
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,680
here this is the function F.

27
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,520
Uh, and here we have the interval from A

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,840
to B.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,400
And so this here is the first dividing

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,640
point. This is the last dividing point.

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,400
And then we have these other dividing

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,400
points uh in between

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,480
and this maybe extra like that.

34
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,599
Then we look at the function uh on uh

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,910
one of these sub intervals. So we look

36
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,280
at um

37
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,080
[Applause]

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,160
we look at the function and we restrict

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,160
it to one of these sub interval.

40
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,560
Right?

41
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,800
And then remember the function is is

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,319
bounded and so we're looking at it on

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:11,319
one of these and we defined capital mi

44
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,319
to be the soup of f over this sub.

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,360
And we defined likewise we define little

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,360
mi to be the in

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,959
right and this makes sense the finite

48
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,959
number because the function is bounded

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,560
and then we look at the upper and the

50
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,560
lower sum. So the upper

51
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,239
sum

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,239
so the upper sum is that we have this

53
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:50,159
given partition

54
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:52,720
and we look at the sum here of the MI

55
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,400
times delta xi

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,640
and we're summing this is from one to n.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,239
So this is the upper sum of the function

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,439
for this partition. Right? And likewise

59
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,439
we look at the lower sum.

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,519
This is where we sum the infom and we

61
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,040
wait them by the length of the

62
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,600
intervals.

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:28,479
So we look at mi and then delta x i and

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:31,960
i = 1 to n. And this is uh the lower sum

65
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,960
for this partition.

66
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,880
And then just using

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,000
then just using that.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,880
So of course for these MI

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,520
here it's the infant sum on the same

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,199
interval. So little MI is lesser or

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,240
equal to capital MI. Right? But this

72
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,160
also means right that these weights are

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,960
the same. If this here is less than

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:09,560
that, it means that that the lower sum

75
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,560
is lesser equal to the upper sum.

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,759
Now the second thing we looked at is so

77
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,560
so again we looked at again we have this

78
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,560
partition P and we looked at P1 is a

79
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,560
subartition

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,280
subartition or refinement.

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,039
This is if uh if

82
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,680
P1

83
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,680
has the same

84
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,919
dividing point

85
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,360
as P and then presumably some

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,919
then uh then positive I mean then uh

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,919
some more

88
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,639
Right? I mean you could have uh that you

89
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,039
could have that the two partition was

90
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,000
exactly the same and you would still say

91
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,880
that one is a trivial subartetition of

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,639
the other but this is but in general

93
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,840
right a subartetition would have more

94
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,680
dividing points right

95
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,560
and so then the thing is that um if

96
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
you're looking at so let's say that so

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,000
so

98
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,080
that p here again has the partitions.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,080
This is it's a partition that comes from

100
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,080
P

101
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,080
and um and let's say that P1 here

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,919
let me illustrate it as if P1 have one

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:04,479
additional so here you have X0 which is

104
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:09,280
A here you have X in which is B and then

105
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:12,400
you have two others say this is X1 maybe

106
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,599
and this here is X Okay. Then you have

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:21,039
bunch of other this is the partition P

108
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:24,639
and then um then um

109
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,240
um uh P1 let's say have one more

110
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,440
dividing point it could have many more

111
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,000
dividing points but if you're looking at

112
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:38,240
so you have here

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,479
X I minus one and then you have X I and

114
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,880
then maybe uh the the P1 P1 this

115
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,400
partition have an additional dividing

116
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,840
point just called that Y right

117
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,120
well then the contribution that you get

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:08:00,160
from from to the lower and upper sum so

119
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,479
the contribution that you get from this

120
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:08,639
or that for for P you can think about

121
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:12,000
that as MI this is the contribution from

122
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:16,840
the lower sum And here you have the

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,840
contribution from the opposite.

124
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:25,919
But now

125
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:27,840
um now you see that um that for the sub

126
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,039
partition

127
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,719
then you have that so the intervals for

128
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,719
the sub partition this here is the

129
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:40,640
interval for the original partition P

130
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,719
but uh for the sub partition it's this

131
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,480
is now divided into two intervals this

132
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:51,040
here and that here right

133
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:54,240
and so Uh so you have that so this thing

134
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:59,760
here this is in this case is split into

135
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:06,240
two and one of them is y - x i -1 and

136
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:11,519
the other is x i - one right

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,440
now for if you're looking at the say the

138
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,240
lower

139
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,800
sum for this for this sub partition

140
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Right? So this thing here so the

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,680
contribution that you get from this here

142
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,120
well you have now you have two intervals

143
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:35,040
and so you're getting a you're getting a

144
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,920
contribution which is the in

145
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,080
on this thing here on this little

146
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
interval here

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,920
of f

148
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:52,080
times y - x i -1 and then you get a

149
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:59,040
second contribution which is n on this

150
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:05,360
interval here from from uh from y to x i

151
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:08,959
of f and then it's x i - one right so

152
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,480
this is a contribution that you get from

153
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:16,800
this interval here

154
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,519
but this thing here is smaller equal to

155
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,800
the it's actually sorry this here is

156
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,600
larger equal to the in where you take

157
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,800
the in over the larger interval that

158
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,320
goes from this point to that point right

159
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,480
so you have that this is larger than y -

160
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:40,480
x i minus one this thing here is is also

161
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,160
larger than this little m i and then is

162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,079
x i minus y

163
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,640
and now you can just factor out so

164
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,279
you're hitting MI and then when you add

165
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,720
these two together right then you see

166
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,320
that this gives you exactly X I - X I

167
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,800
minus one so this is little MI time

168
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,279
delta X I right so this means that if

169
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,160
you so you see that the contribution

170
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,800
that you get on this little interval for

171
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,959
this is larger than the same

172
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,160
contribution that you get from this

173
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,040
larger equal two, right? And so when

174
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,680
you're summing over all intervals,

175
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:30,600
then you get that if you if P1

176
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,600
is a refinement or subartetition,

177
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:42,120
then this lower here, the lower sum

178
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,120
go up.

179
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,480
So this lower sum go up. And if you do

180
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,519
it now, if you do the same stuff

181
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,440
for the upper sum, then this here would

182
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,200
instead of being in, it would have to be

183
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,279
the soup.

184
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,160
This here would have to be the soup.

185
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,639
But the soup on the smaller interval is

186
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,000
now then the this inequality would

187
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,839
reverse. It's less or equal to and then

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,800
it becomes a soup on the larger

189
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,160
interval. This here remains the same.

190
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,200
This here again becomes a larger one.

191
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,959
So this here becomes

192
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,519
less than this. This here becomes less

193
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,320
than this.

194
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:33,040
And so what you see is that the soup

195
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:36,959
here go down. Right? So the the lower

196
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,279
sum go up. And uh um and if you're

197
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,320
looking at the

198
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:46,560
upper sum

199
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,680
this here decrease.

200
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:54,240
So you have that right. And so putting

201
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,880
this together you have that uh that you

202
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,720
have that the lower sum

203
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:05,120
for for the partition P is less than the

204
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,160
lower sum for this sub partition which

205
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,320
is less than the upper sum for the sub

206
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,160
partition

207
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,120
which is less than the original upper

208
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,639
sum.

209
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,680
Okay. So you have that

210
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,120
and so this is this is like a key key

211
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,519
fact. It's sort of an obvious fact but

212
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
it's a key fact.

213
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,360
Okay.

214
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:39,040
So now so that was

215
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,639
that was the upper and lower sum.

216
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,040
So now we define the

217
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,519
upper and lower

218
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,279
integrals.

219
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,279
So we define the upper

220
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,680
and lower

221
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,320
uh reman integrals.

222
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:14,399
We define them as follow

223
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:18,079
that uh the upper one

224
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,600
we denote like this

225
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,839
and this here is now the in

226
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,440
of all partitions

227
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,440
of the of the upper sum.

228
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,320
And likewise we define the lower reman

229
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,959
integral

230
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,240
of this function this bounded function

231
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,519
to be the soup

232
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,320
of the of the lower

233
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,360
sums like that. So soup of all

234
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,199
partitions. Okay. So that is the upper

235
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,079
and lower sums uh remals.

236
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,120
And so now

237
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,959
we say that the function

238
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,959
this boundless function f is reband

239
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,959
integral.

240
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,079
So f here.

241
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,720
So f

242
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,720
is set to be

243
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,600
a reman integral

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,440
and rewrite uh and rewrite that f here

245
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,279
is like this.

246
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,320
So it means that it's remain integral

247
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,560
uh if if the following is the case. So

248
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,079
if

249
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,079
uh this lower integral here

250
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,480
is equal to the upper integral

251
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:12,000
and if this is the case then we just

252
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:15,000
write and then uh and then the reman

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
integral

254
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,120
uh of of f is then denoted by just like

255
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,120
that.

256
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Okay.

257
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,040
And so so this is so this is uh this is

258
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,000
reman's way of defining integrals. There

259
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:45,000
are other ways uh but this is I think

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
this was the first way where

261
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,399
um where you have a where it's it where

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,959
you have a a definition that really made

263
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:58,639
sense.

264
00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:01,759
Uh okay. So now the first thing I want

265
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:06,000
to observe is

266
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,600
that for a general function you always

267
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,880
have

268
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,880
so in general so

269
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,520
we always have whether the function is

270
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,600
reman integraable or not. We always have

271
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,319
that the lower integral here, the lower

272
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:31,160
reman integral

273
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,160
is lesser equal to the upper.

274
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,760
And so why is that the case? Right? So

275
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,760
this is because

276
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,840
right this is because if you take a a

277
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,840
partition

278
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,840
so fix a partition

279
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,000
uh then you have that

280
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,559
You have that the lower

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
sum here

282
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,559
uh is

283
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:22,520
um is of course less or equal to

284
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,520
uh this thing here

285
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,400
right because this here was was the soup

286
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,520
of all partitions.

287
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,039
So you have that

288
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:39,320
but in fact what you also have that you

289
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,320
but More importantly,

290
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:56,160
uh you have that this L of F here

291
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,760
uh I claim that this is uh lesser equal

292
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,799
to

293
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,799
uh the upper sum.

294
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,799
um

295
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,799
for any

296
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,600
any other any other petition for any

297
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
petition.

298
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,160
So I claim that you always have this

299
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,679
here. If you take two partition P and P

300
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,840
star then the lower sum for one is less

301
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,160
or equal to the upper sum for the other.

302
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,360
Why is that the case? This just uses

303
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,360
that inequality over there.

304
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:46,160
It uses that together with this

305
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:50,039
inequality. So let's see.

306
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,039
So if you take

307
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,120
if you take if P here is a partition

308
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,679
and P star is a partition

309
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,039
then you could take a partition. So, so

310
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,320
let

311
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,320
bar be the partition

312
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,240
that has

313
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,960
all the dividing points

314
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,960
of P and all

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
the dividing points.

316
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:47,120
of P star

317
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,280
right so the dividing point of P bar is

318
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,640
a union of the dividing points of the

319
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,159
two partitions right but it but this

320
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,720
means that P bar here so

321
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:03,760
P bar here is a refinement it's a it's a

322
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,760
refinement of subartetition

323
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,720
of both

324
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,720
uh P and

325
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,400
P star, right? Because it has all of the

326
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,080
dividing points of either, right?

327
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,480
But this means that remember that the

328
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,360
lower sum

329
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,080
so if you're looking at this the lower

330
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,200
sum if you take a subartetition

331
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,840
that goes up right.

332
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,360
So if you take a subartetition the lower

333
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,120
sum will go up

334
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,720
but the lower sum is always lesser equal

335
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,000
to the upper sum for a given partition.

336
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:56,559
Right? But this here is now a refinement

337
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,559
of P star. So the upper sum go down. So

338
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,159
this here is lesser equal to U F of P

339
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,919
star.

340
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,919
Right? And so there you have it that

341
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,640
this thing here the lower sum for one

342
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,000
partition is always smaller than the

343
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,120
upper sum for the other. Right?

344
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,679
And so this means that if you now take a

345
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,000
petition,

346
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,000
so now

347
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,919
so now it means that for for a fixed

348
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,919
partition

349
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,360
P. So we have that this thing here

350
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,080
is less or equal to

351
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,159
this

352
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,440
single about P is being fixed but this

353
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:55,600
is now for all other for all partitions

354
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,960
P star. So this is for all

355
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,720
P star. But if it holds for all this

356
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:06,000
here is a sorry say is lesser equal to

357
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,480
if it holds for all then it also this

358
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,280
inequal this is a fixed number. This

359
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,400
means that this here is a lower bound

360
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,400
for for this family. So this means that

361
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:22,480
L f of P

362
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,960
is less or equal to the in

363
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,960
of those guys,

364
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,320
right? It's less or equal to the in but

365
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,320
that here is just the this here is by

366
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,039
definition

367
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,039
the upper reman sum up reman integral

368
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,039
right

369
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,520
but this means but this is for each so

370
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,280
now you forget about the p star you have

371
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,760
that this thing here is less than that

372
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,200
number so this means that this number

373
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,640
here is an upper bound for this whole

374
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,200
family Okay. So this means that also the

375
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,840
soup the smallest upper bound must be

376
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,840
less than that. Right? So this means

377
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,200
that the soup soup of

378
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,000
of l f of p

379
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,000
must be less or equal to this thing

380
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
here.

381
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,120
But the soup is by definition the lower

382
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,120
integral.

383
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:36,679
Right. So you always have and this is

384
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,679
this this claim over here. Right.

385
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:45,600
Um okay. So, so that's the that's the

386
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:49,200
first let's look at so

387
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,919
let's look at um

388
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,039
let's look at a function

389
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,960
uh that is I I added just a little bit

390
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,799
if if you know if you find it

391
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,799
interesting I find it interesting but

392
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:06,159
maybe you don't but a little bit about

393
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:08,240
reman that's uh he died rather young uh

394
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,400
of tuberculosis

395
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,080
But he had an incredible impact.

396
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,480
He had an incredible I mean this is one

397
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,720
of his contributions. His first

398
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,440
contribution

399
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,279
his he was a student of another really

400
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
famous

401
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,520
uh

402
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,360
mathematician perhaps the most famous of

403
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,760
all time Gaus. Uh and so

404
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,600
uh at those times when you wrote your

405
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,679
thesis

406
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,000
then you had like six months to write

407
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:47,440
your thesis and um

408
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,840
and and you you know sort of formally

409
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,320
you couldn't choose your subject but it

410
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,159
was always you it was always anyway you

411
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,960
always got permission to choose it. So

412
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,559
you had to give three suggestions for

413
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,919
something you would write your thesis

414
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,559
on. And so but it was always it was you

415
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,559
know a sort of unspoken rule that your

416
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,919
advisor always picked number one and

417
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,559
that's what you wanted. And then you

418
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,400
could add some other crazy stuff as two

419
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,480
other suggestions.

420
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,120
But so Reman had you know three

421
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,559
suggestions and the third one uh which

422
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,080
he have absolutely no idea about was um

423
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:29,760
to make sense of uh curvature in higher

424
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,520
dimension and and so he just put it in

425
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,120
there. He knew it wasn't going to be

426
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,520
selected

427
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,240
but actually at the time this was what

428
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,159
Gaus was interested in and so Gaus said

429
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,559
to hell with the rules. I'll pick number

430
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,320
three. And so he had six months and

431
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,200
nobody had figured this out. You know,

432
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,559
Gaus is considered by many the greatest

433
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,279
mathematician of all time. And so but

434
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,039
after six months actually so reman came

435
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,679
up with something called the curvature

436
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,279
tensor which is this object in all

437
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,320
dimension

438
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,279
and that generalized uh Gaus's work and

439
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,279
and this lay the foundation for general

440
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,000
relativity. Yeah. Came you know many

441
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:14,320
years later you know or

442
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,120
uh uh 70 years or so later.

443
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,159
Um so that was the Reman's first. This

444
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,240
is one of Reman's other contributions

445
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,120
and there are other things that was only

446
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,919
published you know long time after his

447
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,039
death that have had tremendous a

448
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,400
tremendous contribution in other areas.

449
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,360
Anyway, so this is so this was Reman's

450
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,570
uh way of defining the intercourse. Uh

451
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,109
let me um

452
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,109
[Applause]

453
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,960
let me um

454
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,919
look at a function. So we talked about

455
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,840
that a little bit but we didn't actually

456
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,840
define it. So so here's an example of a

457
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,159
function that is not reman integraable.

458
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,399
So it's a function defined on the

459
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:11,760
integral from zero to one. same it's

460
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:14,640
bounded and so the function is uh f ofx

461
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,039
is equal to

462
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:24,200
uh one

463
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:24,200
if uh if x here is rational

464
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,360
and it's sure uh otherwise

465
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,440
Okay.

466
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,760
And so of course this function here is

467
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,039
always between zero and one. So it's

468
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,279
it's definitely bounded, right? But if

469
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:50,799
you take now any interval

470
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:55,559
so the so

471
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,559
this here so I claim here

472
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,480
uh uh f here

473
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,720
is not

474
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,720
uh remmanageable.

475
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:22,480
And so the thing is that if you take uh

476
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,760
if you take a

477
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,399
interval like this and you take a sub

478
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,720
partition

479
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,720
like that

480
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,399
uh and now you have that and now you're

481
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,840
looking at one of these

482
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,880
mi. So here you have x i minus one and

483
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,600
here you have x i

484
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,960
and so you're looking at

485
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,720
mi. So this is some little interval like

486
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,399
this. But on any kind of small interval

487
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,320
you know if it's really a proper

488
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,520
integral if it's not just a point but

489
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,840
it's a proper integral interval then

490
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,159
there's always point that are rational

491
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,760
and always point that are not rational.

492
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:13,039
Right? So this means that this here this

493
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:17,120
here the soup here would have to be one

494
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,679
but the in here would be zero

495
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,159
right and so this means that for the

496
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,880
upper so this is just any partition and

497
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,679
so this means that for if you're looking

498
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,799
at the upper sum

499
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:34,720
the upper sum here but it's now the sum

500
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,679
of these capital mi delta xi this here

501
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,000
is one so it's just a sum of the length

502
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,320
of these smaller interval but that's

503
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,279
just one because the whole interval is

504
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,520
from 0 to one and likewise for the lower

505
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:55,440
interval a lower sum this is the sum

506
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:57,840
here of these small mi delta xi

507
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,240
these here are zero so this whole thing

508
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,240
here is zero

509
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:08,320
so you see that if you this is for all

510
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,080
partitions.

511
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,399
So this means that if you take the

512
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,080
infreom of this you still get one and if

513
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,919
you take the soup of these you still get

514
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,960
zero. So so those two numbers are not

515
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,279
the same. The lower and the upper reman

516
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,399
integrals are not the same. So the

517
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,399
function is not reman integral.

518
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,640
So now the next thing is

519
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,760
um right the next thing is so we want to

520
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,600
know which functions are remman

521
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,760
integraable uh and so here's a useful

522
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,760
little criteria

523
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,760
uh so lema

524
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,760
so you have a function again that is

525
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,760
bounded

526
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,960
uh then um then f

527
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,360
is reman integral and again we write it

528
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,360
like this. So it's reman integral if for

529
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
all

530
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,039
epsilon greater than zero uh there exist

531
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,320
a partition

532
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:40,159
p so that the

533
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,159
um so that the uh upper integral

534
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,200
upper sum. Sorry. So that the upper sum

535
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,039
minus the lower sum. Remember that this

536
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:55,360
is always bigger than the lower sum.

537
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,519
If this here is less than epsilon.

538
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,600
Okay. So if we want to check that a

539
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,919
function is remman integraable then we

540
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,399
just need to check that for all epsilon

541
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:09,760
we can find a partition

542
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:12,960
um um uh with this property here. And so

543
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,559
this is a statement that is if and only

544
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,399
if. So I should say if and only if if

545
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,399
and

546
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:24,080
if if

547
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:27,080
and only if

548
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,080
if if.

549
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Okay.

550
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,720
So just try to prove that and then we're

551
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,640
going to use this later on

552
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,039
to

553
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,039
prove that a lot of functions are reman

554
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,039
integral.

555
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,240
So,

556
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,799
so suppose that uh that f. So, if

557
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,799
f here is reman integraable.

558
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,480
So if it is reman integraable then we

559
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,240
know that this

560
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:25,720
lower reman integral

561
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,720
is equal to the upper reman integral.

562
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,879
This here was the soup of all. This here

563
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,119
was the soup of all lower sums for all

564
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,240
over all partitions.

565
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,240
And this here was the in of all upper

566
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,240
sum

567
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,079
like that over all partitions.

568
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,160
And now

569
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,160
um so this means that so therefore

570
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:11,720
given

571
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,720
epsilon greater than zero there exist

572
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,320
a partition

573
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,480
P1

574
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,040
right because this has a super wall

575
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,920
partition So it means that uh there

576
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,920
exist a partition so that this lower

577
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,680
uh lower sum here

578
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
is uh bigger equal to

579
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,000
this here

580
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,640
minus epsilon / two right it's just

581
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,960
because it's a soup over all these

582
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:55,839
numbers so there must exist one that

583
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,839
comes this close to to the soup.

584
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,839
Likewise,

585
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,800
likewise

586
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,920
there exist

587
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,920
Likewise there exist

588
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,839
a partition

589
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,040
P2

590
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,320
sorry this here should be P1 right this

591
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:35,119
is the soup over so so there exist a

592
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:38,400
partition P2 so that the right so that

593
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,720
for that this is one of the one where

594
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,400
this value here is really small so this

595
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:49,720
is not too much larger than this so this

596
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,720
means that this for P2

597
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,640
is um is smaller equal to this here

598
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,240
upper

599
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:05,560
upper remain integral

600
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,560
uh plus epsilon / two.

601
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:17,320
So now we let So now let

602
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,320
be the partition

603
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:27,079
with

604
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,079
uh all the dividing points

605
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,960
uh of both

606
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,440
P1

607
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,160
and P2, right? So it has all of the

608
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,920
writing points on P1 together with all

609
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:51,839
of the biting points on P2 right but now

610
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,200
for this partition we have that well for

611
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,760
this is a refinement of P1

612
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,079
so if it's refinement the value here

613
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,079
goes up

614
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:11,680
and this thing here is so this is less

615
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:15,520
than the upper for the same thing

616
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,800
and since it's a refinement also of P2

617
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,839
we have that it is less than the

618
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,440
opposite for P2

619
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,160
right

620
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:32,000
but now you see that uh this thing here

621
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,839
so uh L right so the difference between

622
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,880
these two the difference between these

623
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,560
two numbers so this is the difference

624
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:44,640
here so u FP

625
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:48,000
minus U F

626
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,960
P sorry LFP

627
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,880
right this difference here this here is

628
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,720
bigger than that so if you take this and

629
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,680
subtract this you're getting something

630
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,920
non- negative and this the spread

631
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,640
between these two smaller than the

632
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:12,560
spread between these right so this is

633
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:16,000
less than Q of F p2 minus L of FP1.

634
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:22,160
Uh but this thing here

635
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:28,400
is this thing here is less than uh u f

636
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:31,359
P2 minus this upper integral here

637
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,119
the the assuming that it's remain

638
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,160
integral. So the upper and lower are the

639
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:41,200
same. So it's so this thing here we can

640
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:43,119
write it as this plus uh minus sorry

641
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,119
um

642
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,040
uh l

643
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,599
uh f

644
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,400
p1 minus

645
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,400
uh the integral here

646
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,640
like that right I'm just you know

647
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,960
subtracting and then adding back the

648
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,760
same thing

649
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,320
And this one here we already found that

650
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,480
this here was bounded by epsilon / two

651
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,320
right this here is remember we're

652
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,680
assuming that it's that is reman

653
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,520
integraable so this here is the same

654
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,720
thing as when you have the upper one

655
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:28,400
right and this thing here is this here

656
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,599
is uh is also bounded by this is

657
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,880
actually right this is this is negative

658
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,400
but it's It's right. So this thing here

659
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,280
is

660
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:45,520
is um is bigger equal to maybe I should

661
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,240
write it as um

662
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,960
well let me write it like this plus uh

663
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:58,880
and then I can write it as the integral

664
00:40:50,960 --> 00:41:02,240
from a to b of fx dx minus l f of p1.

665
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,000
Right? But this thing here was bounded

666
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:10,240
by epsilon / two also. So epsilon / 2

667
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,440
plus epsilon / two. So this is uh equal

668
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,440
to epsilon. Right?

669
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:23,119
So, so again if you want to test that a

670
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,200
function is reman integral you just need

671
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,440
to find for a given for any given

672
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,640
epsilon you need to be able to find a

673
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,400
partition so that the upper sum for that

674
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,319
partition

675
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,119
uh is uh minus the lower sum for the

676
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,119
same partition is less than epsilon.

677
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,119
Okay.

678
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,359
And so now um so now this leads us to

679
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,760
the next theorem. So the next theorem is

680
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:56,760
that any continuous function is rem

681
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,760
integraable.

682
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,000
So any reman sum sorry any continuous

683
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,000
function any

684
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,880
in a continuous function

685
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,119
on

686
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,400
integral like this. This is you know a

687
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:35,480
and b are real numbers

688
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,480
uh is uh reman integral.

689
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,640
Okay, so this is the next theorem that

690
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:50,079
we want to prove. But in order to prove

691
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:54,920
that we need a tool and so this is

692
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,920
what's called uniformly continuous.

693
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,440
So to to show this we need the notion of

694
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,480
being uniformly continuous.

695
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,480
So what is that?

696
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
So,

697
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,319
so in the proof

698
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,280
we need

699
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,160
the notion

700
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,839
of uniformly continuous

701
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:46,240
Okay, so that's the following that you

702
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:51,760
have a function defined on some interval

703
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:55,200
say could be all of R for that matter.

704
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,160
So you have a function like this and f

705
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,680
is set to be

706
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,680
is uh set to be

707
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,720
uniformly continuous.

708
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,640
Uh if if

709
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,599
all

710
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,920
uh epsilon greater than zero,

711
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,920
there exist

712
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:36,400
delta greater than zero such that

713
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:42,680
as long as x and y

714
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,680
are less than delta, then their images

715
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:50,560
is is less than epsilon. Okay.

716
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,000
So what is the difference between this

717
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,560
and continuity? For continuity you

718
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,800
always you you looking at functions

719
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,920
continuous if it's continuous at all

720
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,920
points right and so it's continuous at a

721
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,839
point is so there for to be continuous

722
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,520
at a point is like you're fixing one of

723
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,680
these two. So it's like x is fixed and

724
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,800
then you're looking at if y is

725
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,000
sufficiently close then the value the

726
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,480
difference between the value at x and y

727
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,319
is smaller than epsilon. But here it's

728
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,200
like that the same delta works for all

729
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:32,400
x. You don't have to fix one of the two

730
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,480
points right the same delta work. Okay.

731
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,000
So let's see uh where this is not the

732
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,280
case.

733
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,640
So let me look at two examples.

734
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,599
So just to understand the difference. So

735
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,599
to understand the difference

736
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,440
the difference

737
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,160
between

738
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
continuity

739
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,240
and uniform continuity.

740
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:15,200
Uniform again refer to that that X is

741
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,160
not fixed right or X0 usually we call it

742
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:22,160
X0 and X so one of the two points was

743
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,960
fixed that's the and uniform means that

744
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:31,800
you don't need to fix it's like the same

745
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,800
uh the same delta works for all X0 okay

746
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,760
and so so here is is an example

747
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:46,960
that suppose you take the function f ofx

748
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,880
= to x^2. This is now on on r.

749
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,440
So this function well we already know

750
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:56,000
that this function is continuous right

751
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:59,720
and so if it was uniformly so if f was

752
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,720
uniformly continuous

753
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,079
then

754
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,079
for a given

755
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,880
epsilon greater share there would exist

756
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:23,040
a delta so that the value at X and the

757
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:26,079
value where you say added

758
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,319
uh delta

759
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,599
this difference here

760
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,119
would have to be less than

761
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,520
if you want if you don't like it you

762
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,359
could say delta over two right if you

763
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,440
want it to be strictly the difference

764
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,720
between but but it doesn't really matter

765
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,200
I just say like that this hair would

766
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,440
have to be the case right for and this

767
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,440
hair would have to be the case for all

768
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,440
x.

769
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:59,599
But what is this here? This here is x +

770
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:02,880
delta squared. That's the value of the

771
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:07,520
function in this. And this is the value

772
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,680
of the function in x. Right?

773
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,920
But this thing here just squaring out

774
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:17,920
gives you x^2 + delta squar plus uh 2 x

775
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,040
delta

776
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,680
right and this thing here would have to

777
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,760
be less than epsilon

778
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,200
right?

779
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:33,280
Delta is positive

780
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,440
and so sorry this here minus x²

781
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,440
would have to be less than delta epsilon

782
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,440
right

783
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:45,680
and so you

784
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:48,559
get rid of these two delta is positive

785
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,880
so uh if you have this you would

786
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,000
definitely also have that so this would

787
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,599
implies that or delta actually this

788
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,800
delta square I guess is positive

789
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,040
regardless but you would have that 2x

790
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,839
delta here

791
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:08,240
would have to be less than epsilon right

792
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,480
and delta is now now I'm using the delta

793
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,599
is positive so this here would have to

794
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,599
be the case for all x

795
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,920
but if you just let x be delta is now

796
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,160
supposed to be you know you're supposed

797
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,079
to find some delta so that this here

798
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,440
works for all x so this means that delta

799
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,839
is fixed

800
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,760
But if now delta x becomes incredibly

801
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:33,040
large then of course you don't have this

802
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,240
inequality anymore right so so this

803
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,319
function is not uniform continuous right

804
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,680
yeah

805
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:44,960
>> because it's it only helps us right so I

806
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,760
I I I you know if this here is less than

807
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,000
that this is positive this means that

808
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,760
this here surely is also less than

809
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,920
epsilon

810
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,920
okay so that's one example

811
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,800
Um

812
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,319
the other example

813
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,520
is

814
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:08,240
and and actually let me draw a picture

815
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,680
to just illustrate it.

816
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,160
So if you take so again the function

817
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,000
sort of roughly looks like this. This is

818
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,240
f ofx

819
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,240
= x².

820
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:28,559
This meaning of that it's uniform

821
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:32,800
continuous means that if you take some

822
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:36,160
epsilon right for any given epsilon so

823
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:42,160
if you're looking at a interval over on

824
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:45,119
the y ais here so that this is between

825
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:49,680
you know this here is like a epsilon

826
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:52,720
interval and you're looking at so if you

827
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:56,000
looking at some point here. This here is

828
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:59,839
this point here is taken to to this

829
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,559
here. And now you want to look at some

830
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:04,880
small interval so that you end up in

831
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,559
that interval. Right? And the thing is

832
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,359
that as you're moving further and

833
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,960
further out this the length of that

834
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:13,119
interval would have to be smaller and

835
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,119
smaller, right? But you can't use the

836
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,280
same uniform size, right? So that's why

837
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:22,559
it's not uniformly continuous.

838
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,200
The other example

839
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,680
uh I'm going to look at is where you

840
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,680
take a function.

841
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:39,440
We're taking f ofx equal to 1 /x and x

842
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:41,839
here is now in the interval

843
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,119
from zero to one. One is included but

844
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:49,119
zero is not. Right?

845
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:52,160
And so there the picture is

846
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,960
that this here is the function.

847
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:59,119
And so you see that as you're getting

848
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:02,800
closer here's one and as you're looking

849
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,680
at things closer to zero

850
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,240
then even a really small interval the

851
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,839
functions the value of the function

852
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,319
right would deviate a lot on even a very

853
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,720
small interval right so you couldn't use

854
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:21,920
the same interval size to say that the

855
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,680
value of the function right is smaller

856
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,520
and some epsilon. So ju just make that

857
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:31,040
precise.

858
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:36,640
If you take um a sequence xn equal to 1

859
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:41,640
/ n and y = 1 / 2n

860
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,640
then and you're looking at

861
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:51,520
you're looking at the difference. So if

862
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:53,359
you're looking at xn minus y

863
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,839
right

864
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,280
here you have we don't really need to

865
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:01,440
calculate anything for the first thing

866
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,200
here you have xn here you have y in so

867
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,079
this means that the difference between

868
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:09,440
these two is certainly balanced by this

869
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,200
here so of course you always have you

870
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:15,040
have actually something much better but

871
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,040
this is actually smaller than one /

872
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:24,559
And if you're now looking at the value

873
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,839
of the function, this thing here is 1 /

874
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:31,920
xn. So that's n

875
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:36,720
and uh f of yn

876
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:40,000
is one / 2n. So this is 2 n. So this

877
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:47,359
means that f of xn

878
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:51,680
minus f of yn here this here is equal to

879
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:54,680
this difference here is equal to to 2 n

880
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,680
right

881
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,880
and so you see that you couldn't you

882
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,160
know it's not like it's not for any

883
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,640
given epsilon it doesn't work that if

884
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,880
these two points uh you know there

885
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,160
doesn't exist a delta so that if these

886
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:15,839
two points are delta close then the

887
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,960
images is at most epsilon right

888
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,400
>> I don't know if this is too broad of a

889
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,240
generalization but is that essentially

890
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,680
just the same thing as saying that the

891
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,680
scope is

892
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,079
>> yeah it's it's like that right I mean

893
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:29,359
sort of like that I mean it's not I mean

894
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,960
you know uh uniform continuity doesn't

895
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,720
require

896
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,520
uh I mean sort of like that but not

897
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,960
exactly uh because uniformly uh you So

898
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,559
slope is something about being

899
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,160
differentiable,

900
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,400
right? And and and you can have a

901
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,640
uniformly continuous function that is

902
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,640
not differentiable.

903
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:52,240
Uh but it's it's definitely related.

904
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,240
Yeah.

905
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,880
Um

906
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:00,319
okay. So, so anyway, so uniform again

907
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,839
means that for a given delta for a given

908
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:07,119
epsilon you can use the same delta

909
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:09,040
u for you know at at all points right

910
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,640
otherwise for continuity you were always

911
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,160
fixing one of the points and then you

912
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:17,200
were looking at other points close to

913
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:20,400
that point. Okay.

914
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,760
Okay. So now the the first thing that we

915
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:27,440
want to prove is so we want to prove

916
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,400
that so we want our goal here is to

917
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:34,319
prove this theorem let's say that if you

918
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,640
have a continuous function on a

919
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:40,240
closed interval so closed bounded

920
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,640
interval compact interval from a to b

921
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:47,440
then the function is actually rem

922
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:50,400
integraable okay but uh and and to prove

923
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,960
prove that we need again this notion of

924
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,799
uniformly continuous and so the first

925
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,880
thing we want to prove is we want to

926
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:00,720
upgrade continuity to uniform

927
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,160
continuity.

928
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,720
So what does that mean? So it means that

929
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,400
if you take a function

930
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,920
on a compact interval like this.

931
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,920
So if so if you have a continuous

932
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,920
function

933
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:26,359
then

934
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,359
uh f is uniformly continuous.

935
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,599
Right? So if the interval actually is

936
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,920
compact then the and then a continuous

937
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,559
function is uniformly continuous. Let's

938
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,839
just look at the two examples we had. We

939
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:49,040
had two examples. In the first one f ofx

940
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:51,520
was equal to x^2

941
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,240
but it was defined on all of it was

942
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,880
continuous of course but the thing is it

943
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,520
wasn't on a compact interval. It was on

944
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,240
all of R. In the second this function

945
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,720
here is also continuous

946
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,680
but it's not a compact interval because

947
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,680
zero is not included. Right? Yeah.

948
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,960
>> Compact

949
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,880
is

950
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:19,440
>> compact. So remember that um that so

951
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,760
compact in

952
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,480
that compacts

953
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,040
you can either think about it as as we

954
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:32,079
talk about compact uh metric spaces or

955
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:37,119
compact sets right but for a subsets of

956
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:40,000
um of the real line right compact is the

957
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:44,880
same as saying that it's bounded and

958
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,200
closed Right? And so this in here when I

959
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,520
writing it like this A and B are real

960
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,680
numbers and they are both included.

961
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,480
Right? And again like if it was like

962
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,480
this here then one endpoint is included

963
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,920
but the other one is not. So it's not

964
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:03,359
actually compact. Right?

965
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,520
Okay. And so so if the function here is

966
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,040
continuous then it's uniformly

967
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,000
continuous. So that's what we want to

968
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:13,599
prove right. So, so want to again if the

969
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,799
interval is compact

970
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:19,680
then then actually uh you get the

971
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:24,040
stronger continuity.

972
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,040
So now let's try to prove that

973
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,640
suppose not

974
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,440
if this here was not the case then it

975
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,319
meant that so we take the negation of

976
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,520
the definition of uniform continuity. So

977
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:45,359
this means that there exist a epsilon.

978
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,680
So suppose not then

979
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:48,680
there exist

980
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,599
epsilon greater than zero

981
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,720
such that

982
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,599
such that no delta would work. Right?

983
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:06,480
such that for all

984
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:09,280
delta greater than zero there exist

985
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,280
x comma y.

986
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,280
Um

987
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,119
so that the difference between these two

988
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,480
is less than delta

989
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,480
and the images

990
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,440
is bigger or equal to epsilon. Right?

991
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:33,920
That's just the negation of the

992
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,880
statement. Right?

993
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,760
But now we choose a sequence of delta.

994
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,079
Right? And so we we do this. So this is

995
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,280
for all delta. So really if we take

996
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:48,160
advantage of that we look at at a

997
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:51,119
sequence of of such delta.

998
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:57,319
So so we look at a sequence of such

999
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:57,319
delta and this is where so we use this

1000
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:08,000
for delta equal to 1 / n. Right? So n

1001
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:12,160
here is again a positive

1002
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:16,240
it's a natural number like that.

1003
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:21,119
So this means that we for each n you

1004
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:24,960
have x n and you have yn

1005
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:29,200
they're both in the interval from a to b

1006
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:33,119
and you have that xn minus yn

1007
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:39,839
is less than 1 / n and you have that the

1008
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:42,400
images f of xn minus f of yn

1009
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:47,319
is bigger equal to epsilon, right?

1010
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,319
Epsilon was positive should be positive.

1011
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,920
But this means so now we have xn so the

1012
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,559
these are in this interval. So this

1013
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,440
means that we can find a subsequence by

1014
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:03,280
compactness right we can find

1015
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:06,960
of the balsano vio theorem we have a

1016
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:10,160
subsequence that converts to some x

1017
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:14,400
right this is just a subsequence of

1018
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,400
these x ends right but now you can just

1019
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,839
look at

1020
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:22,319
so now if you're looking at the

1021
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:29,119
corresponding subsequence of the y ends

1022
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:32,319
so you have that y in k - x

1023
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:34,720
this thing here is less or equal to by

1024
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:42,160
the triangle inequality this is less

1025
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:43,839
than equal to y n k - x n k

1026
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:50,119
plus

1027
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:50,119
x n k - x right

1028
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:57,680
and we have that this thing here. This

1029
01:01:52,880 --> 01:02:01,359
here was less than 1 / n and we have

1030
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:03,920
plus this here.

1031
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:07,680
But this thing here is actually over n k

1032
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,839
sorry n k right

1033
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,280
and you have but you have that this

1034
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:16,240
thing here this here this subsequence go

1035
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:19,280
to x. So this here goes to zero and this

1036
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:22,400
here goes to zero. So this means that

1037
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:28,640
these yn

1038
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:32,000
k actually also converts to x right.

1039
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:37,200
So you have but now you have so you have

1040
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:41,680
this and you have the y n k converts to

1041
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:45,200
x. So now this here together with that

1042
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,960
the function is continuous means that

1043
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,960
fxn

1044
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,960
k

1045
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:59,440
converge to f ofx

1046
01:02:52,720 --> 01:03:01,680
and you have that f yn k converts to

1047
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:07,440
also f ofx.

1048
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:11,000
Right? This is just because uh since

1049
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,000
f is continuous

1050
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:22,000
but now you just look at

1051
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:26,400
now you just look at the

1052
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:31,359
right. So now you have that. So again fx

1053
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:35,079
n k converts to uh f ofx

1054
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:35,079
and this here

1055
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:45,920
converts to f ofx. But I claim that this

1056
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:52,240
here but we also have that fx n k minus

1057
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:55,920
f y n k we have that this thing here is

1058
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:58,640
bigger equal to epsilon right

1059
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,799
but then you can't have if this here you

1060
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,640
this here is clearly a contradiction

1061
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:05,039
right because if this here converts to

1062
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,440
that this converts to the same thing

1063
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,520
then these two things here much gets

1064
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,720
closer and closer together, right? But

1065
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,599
they're saying that there are some

1066
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,400
fixing apart, right? So that's clearly a

1067
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:19,280
contradiction.

1068
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:24,920
So this prove that if it is continuous,

1069
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,920
it's also uniformly continuous. Okay.

1070
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:32,480
So now let's use this to prove um to

1071
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,720
prove that if you take a function. So

1072
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,960
now we are ready to get back to the

1073
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,960
zero. That was like our main interest.

1074
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,079
But so you see also like in the two

1075
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:46,799
example I had it was no accident again

1076
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,280
that in the first one the interval was

1077
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:51,760
unbounded. In the second one the

1078
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,160
interval was bounded but it was not

1079
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,400
closed. Right? And so either case it

1080
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,160
failed to be compact. And that was why

1081
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,000
you could have a continuous function

1082
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:05,520
that wasn't uniformly continuous.

1083
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,799
And so now we get back to this theorem.

1084
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:11,200
And so the theorem again is theorem give

1085
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:15,200
you this nice criteria for when a

1086
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:19,480
function is remman integraable. So if

1087
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,480
uh f here is continuous

1088
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:28,280
then uh then f here is rem integraable

1089
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:36,319
and again this here should be it's

1090
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:40,079
understood that it's it's f f

1091
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:41,680
is defined on an interval like this

1092
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,680
interval.

1093
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,680
Okay.

1094
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,920
And so now the proof is like this.

1095
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:59,160
We showed earlier

1096
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:59,160
we showed

1097
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,599
earlier

1098
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,880
that

1099
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,880
we only we that we need

1100
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,839
need only show

1101
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,079
that's uh given

1102
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:27,720
epsilon greater zero. There exist a

1103
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,720
partition

1104
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:37,359
so that if the uh such that the upper

1105
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:40,400
sum

1106
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:42,640
minus the lower sum

1107
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,640
for this partition

1108
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,599
is less than epsilon. Right? That's all

1109
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,960
we need. We need to prove that for each

1110
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:53,680
epsilon there exist a partition so that

1111
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,960
the upper and the lower sum are within

1112
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,960
epson of each other. Okay.

1113
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,960
Now

1114
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:09,640
uh so now you use the so now using that

1115
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:18,480
so so so now so given

1116
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,480
given epsilon greater than zero

1117
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,480
since

1118
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:27,280
f is uniformly continuous

1119
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,839
right so actually proving that if it is

1120
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:34,119
continuous on this compact interval,

1121
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:34,119
it's also uniformly continuous.

1122
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:44,440
Since uh f is uniformly continuous, it

1123
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,440
means that there exist

1124
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:51,640
delta greater zero such that

1125
01:07:55,359 --> 01:08:05,200
if uh x - y is less than delta

1126
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,280
then uh let's say delta is let's say

1127
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:13,119
less than true delta.

1128
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:16,400
Then uh then

1129
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:21,920
then the images

1130
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:26,080
then uh f ofx minus f of y

1131
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:29,600
is now uh smaller than

1132
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,520
uh and then instead of epsilon I using

1133
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,000
epsilon divided by the length of the

1134
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,640
interval sorry and this would be

1135
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,640
strictly less.

1136
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,640
Okay.

1137
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:48,759
So now we let

1138
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,759
let P here be a partition

1139
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,960
where

1140
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,960
each

1141
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:07,440
delta XI each little interval here

1142
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:10,159
uh is is equal to delta Right?

1143
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,480
You just have to be be say less or equal

1144
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:15,480
to delta but you can make it equal to

1145
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,480
delta.

1146
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,359
So now if this is the case, but then we

1147
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:27,199
have

1148
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:31,000
So now if we're looking at one of these

1149
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:31,000
smaller intervals here.

1150
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,759
So now if you're looking at one of these

1151
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:46,080
smaller interval here, here you have x i

1152
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:48,799
minus one and here you have x i. So if

1153
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,719
you're now looking at one of these small

1154
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:56,719
interval then you have that the function

1155
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:59,600
is continuous here. So the

1156
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:05,080
if you're looking at the soup of this

1157
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,080
interval. So the soup on this interval

1158
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:13,040
this is the soup of one of these

1159
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:15,520
intervals here of f the soup here. This

1160
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,920
is it's it's actually achieved by by the

1161
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,159
extreme value theorem. This is achieved

1162
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:27,679
at some point

1163
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:33,600
if say uh y uh y a y and maybe that's

1164
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:37,760
bad my uh so let's just say y right

1165
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:40,880
and likewise on this little interval

1166
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:44,520
the in here

1167
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,520
is also achieved

1168
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,880
and let's call at Y star.

1169
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:55,040
So the infreum is also achieved and

1170
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,480
that's

1171
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,960
achieved at some Y star.

1172
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:05,719
But now this interval here have length

1173
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,719
this here is at most

1174
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,800
at most delta right. So this means that

1175
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:15,840
the difference in the value of any such

1176
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,320
two points right so they are actually

1177
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:21,760
less strictly less than two. So it means

1178
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:25,840
that the value differ at most like this.

1179
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:28,640
So this means that so it means that f of

1180
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,159
y which is actually the soup. So this

1181
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,239
here

1182
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:33,840
so since it's a soup I don't even need

1183
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,440
this here is larger than that. So I

1184
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,360
don't need to even take absolute value

1185
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:40,800
sign on it. But it means that the

1186
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:46,120
difference here is now less than um

1187
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,120
epsilon over b minus a

1188
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:52,560
right

1189
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:57,520
and so this here again is is m of i

1190
01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:00,239
minus m of i like that right

1191
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:02,320
and so now you see that so now let's

1192
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,880
look at the contribution so for the

1193
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,880
upper sum

1194
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:15,440
We have that this here is these capital

1195
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:17,440
mi and then delta xi. For the lower sum,

1196
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:21,360
we have that this is the sum of the

1197
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:24,000
small mi delta xi.

1198
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,880
Right? And so now let's look at the

1199
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,960
difference between these two.

1200
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,920
Right? That's the one we need to prove

1201
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:35,280
is strictly less than epsilon. So if

1202
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:41,920
you're looking at this u

1203
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:46,480
f of p minus l f p this here is now the

1204
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:48,640
sum here and then it's so you're summing

1205
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,360
this thing is the same so you can write

1206
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,920
the sum here the difference well let's

1207
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,679
maybe just write it first write it out

1208
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,920
like this

1209
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:01,120
but then now I can once I have written

1210
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:05,199
it out like this see that I can Write

1211
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,760
this in here as a sum of capital mi

1212
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:10,159
minus little mi

1213
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,560
time delta xi.

1214
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:15,600
Right?

1215
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,600
And this thing here I already figured I

1216
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,920
already have a bound that this is each

1217
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,080
of these is less than this. So I just

1218
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:26,159
write in that bound. So this here is

1219
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:30,960
less than uh and then the sum here

1220
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:33,040
epsilon over b minus a. and then uh like

1221
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,199
this.

1222
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,960
But now this is just a constant. So this

1223
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:40,520
just I can just take this out of the

1224
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,520
summation sign.

1225
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,239
And so I get this thing. So this is the

1226
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,159
sum of the small interval but the sum of

1227
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:53,040
the small interval is the whole

1228
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:55,120
interval. So this is epsilon b minus a *

1229
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,920
b minus a.

1230
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:01,679
And so this is epsilon.

1231
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:04,719
And so you have exactly it's a this

1232
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:10,400
difference here is strictly bounded by

1233
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:13,120
epsilon. Okay. So this proved that that

1234
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:16,560
if the function is continuous

1235
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:20,080
then it is on a compact interval then it

1236
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:23,199
is uh reman integral. And now let me at

1237
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:28,280
least state some of the basic formulas

1238
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:28,280
uh for uh reman integrals.

1239
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:35,960
Um, and so maybe we might prove some of

1240
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,960
these next time.

1241
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:52,199
So the first one is that if you take so

1242
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,199
have this theorem here.

1243
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:58,480
Uh the first one is supposed to take a

1244
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:01,760
function that is remman integraable on

1245
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:06,080
some integral like this

1246
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:10,800
and c here is constant is a real number

1247
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:15,400
then uh then the uh this constant times

1248
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,400
f is also man integraable

1249
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:23,480
and the integral of this function here

1250
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,280
is equal to C * the integral reman

1251
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:33,120
integral like that. Right? So that's the

1252
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,800
first one.

1253
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,199
Uh

1254
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,199
uh the next one is that if you take two

1255
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,199
functions

1256
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:49,239
f and g

1257
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:49,239
suppose you take two functions

1258
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:56,199
uh f and g that are reman integral

1259
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:05,199
uh and uh now let's look at the function

1260
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:08,000
that is the sum of these two. Right? So

1261
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:13,159
this is a new function and the claim is

1262
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,159
that this here is also remain integral

1263
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:20,120
and the integral of the sum

1264
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,960
is the sum of the integrals. Oops.

1265
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:44,239
Okay, that's the second one.

1266
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:47,679
Uh and the third one is that um so the

1267
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:51,040
third one is that if you take if you

1268
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:55,800
take a function two functions

1269
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,800
again they are both reman integraable

1270
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:05,360
uh and you have that f here is lesser

1271
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:08,400
equal to g then the reman integral of f

1272
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:11,400
is lesser equal to the reman integral of

1273
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,400
G

1274
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,640
like that.

1275
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,280
And the f fourth rule

1276
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,880
is that

1277
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:26,159
uh the fourth rule is a little bit

1278
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:30,840
different. So this is

1279
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:30,840
this is if you split the interval.

1280
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:37,280
So the fourth one

1281
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:39,440
is like this. Again I will prove some of

1282
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:42,400
them not all of them but I'll prove some

1283
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:45,360
of them uh next time but not all of them

1284
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,800
I won't prove the first one for sure. So

1285
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:51,360
the fourth is that if you take so

1286
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,600
imagine so you have this interval here

1287
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:57,199
from a to b

1288
01:17:53,600 --> 01:18:00,000
but imagine that so here you have a here

1289
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:02,560
you have b imag imagine that c is

1290
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,640
somewhere in between

1291
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,360
uh a and b

1292
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:12,960
and suppose that you have a function

1293
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:16,560
that is remman integral on this interval

1294
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:18,719
then the claim is That's that then if

1295
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:22,320
you take the function and you restrict

1296
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:24,560
it to either of the either this interval

1297
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,560
or that interval, it's still remand

1298
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,560
integral

1299
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:39,800
and f here is also

1300
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,800
in uh from C to B

1301
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:45,280
and and the claim is that the reman

1302
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,400
integral

1303
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:52,040
on the original integral is the sum of

1304
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,040
the reman integral.

1305
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,679
Okay, like that. Okay. And so if you

1306
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:04,080
think about it in terms of kind of area

1307
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,560
below the graph, right? If you take a

1308
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:08,880
function like this,

1309
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:13,760
if you if this here was if this here was

1310
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:15,679
C, then the area below the graph here,

1311
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,280
I guess this here would be sign area

1312
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,440
below the graph. But if you just took

1313
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,679
the area below, if the function was

1314
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,640
actually positive and you think about

1315
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:27,280
the reman integral as the area below the

1316
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:32,000
graph, if this here is C, this here is

1317
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:35,360
A, this here is B, then this area here

1318
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,679
plus this area is the sum of these two

1319
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:42,159
is the sum underneath the the whole

1320
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:46,920
graph, right? So it makes sense.

1321
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:46,920
Okay, any questions?

1322
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:51,400
Okay, great. See you next time.
