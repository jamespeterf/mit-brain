00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,720
let me just do an example inspired by

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,080
Steph Curry's performance I looked up

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,440
his 3o field goal percentage he makes

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,080
44% of them let's assume that every

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,000
three-point shot he has the same

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,119
probability of making it what's the

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,119
probability that he misses the next

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,720
three shots and then makes the three

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:28,119
after that would it be 56 Cub time 44

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,000
Cub exactly 56 cubed * 44 cubed and how

11
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,559
did we get to that well these are

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,160
independent events so to get the

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,160
probability of the intersection between

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,719
the event that he misses misses misses

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,719
then makes makes makes we just take the

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,440
sum of the probabilities of each of

17
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,640
those events or

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,920
015 now what's the probability of any

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,320
particular sequence of three misses and

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,960
three shots made right and you your

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,280
answer would have been exactly the same

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,760
