1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,400
Well, welcome to the final session here

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,000
um today and I hope you've enjoyed it so

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,279
far. This is going to be the highlight

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,359
because we're going to be hearing from

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
from eight different students. But the

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,760
the motivation for this, we're going to

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,439
call this Pico Talks um came from um a

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,519
question that people ask us. So, my name

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,519
is York Shivine. I'm the associate

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,520
director for fab.no together with an

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,000
arrhof associate director for

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,079
characterization. We're going to be the

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,399
chairs of this next session. And often

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,960
people come to us and ask what do people

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,960
do at MIT nano and and this is actually

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
a very difficult question. It's a

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,600
difficult question because we have 1500

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
users. So in principle I have to give

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:57,039
you 1500 answers. Um and of course 21%

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,520
of all MIT faculty use MIT Nano. So I'd

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,199
have to describe a large chunk of MIT

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,199
and more than 50 different department

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,360
labs and centers come through the

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,600
building in one form or another. Right?

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,760
So it's really really difficult to pin

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
that down into one particular thing. And

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
so what we're going to try to do instead

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,080
is to combine that give you a glimpse of

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
eight different areas that we found

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,159
found interesting and then hopefully in

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,600
doing so show you some curious

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,200
commonalities that you may find

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,119
throughout these talks of different

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,119
research areas that are completely

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,920
unrelated yet have a lot of things in

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,520
common like scaling up quantum effects

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,640
all kinds of things nano. So hopefully

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
you'll enjoy that.

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,400
Um I'll just add a few things. Uh nano

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,320
is about people. Uh it's not about tools

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,399
right and here we are showing you a very

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,399
diverse group of people in terms of

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
their interests and their research but

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
as you will see there are no boundaries

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
between their talks on the pico scales.

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,280
There are not really boundaries because

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,079
you cannot see them right all the

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
boundaries are are on the pico scale. So

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,680
um we will see the flow from one to

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
another and you will see like your said

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
the commonalities of a scale up and

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
commonalities of a quantum and

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,479
commonalities of mechanical testing that

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
go from one technology to another and

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
together we kind of going to transition

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,599
all of this and make a better world. I

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,480
think this is uh aligns with our

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,720
mission. So I will call.

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
>> Okay. So uh hello everyone. Uh my name

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,400
is Yanja and I'm currently a postto

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,480
working with professor Jiz Dalamo group

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
and uh our group's name is extreme

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,720
transistor research group. So I'm going

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to show you how we can build one of the

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,000
most extremely skilled transistors in

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,120
the world um right atano.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,120
So transistors are

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
oh

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,280
It's okay. Okay. Oh, so transi trans

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,800
transistors are the smallest building

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,519
blocks of uh modern microronic chips.

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
And so if you talk about microronics, we

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
can see it in our data life and it's

74
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,959
really ubiquitous. And I'm just showing

75
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,040
you on the left eight examples.

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,879
And probably one of the most popular

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,120
example nowadays is this AI hardwares as

78
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,519
I'm showing here. And in fact this is a

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
figure generated by AI and I really took

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
took me a lot of time to to train. I

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,879
like to let it generate in this fancy

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,200
way. But anyway um and uh these AI

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,840
models are really powered by these

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,760
microchips and these chips are inside

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
all these mainframes and in the clock

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,959
cloud. And these are the magics that we

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,840
can really get to the AI and already we

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,319
we have seen the superpowers of AI and

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,319
it is cool but it comes at a cost which

90
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,599
is the energy.

91
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,080
In fact about uh four years ago at 2020

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,120
people have been aware of how much

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,760
energy the AI could burn to support that

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,280
explosive growth. And just after four

95
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
years at 2024, a few uh maybe last year,

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,319
major tech companies have already turned

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,560
to these small nuclear uh module

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,720
reactors to power their data centers.

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,439
And apparently this is not a sustainable

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,599
trend. So how to solve this? Well, we

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,639
really have to go down to the bottom and

102
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,759
to see if we can get extremely energy

103
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,680
efficient microronic systems. And so

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,919
that's where our research comes in. But

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,199
in fact people have been trying to do

106
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,120
that for the uh micronics in the past 55

107
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
years and that can be seen from this

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
moral scaling in which I'm showing you

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,639
here that the number of transistors on a

110
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,639
microchip is doubling every two years or

111
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,600
um in microchip u microprocessor

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,320
including this microprocessors and GPUs.

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
So the size of these microchips are not

114
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
getting larger and larger. So the only

115
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,080
way to make this happen is to make

116
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
transistor footprint smaller and smaller

117
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,240
and in that way you can get much better

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,240
energy efficiency um as as well as um

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,160
higher performance.

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,880
So I will not go into too much details

121
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,440
here but that really comes to how we can

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,800
make this transistor smaller and that is

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,800
uh what we are uh researching about and

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,759
the the first um invention of the

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
transistor was in this planner structure

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
um in which you have this source gate

127
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
and drain terminals and so you can use

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,880
the gate to control the electron flowing

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,919
from the source to drain or so you can

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,680
turn on or turn off that electron flow

131
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,759
and there is a already a key design

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,840
parameter the gate lines. I will talk

133
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,759
about that later. Um and in about 2012,

134
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,840
people realized that well these

135
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,600
transistors are no longer able to

136
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,240
support further performance improvement

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
or energy efficiency improvement. So we

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,080
have to turn to three-dimensional

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,919
transistors. And as I'm showing on the

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
right, this is the so-called

141
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,919
three-dimensional fin field fuel

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,960
transistors or finite. uh you see this

143
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,520
silicon uh sheet is extruding out of the

144
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,440
planner substrate and then the gate is

145
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
wrapping around uh the channel. So in

146
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,280
that way you can get better performance

147
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,080
and also better energy efficiency. But

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,160
again this electrons still flowing from

149
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,000
the source to drain in the planner

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,039
direction.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,560
And uh so if you look at the evolution

152
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,039
of these fins from this 22nometer node

153
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
when Intel first uh introduced this in

154
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,800
the manufacturing all the way to this 10

155
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,080
nometer node which is the state of art

156
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,400
for fin fats the evolution shows us that

157
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,240
the fins are getting higher higher and

158
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,880
higher also the weights of the fins are

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,520
getting smaller. So the cowars you can

160
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,720
see here I'm labeling the the weights at

161
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,960
the half height of the fins is about

162
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,120
seven nanometer and the height of the

163
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,800
fins is about 53 nanometer. So that

164
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,039
gives you a aspect ratio of 7.5

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,960
and uh there is also fundamental

166
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,280
limitations in how much you can scale

167
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,000
the gate lens. So um from uh many uh

168
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,080
physical barriers the minimum scale is

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
about 20 nometer below which these

170
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,000
transistors are no longer functional

171
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,400
anymore.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
So how can we even get to smaller and

173
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
small transistors if we have some

174
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,639
fundamental limitations on one of the

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,599
directions right and our solution is

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,120
that we instead of flowing the electrons

177
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,960
in the horizontal direction we can

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,039
really flowing these electrons in the

179
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,520
vertical direction and in that way we

180
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,360
can minimize the footprint while still

181
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,599
we can have controllable device parame

182
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,759
uh device performance

183
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,080
and so in the right uh sorry in the

184
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,639
middle I'm showing you probably the most

185
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,479
uh skilled threedimensional transistor

186
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,360
till date. Um, and so it features these

187
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,240
6 nanometer diameter vertical nanowires

188
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,960
at a half height with 135 nanometer

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,440
height. So that gives you more than 20

190
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,759
aspect ratio which is quite impressive.

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,599
And we also introduced a new physical

192
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,520
magnum that I will not go into details

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,400
and it is basically the quantum

194
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,039
mechanical tunneling um between these uh

195
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,280
two material interface. And so in that

196
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,000
way you can further boost the

197
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,919
performance and as I showed as I

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,919
mentioned before um these transistors

199
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,479
are electrically controlled switches. So

200
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,039
that means you can use the gate voltage

201
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,960
to control the flow of the current. And

202
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,639
so this uh on on the right figure I'm

203
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,680
showing you that if we compare the um

204
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,080
the so-called transfer curves um of our

205
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,879
transistors to the state of the art 10

206
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,479
nanometer node from Intel then we see at

207
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,640
just.3 volt VGS or supply voltage which

208
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,919
is quite small compared to the nowadays

209
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,560
uh 7 volt uh supply voltage we get over

210
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,440
30% performance boost and uh so that

211
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,880
shows you it is a promising technology

212
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
although there are a lot of

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,600
manufacturing challenges and so it is

214
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,920
still not yet the the on the road map

215
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,200
but we hope that we provide a new

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,320
solution. Um so looking ahead for the

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,800
future uh in our opinion the

218
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
threedimensional transistors is a very

219
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,519
important building block and still we

220
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,519
need to sky stack multiple layers of

221
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,279
functional devices right on top of each

222
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,160
other in a monolithic 3D integration way

223
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,600
and so we call this 3D transistors into

224
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,800
3D system scheme and we think this will

225
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,880
give us much more energy efficiency and

226
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,200
so we can solve this energy consumption

227
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
problem and can power more AI

228
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,680
development in the future. And with

229
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,519
that, I'd like to acknowledge uh my

230
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,560

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
And by the way, we'll take questions at

241
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,920
the end. You can also type them online,

242
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,279
but we have a microphone at the end. So,

243
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,279
we'll go to the next uh next speaker.

244
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
>> All right. Thank you, York. Um, I'm

245
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
Karen Young. I'm a fourth year PhD

246
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
student here in the electrical

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,440
engineering department at MIT and I'll

248
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,399
be discussing a little bit about the

249
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,360
future of solar specifically how do we

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,640
go from this which is a you know 1 in x

251
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,519
1 in device level solar cell to this

252
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,680
flexible 4 in x 4 in module um and

253
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,959
thinking about why we're even going the

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,760
route of flexible lightweight solutions

255
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,480
so I guess the case for lightweight here

256
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,640
um we think that lightweight really is

257
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,760
the future of solar because we have this

258
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,240
huge dichotomy between what is required

259
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,640
to completely power the entirety of

260
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,880
America's energy needs and what is

261
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,760
actually being produced by solar in

262
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,240
America. Um so essentially all you need

263
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,160
is a solar array about the size of Lake

264
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,640
Michigan and you can completely power

265
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,600
all of America's energy needs. But we're

266
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,920
only using about 10% of the uh total

267
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,920
electricity generated is from solar. Uh

268
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,760
so technologically what can we do about

269
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,079
that? Well, we in envision a network of

270
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,320
distributed solar arrays which place the

271
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,920
power of solar installation into the

272
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
hands of individual homeowners and

273
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,519
businesses. Um, so this allows us to

274
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,000
open up a lot more uh markets where

275
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,720
traditional solar cannot be deployed in.

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,440
Uh, so currently a lot of the solar

277
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,760
insulation in America takes the form of

278
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,640
utility scale solar. So essentially, you

279
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,800
have these huge insolar insulations, you

280
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,040
know, out in remote areas, you know, in

281
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,040
very sunny areas, Nevada, New Mexico, as

282
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,200
well as out in like farms in Illinois

283
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,600
and stuff. Um, and then you pipe all of

284
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,000
that electricity from the source all the

285
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,760
way to your house or to a, you know,

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
commercial business, you'll have

287
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,560
transmission losses along that line, and

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,079
that really limits the amount of areas

289
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,639
you can uh electrify with solar. Um

290
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,440
however, if we completely rein uh

291
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,200
reimagine how solar deployment looks

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,519
like, we can imagine um we can put down

293
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
a solar panel on top of your own house,

294
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,120
on top of your own roof, on top of a

295
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,040
commercial business's roof, and that

296
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,000
really expands the amount of places we

297
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,680
are able to deploy solar in. So, how do

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,440
we do that? Well, right now, 99% of the

299
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,839
solar panels that you see out there is

300
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
made out of silicon. Um, and that's

301
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,839
because it's, you know, quite efficient,

302
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,519
high stability, and also it's a very

303
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,079
wellestablished technology. It's been

304
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,600
around for, you know, 50, 60 years. We

305
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,360
know how to make these things. We know

306
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,680
how to manufacture them, and we know

307
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,720
where to put these. However, because

308
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,399
silicon is so fragile, you need a

309
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,560
sandwich in between two quite thick

310
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,160
pieces of glass, and that makes it quite

311
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,000
heavy. Um so you are unable to mount it

312
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,079
on low loadbearing rooftops such as

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,279
older residential homes, commercial

314
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,440
warehouses, uh commercial factories and

315
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,680
also these are completely you know

316
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,680
useless for disaster relief as well as

317
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,040
access to remote areas such as remote

318
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,200
villages. Uh so how do we rethink solar?

319
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,440
Well, in comes perovskite which is the

320
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,800
area of research that I work on. Um we

321
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,320
can see here that you know they're

322
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,360
pretty high efficiency. We've gotten

323
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,760
them up to about where silicon is at. Um

324
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,760
they're pretty they're pretty stable.

325
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,639
You know, the record-breaking is about

326
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,000
T80 80% of its initial efficiency for

327
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,920
about 9 9,000 hours. Um more

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,320
importantly, however, you can

329
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,480
manufacture these things really simply.

330
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,639
Um they don't rely on a silicon supply

331
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
chain. So you're not relying on, you

332
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
know, silicon wafers coming in from

333
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,279
China. You can completely manufacture

334
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,480
these things inhouse. Um so that really

335
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,160
um is really powerful for indep for your

336
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,160
own independent supply chain and kind of

337
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,360
deconvoluting your process from

338
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,240
geopolitical factors. Most interestingly

339
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,560
to me um you can coat these things

340
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,800
because they are solution processible

341
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,120
onto pretty much any substrate you want

342
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,560
including plastic which is the substrate

343
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
of choice that we'll be discussing

344
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,720
today. Um and that makes it a really

345
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,959
good solution for thin lightweight

346
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,600
flexible solutions.

347
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,480
So we want to do go with perovskites. Um

348
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,160
and how do we do that? Well um we use

349
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
something called slot deck coding. So

350
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,680
all of those really nice, you know, 26

351
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,680
27% high stability, high efficiency. All

352
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
of those devices are made with spin

353
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
coating. So it's the same spin coating

354
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
that you would use to spin on photo

355
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,959
resist um before you know development

356
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,880
and etching. Um, essentially how that

357
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,279
works is you have your substrate on a

358
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,279
chuck, the chuck spins, it makes a very

359
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,600
nice uniform film. Very nice for making

360
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,760
these high efficiency devices. Not so

361
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,160
scalable. So, how do we scale these? We

362
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,399
use something called slot decoding. Um,

363
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,800
and this is the slot decoder that you'll

364
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,680
find inside of the nanomat area inside

365
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,519
of Fab. Nano. It's enclosed within these

366
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,600
two glove boxes which are continuously

367
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,600
purged with compressed dry air. So, you

368
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
can get it down to about 2 3% very

369
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,240
controllable. Um, and then the actual

370
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,399
slot decoder is this thing right here.

371
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,320
Um, so how it works, I have a video of

372
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,320
an actual film being produced over

373
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,399
there. Um, but essentially how it works,

374
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,959
you have this syringe pump. It's pumping

375
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,040
solution through this I'll stand on this

376
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,079
side. Um, it's pumping solution through

377
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,000
this tube into this dye thing. And then

378
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,440
as the bed is moving, your solution is

379
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,320
coming out and that's what's creating

380
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,720
this film. So hopefully my video works.

381
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,199
There it goes. Okay. So we saw the dye

382
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,519
come down. The solution is getting piped

383
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,839
into the dye. It's flowing out of the

384
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,079
dye, creating this little thing right

385
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,759
here called a meniscus. And then you see

386
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,399
the bed move. And you see this nice

387
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,880
little yellow film here.

388
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,320
Uh so that's really good for making thin

389
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,920
films down to you know 10 20 nmters. Um

390
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
so

391
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,720
some struggles however of this it's not

392
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,720
you know as cut and dry as I explained

393
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,000
it to be on the previous slide. Uh so

394
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,759
first of all you need to make a

395
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,920
goodlooking film. So you need to make a

396
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,800
film that has doesn't have pin holes.

397
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,680
It's um defect free. Uh so a little bit

398
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,199
about the idea behind slot decoding. We

399
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,199
have this figure right here. On the

400
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,680
x-axis we have how fast the bed is

401
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,519
moving. On the y ais we have how much

402
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,279
solution you're pumping through the die.

403
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,360
And you want to be in this red area

404
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,680
right here. Um and we can see when we're

405
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,920
in this red area, you have a nice smooth

406
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,560
coating. However, if you step out of

407
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,240
this area, you can have uh some of these

408
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,199
examples are some of the defects that

409
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,040
you can experience. Um, but these

410
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,040
defects aren't always apparent in the

411
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,199
end film. So, how do we make sure that

412
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,399
we're actually in the red area? Well,

413
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,160
we've elected to implement some insitue

414
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,480
monitoring. So, this is kind of the

415
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,280
dream setup here. Um, we right now only

416
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,039
have cameras A and C. So, the camera C

417
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,640
is looking at the side profile of this

418
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,319
miniscus, which this is another video

419
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,839
I'll play in a second. And then the

420
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,679
leading meniscus camera is looking

421
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,280
basically from this side of it. Um so we

422
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
want to be able to see is the miniscus

423
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,199
behaving from the side as well as the

424
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,839
uniformity across the miniscus miniscus

425
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,919
itself. Okay,

426
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,240
there's the video. Okay, so we see you

427
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,200
know bed is moving the film is being

428
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,120
coated and then about halfway in you'll

429
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,039
see some bubbles right here. Yeah, right

430
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,720
there you see some little bubbles start

431
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:44,080
to form. Uh so without this side profile

432
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,000
monitoring this end film looks great

433
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
like to the eye it looks like something

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
that should work and then you complete

435
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,919
it into a device and it doesn't work. Um

436
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,440
so what happened here? Well we can you

437
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
know go back to our camera and see that

438
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,960
the meniscus and the coating wasn't

439
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,120
actually as stable as we thought it

440
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,039
would be. Um so once we fix this once we

441
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,039
get a good-looking film now we need to

442
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,280
control things like the drying and

443
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,160
crystallization. So I'll come back on

444
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,480
the other side. Um so we have an example

445
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,320
here of the drying crystallization. We

446
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
have three different solvents.

447
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,640
Essentially all you need to get from

448
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,600
this is that we can push the uh

449
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,400
stability of the wet film further and

450
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,400
further for longer times with this uh

451
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,320
mixture of solvents here. And that

452
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,480
allows us a bigger window to control the

453
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,720
drying and crystallization patterns. Um

454
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,360
that's all well and good. Doesn't matter

455
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,960
if it doesn't work. Um but it does work

456
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,760
as the title says proof is in the

457
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,000
perkite pudding. Um and we so we have

458
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,320
structurally made a good perovsky with

459
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,480
this XRD plot. We can see that all these

460
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,360
peaks are accounted for. This FAPBI3 is

461
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,440
perovsky. Um lead there's a little peak

462
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,440
there. Not too worried about that. Um so

463
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,360
structurally we made a good film.

464
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,679
Visually with SEM we've made a pretty

465
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,160
good crystal. You see that the grains

466
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,039
are you know about 750 nanometers a

467
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,039
micron wide. uh they're pretty pretty

468
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,360
compact, nice and dense. There's not a

469
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,960
lot of stuff at the grain boundaries. Um

470
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,360
so we've been able to make structurally

471
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,160
a good film and visually a good film. Um

472
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,559
and then we can go to the JV tester and

473
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,000
actually test if it is a good film. So

474
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,720
this 16 1.5% number here is when you

475
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,200
finish up this 50 mm by 50 miller

476
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,360
substrate here into a device. So the

477
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,000
next step here is to basically translate

478
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,559
this which is completely sauté coated um

479
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,919
into something like this which is a 4 in

480
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,080
x 4 in module um made on a flexible

481
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,400
plastic substrate.

482
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,039
So with that I just want to thank the

483
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,960
facilities at MIT Nano. This XRD plot

484
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,120
was collected on the you know fourth

485
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,360
floor building 13. This was collected

486
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,559
inside of characterization.no and then

487
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,960
all the fab was done inside of fab.no.

488
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,120
Um so again I just want to thank the

489
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,440
staff and facilities at MIT Nano as well

490
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,840
as my many colleagues in the one lab

491
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,120
including professor Vladimir Bovich um

492
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,120
Dr. Rahul Pachadar and Dr. Tamar Kadosh

493
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,960
um as well as our sponsors at the CEDO

494
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:15,240
office in the department of energy as

495
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,240
well as Petronis. So yeah thank you.

496
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,480
>> Hello everyone. Uh I am Alex. I have

497
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,400
done a variety of things around nano and

498
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
mtl for those of you who are familiar

499
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,880
with it. Uh and I'm going to tell you

500
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,600
about one of the more interesting

501
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,559
translational projects that I've done

502
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,880
that takes in as inspiration a lot of

503
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,520
principles we have as nano applies a few

504
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,679
of them and has resulted in something

505
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,280
pretty cool. Uh and that is art

506
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,320
restoration. Um art restoration not a

507
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,520
conventional nano subject. Um it is one

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,919
of the more bespoke uh areas of

509
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,919
expertise for people working in art

510
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,760
conservation. It involves a lot of

511
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,760
manual labor. Uh and basically I thought

512
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,240
around four years ago, what if we tried

513
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,159
to do something that involved any amount

514
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,880
of technology and wasn't just someone

515
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,480
sitting with a brush and in

516
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,559
a lot of the work that I've done here

517
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,400
has nothing to do with art restoration.

518
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,600
I've worked on things spanning medical

519
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,159
diagnostics, the growth of nanowires for

520
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,039
improving ionization efficiency, new

521
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,039
forms of electron lithography. Um, and

522
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,919
working on all of those has taught me

523
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,320
about precision. And I think nano really

524
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,760
is a lot about precision and working at

525
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,840
small scales and knowing what's

526
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,760
happening chemically, physically,

527
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,880
structurally in the design of new

528
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,120
devices and technologies. So, what I've

529
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,440
done to improve art restoration is to

530
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,919
take a damaged painting, apply a variety

531
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,400
of AI models to identify damages within

532
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,559
it, and then create a multi-layer mask

533
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,200
that goes over it to physically restore

534
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,480
it. And this is an exercise in

535
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,320
precision. Over 5,000 areas are restored

536
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
this way in under three hours. This is

537
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,600
almost two orders of magnitude quicker

538
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,320
than it could be done by hand. And this

539
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,200
involves quite a few interesting

540
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,960
structural aspects. So firstly, one of

541
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,039
the cool things that we can do is apply

542
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,600
some of the AI tools. So people here are

543
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,320
working on designing chips to create AI

544
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,200
models. We can use those to do digital

545
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,600
inpainting of damaged images of artworks

546
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,679
and result in digitally restored ones.

547
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
And then as many of you are familiar

548
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,400
with masks being used in nano and

549
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,240
fabrication, we can derive a mask of all

550
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,280
the areas that actually need to be

551
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,159
inpainted on a particular artwork. So

552
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,880
that mask comprises a series of color

553
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,799
accurate layers that are bound together

554
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,440
with a variety of membranes and

555
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,799
conservation grade varnishes. This mask

556
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,240
is truly quite thin. It is around 30

557
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,240
micrometers at its thickest. Um, it's

558
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,840
really difficult to handle. It is at the

559
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,159
limit of what humids could actually

560
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,400
interact with pretty reasonably. Um,

561
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
there's a cross-section of it. And once

562
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,799
it's applied over an artwork, it

563
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,520
physically masks damages to result in a

564
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,440
digitally restored version of an

565
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,600
artwork, but actually physically

566
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,919
manifested. Now, the cool thing about

567
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,840
this membrane, it's made of shortchain

568
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,679
hydrocarbons that are bound together

569
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,240
with varnishes that contain UV

570
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,240
absorbers. So, this mask is expected to

571
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,559
be able to work to preserve artworks for

572
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,960
around a century. And it's also very

573
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,760
easy to remove. It's bound to artworks

574
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,760
with a partly oxidized layer of varnish

575
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,679
so that it can be pretty simply peeled

576
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,200
off without damaging an underlying

577
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,280
artwork. So, that's just a taste of some

578
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,840
of the cool things that go into that.

579
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,159
Um, this is an incredibly quick process.

580
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,120
It restores thousands of damages in a

581
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,640
way that's parallelized and can rely on

582
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,440
some of the precision that's possible

583
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,440
with digital tools. Um, this has been

584
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,840
described by conservators across the

585
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,520
world as phenomenally cool, making their

586
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,679
lives easier, better, faster, and

587
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,600
cheaper. And I think that's kind of a

588
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,000
description of nano more broadly. I

589
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,840
think Nano is phenomenally cool. And it

590
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,840
makes a lot of people's lives easier,

591
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,440
better, faster, cheaper. And I hope you

592
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,600
appreciate some of the really cool

593
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,480
projects that emerge out of the space

594
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,320
and the labs that use it. So if you want

595
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,559
to learn more about this, I published

596
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,559
this in Nature. You can go read that. We

597
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,559
are raising money, so tell your rich art

598
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,960
friends to give their money to me. Thank

599
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,960
you so much.

600
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,559
Unfortunately, I have to bring the topic

601
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,440
back to the boring nanop fabrication. Uh

602
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,520
I'm Ishwan from Palasio's group at MIT

603
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,600
and I'll be telling you guys about our

604
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,760
work on the 2D transition metal

605
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,039
decoides. It's uh synthetis and uh from

606
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,440
system and integration applications.

607
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,640
So as all of you probably heard multiple

608
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,799
times today uh the mors law is chasing

609
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
us and as we're approaching the scaling

610
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,919
limit of the silicon devices we have to

611
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,360
look for new materials that as potential

612
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,480
channel material uh candidates for for

613
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,640
beyond uh the current technology

614
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,960
scalings. So one strong candidate would

615
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,240
be for the 2D materials and the 2D

616
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,720
materials not only can be a great

617
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:27,679
candidate for the front end of line uh

618
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,919
transistor devices and it also have um

619
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,440
capabilities to be added as the back and

620
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,400
line integration uh devices such as the

621
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,799
the quantum uh technologies and for

622
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,400
neuromorphic computing devices and

623
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,120
photonic integrated circuits and to uh

624
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,360
integrate 2D materials into the system

625
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,320
of the current mechanic

626
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,720
uh road map. We have several challenges

627
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,559
to overcome. Uh first we'll have the

628
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,799
materials because it's a relatively new

629
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,640
material uh compared to silicon which

630
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,720
has been around for decades. uh we have

631
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
to uh take care of the synthesis and the

632
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,360
characterization of the materials and

633
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,679
beyond that we have to look into device

634
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,279
engineering which is the scaling of the

635
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,880
uh 2D material based MOSFET devices and

636
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,520
maybe come up with some new design

637
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,600
because it's a new material and the next

638
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
step would be to integrate those into a

639
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,000
system uh that's like commercially

640
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,600
available and to do that we have to

641
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,440
consider the design technological co-op

642
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,520
optimization and system technological

643
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,400
co-op optimization.

644
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,559
So first of all we look at the synthesis

645
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,039
the part of work we do is to synthesize

646
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,600
the high performance 2D materials both n

647
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,400
type and ptype. Uh so for N type we'll

648
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,240
have Malibin dulfide and for Pype we'll

649
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:48,240
have tonselonide from the SEM images and

650
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,240
the OMA images here um well mostly

651
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,760
oh the OM image doesn't really tell much

652
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,320
from the SEM images here you can see the

653
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,880
uh we have deposited like quite uniform

654
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,640
model layer across the surface and from

655
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,039
the sharp peaks of the ramen and

656
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,880
photooluminescence uh spectrums you can

657
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,240
see the the optical quality of these

658
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,919
materials are pretty

659
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,080
And after we make them into MOSFET

660
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,799
devices, uh their performance in terms

661
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,039
of the current density and the uh the

662
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,600
opto uh the output characteristics are

663
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,480
pretty excellent. And but these are

664
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,159
small scale fabrications to make these

665
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,279
um compatible for foundaries for

666
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,559
industries. We have to scale up. So to

667
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,720
to scale up the the deposition of the um

668
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,799
2D materials, we have uh built this

669
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,760
customized the MLCVD system that is

670
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,080
capable of depositing MOS2 at um on the

671
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,799
8 in platforms and is also capable of

672
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,840
doing so at a back end of line cap

673
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,840
silicon compatible temperature 400° C.

674
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,840
And from these

675
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,440
I went over. So from these uh um device

676
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,039
statistics and the mobility and

677
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,080
threshold voltage maps, we can see the

678
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,440
material is quite uniform for in terms

679
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,600
of the uh 8 inch wafer scale.

680
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,360
And now that we have the materials,

681
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,919
we're looking at some uh device

682
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,159
engineering part. So with the uh FAB

683
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,480
capability at MIT Nano and materials

684
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,120
that we grow, we were able to make some

685
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,200
of the world's smallest transistors uh

686
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,520
with the physical channel length of 2.8

687
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,000
8 nometers and they performed

688
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,480
exceptionally well uh in terms of their

689
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,240
uh scale and to increase the performance

690
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,559
as well as the uh response time um we

691
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,880
also looking into building these uh

692
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,880
multi- channelannel MOS transistor which

693
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,840
means instead of one channels we have

694
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,080
now have two channels of MOS2 as well as

695
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,720
three gates to improve the control and

696
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,440
current density as you can see from here

697
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,279
and you know these new materials like

698
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,679
people always people from The industry

699
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,000
always ask uh what good are they if

700
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,559
they're not reliable. So we also perform

701
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,480
these reli reliability study for MOS2

702
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,240
transistors and from the uh the positive

703
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
bias temperature instability test and

704
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,559
the healthcare injection test we can see

705
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,240
these MOS transistors in terms of

706
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,720
stability are comparable to the current

707
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,279
silicon uh NOS devices

708
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
and step up from the front end line

709
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,720
devices. Now we look at the back end of

710
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,120
line integration uh functionalities

711
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,840
which ah it's animation. So uh first we

712
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,159
have the graphing based bio sensor. Um

713
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,760
it is a um functionalized by uh

714
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
functionalized the graphing based sensor

715
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,840
and can be made into a rate and

716
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,159
integrated into uh with the with the PCB

717
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,520
system into a complete uh system that

718
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,399
can analyze say your breath to tell uh

719
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,360
very health conditions which has um a

720
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,520
lot of interest from the health

721
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,440
industries and also we're making these

722
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,200
MOS2 based hydrogen sensor which can

723
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,679
tell uh which is functionalized by

724
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,279
palladium palladium uh pad platium And

725
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,679
it can uh increase in current in

726
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:01,679
response to the presence of hydrogen uh

727
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,919
which is uh brings uh you know hydrogen

728
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,760
sensing capability to to your micro

729
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,960
electronic systems. So all of these

730
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,159
works that we've done in the past uh are

731
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,760
uh quite terrific if I can say that and

732
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,760
uh we're keep exploring new

733
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,760
opportunities for the 2D material

734
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,360
applications and obviously not none of

735
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,440
this can be done without the uh the help

736
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,360
of MIT nano and our sponsors and uh my

737
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,279
lovely group and collaborators professor

738
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,960
Jin Khan and Jetty. Thanks. And if

739
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,000
you're interested in my research, uh you

740
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,200
can ask about them in the Q&A session or

741
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,200
we can connect afterwards. Thank you.

742
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,120
>> Um good afternoon. I'm Sen. I'm a postto

743
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,720
at uh the Roland Institute at Harvard.

744
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,799
And today I'm going to talk about how we

745
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,880
use a advanced electron microscopy

746
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,679
techniques um like the one you have in

747
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,000
MIT nano to study a tiny tiny scale

748
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,360
distortions a peer scale distortion in

749
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,240
quantum materials like the one you're

750
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,080
seeing here in uranium oxyelide with

751
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,600
this uh beautiful super modulated

752
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,000
structures.

753
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,840
So to back up, so quantum materials. So

754
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
these are things these are the materials

755
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,760
where the electrons in their crystals

756
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,320
like to interact strongly with

757
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,039
themselves as as well as the crystal

758
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,919
itself and in doing so uh shows

759
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,520
unexpected and often a super material

760
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,760
properties. These include things like

761
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,919
superc conductivity, metal to insulate

762
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,000
transitions and a lot more. And they

763
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
have they hold a tremendous perspective

764
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,080
for being ne uh foundation for the next

765
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,519
generation electronics, quantum

766
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,640
computing, advanced sensing and

767
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,799
detections and more.

768
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,320
One of the key feature of these material

769
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,080
is that these electrons likes to

770
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,919
interact strongly with the lattice that

771
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,399
they reside in. So for instance one

772
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,399
titanium dulfide is a classic quantum 2D

773
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,919
material where at high temperature at

774
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,840
room temperature it it conducts

775
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,640
electricity quite well. But once you

776
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,480
cool down below 100 Kelvin or so they

777
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
suddenly becomes insulator. So it shows

778
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,640
a metal to insulator transition. And

779
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,960
when that happens these atoms actually

780
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,120
moves a tiny amount uh from their

781
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,519
original uh lattice position. So they

782
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,640
distort about few pometers that is

783
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,760
1,000th of nanometer. So as a electron

784
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,559
microscopist what we aim to do is we aim

785
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,120
to look at the atomic positions atom by

786
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,480
atom and map those distortions pometer

787
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,559
scale distortions using the microscopes.

788
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,159
So the microscope technique that we use

789
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,679
is called scanning transmission electron

790
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,480
microscopy.

791
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,240
Uh in essentially what we do is we boil

792
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,159
off electrons from hot metal and we

793
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,799
accelerate them to high voltage here

794
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,519
300,000 volt and at that energy the

795
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,840
electrons are now moving at half of the

796
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,760
speed of the light and then we use a

797
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,679
highly um engineered set of

798
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,760
electromagnetic lenses to focus them

799
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,840
down to single point smaller than

800
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,519
one/10enth of nanometer and then we use

801
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,519
those electron beam to probe our

802
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,519
materials.

803
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,440
Sounds science fictiony, but if you go

804
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,039
down to the basement of MIT nano, they

805
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,679
actually have multiple of those

806
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:16,080
microscopes and we can use those

807
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:19,039
microscope to form image like this. So

808
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,399
here the each one of those fuzzy little

809
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,480
white spheres are columns of atoms. The

810
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,159
brighter ones are heavy tentum atoms and

811
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,640
the lighter ones are sulfur atoms. So we

812
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,760
have tools where we can see atoms uh

813
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,760
column by column.

814
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,799
So uranium oxyloride these are newly

815
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,120
rediscovered quantum 2D materials and if

816
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,000
you look at uh the lattice structure uh

817
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,480
you see the atoms are arranged in in

818
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,080
square lattice pattern.

819
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,320
If you were to look at it from the side

820
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,360
view, you will note that the yellow

821
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,159
tarium atoms here are separated with uh

822
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,960
has big separations

823
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,120
and um in fact these are so weakly

824
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,480
bonded that you can use literally scotch

825
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,880
tape to exfoliate uh mono mono or few

826
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,119
layers and you can in fact transfer onto

827
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,919
a flat surfaces and even do nanop

828
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,919
fabrication onto them.

829
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,520
So my collaborators at Harvard uh

830
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,520
measured the electronic properties of

831
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,280
this crystal along the horizontal axis

832
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,320
and they found that it was quite

833
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,280
insulating and because your crystal here

834
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,879
is forming a square pattern you'd expect

835
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,520
that you should be insulating both in

836
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,480
the horizontal axis as well as vertical

837
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,560
axis. But to our surprise we found out

838
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,879
that along the vertical axis it was

839
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,720
actually quite conductive and was uh

840
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,919
quite metallic.

841
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,919
So this is quite contradictory of itself

842
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,079
because if I'm sitting here in the

843
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,320
crystal and looking at these atoms, it

844
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,639
should be same vertical versus

845
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,159
horizontal. But if I'm electron here

846
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,679
sitting in this crystal, now the

847
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,560
vertical is quite different than the

848
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,040
horizontal. So that's where I come in as

849
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,800
electron microscopist. So I grab the

850
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,880
sample from Cambridge, the west side of

851
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,960
Cambridge, and take the T, go to MIT

852
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,280
nano and put the sample into one of

853
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
these microscopes. And this is what we

854
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,200
get.

855
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,760
So once again these fuzzy dots are

856
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,160
columns of atoms and we are seeing these

857
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,680
square lattice patterns as we were

858
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,160
expecting.

859
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,000
But if you have good eyes for these kind

860
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,040
of things and if you actually squint a

861
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,720
little bit to make all the uh to to make

862
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,760
your vision a little blurriier you might

863
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,599
able to see there is a faint modulations

864
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,400
of intensities.

865
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,640
Okay. So this immediately answers some

866
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,720
questions. the the reason why electrons

867
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,520
were flowing one way but not the other

868
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,880
way is because the lattice is not

869
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,160
actually square. There's something going

870
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,520
on horizontally versus vertically. Of

871
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,240
course, we wanted to really understand

872
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,000
what was going on. So, we decided to uh

873
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,240
take the sample out, prepare another

874
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
sample along the cross-sectional axis

875
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,440
and take a look at what it looks like.

876
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,760
And to our pleasant surprise,

877
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,640
this is what it looks like.

878
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,520
So the most striking feature here uh it

879
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,560
would be this black dark intensities

880
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,400
arranged everywhere and if we zoom in a

881
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,960
little bit you will see that those dark

882
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,359
intensities are voids. So what's

883
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
happening is instead of these layers

884
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,560
being completely flat they form a wiggly

885
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,720
set of layers. So we have a supervised

886
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,440
modulation of the crystallin structure

887
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,240
where it becomes this uh corrugated

888
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,920
layers instead of a flat layers. So we

889
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,640
have something like this where electrons

890
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,240
like to flow along the valleys and

891
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,240
troughs but not not across them. So now

892
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,920
that we have some understanding of

893
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,839
what's going on you know the obvious

894
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,320
next question is what can we do with

895
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,400
this? So it turns out that this

896
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,480
displacements these modulations are not

897
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,520
pure sinosoidal and it has a lot of

898
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,400
higher harmonic components to it and and

899
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,320
in combination of all of that they

900
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,880
actually break a specific set of crystal

901
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,560
symmetry. uh here it breaks inversion

902
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,720
symmetry as well as the time reversal

903
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,359
symmetry and then because uranium atoms

904
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,280
are uh magnetic uh we can actually use

905
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,520
them to generate spin current out of

906
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,680
this crystal and maybe use it as a spin

907
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,440
current source for um spintronics

908
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,119
devices.

909
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,520
Okay, to wrap up, uh we imaged a a piece

910
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,839
of uranium oxyoride crystal using MIT

911
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,000
nanos microscope and we discovered this

912
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,040
beautiful super modulation pattern that

913
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,440
was hiding within. Um I want to thank

914
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,680
all of my collaborators as well as Dr.

915
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,520
Aubrey Pen who babysits the microscope

916
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,480
every single day to its best of

917
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,480
capabilities. Thank you.

918
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,400
Okay. Um, hi everyone. Thanks for

919
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,800
coming. Thanks to the organizers for

920
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,520
organizing this summit. Uh, my name is

921
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,520
Ahmed. I'm a grad student in physics in

922
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,240
the group of uh, Professor Kum at MIT.

923
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,160
And today's talk is going to be based on

924
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,040
our recent work on photonics with a two

925
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,800
dimensional magnet.

926
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,680
Okay.

927
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,160
So, light is the fastest and the

928
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,240
cleanest information carrier we know and

929
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,359
photonics is the science and technology

930
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,680
of it. It underpins uh modern life from

931
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,000
the global internet to advanced

932
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,359
manufacturing.

933
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,200
Part of the reason why it's so

934
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,839
successful is because we know how to

935
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,079
solve. We know how to solve Maxwell's

936
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,839
equations

937
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,680
and the materials that are used in

938
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,640
photonics are mature. They're very

939
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,320
wellstied. They're reliable.

940
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Unfortunately, they don't give us many

941
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,800
new surprises anymore and not a lot of

942
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,880
knobs to turn.

943
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,359
It's also fair to characterize photonics

944
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,680
as an engineer's field as much as a

945
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,079
physicist because you can design

946
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,760
something, simulate, fabricate, and in

947
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,359
the end what you get is usually what you

948
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,119
expected.

949
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,200
Quantum materials on the other hand are

950
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,200
solids where the collective behavior of

951
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,599
electrons gives rise to entirely new

952
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,440
states of matter. Superconductors,

953
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:24,640
unconventional magnets, you name it.

954
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,400
Unfortunately, um, oh, I forgot. Um,

955
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,320
these properties because they're so

956
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,079
special, they can go far beyond what the

957
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,160
ordinary materials can offer.

958
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,839
Unfortunately, it's very hard to predict

959
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,480
their properties because we don't really

960
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,960
have a Maxwell's equation uh equivalent

961
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,839
to guide us.

962
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,640
Um they have rich degree they offer a

963
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:49,520
very rich um they offer a very u rich

964
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,520
landscape of degrees of freedom. Spins,

965
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,839
charges, lattice, they're all

966
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,280
intertwined. And if you tune one knob,

967
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,359
several others are pulled on at once.

968
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,000
And lastly, it's firmly a physicist

969
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,720
field because we do the experiments, we

970
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,359
uncover often unexpected things and

971
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:12,720
theory struggles to catch up.

972
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,880
Um, it's this uh middle part, it's the

973
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,040
apparent orthogonality of these fields

974
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,599
that's interesting to us both from a

975
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,560
basic fundamental perspective but also a

976
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,079
technological one. We work in the middle

977
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,400
where the intersection promises bringing

978
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,240
best of both worlds together. And this

979
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,960
is what what I'm going to be uh talking

980
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,640
about today especially uh when it comes

981
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,480
to using the rich degrees of freedom

982
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,720
freedoms of quantum materials and how

983
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,200
they're intertwined.

984
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,880
Uh we recently became interested in this

985
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,839
uh two-dimensional material called

986
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,960
chromospher bromine. Um this is a two

987
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,359
dimensional material. It's an

988
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,640
antiaromagnetic uh insulator

989
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,119
semiconductor and uh once you cool it

990
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,280
down interestingly the chromium atoms in

991
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,760
plane point in the same direction it's

992
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,680
an inplane uh in the in plane it's a

993
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,079
ferroagnet but if you look at out of

994
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,520
plane the chromium atoms are pointing in

995
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,960
opposite directions the spins are

996
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,400
pointing in opposite directions so it

997
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,720
goes right left right left and also

998
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,880
quite interestingly the material has

999
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,800
very strong optical exitations called

1000
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
exatons that determine its optical

1001
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,319
response in the near infrared and the

1002
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,040
visible.

1003
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,280
Uh what's very surprising

1004
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,280
uh and highlighting the rich degrees of

1005
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,640
freedom of quantum materials is that

1006
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,200
these two seemingly unrelated degrees of

1007
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,319
freedom are very strongly intertwined.

1008
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,319
If you apply a little bit of magnetic

1009
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,400
field to change the uh relative

1010
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,680
orientation between the spins of two

1011
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,680
layers, it turns out this changes the

1012
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,040
resonance energy of these exitations,

1013
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,400
these exatons. What this translates into

1014
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,079
is that you can tune the magnetic you

1015
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,720
can tune the optical response of this

1016
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,000
material by applying magnetic fields.

1017
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,040
One can think of this as a strongly

1018
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,920
tunable continuously tunable color. Here

1019
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,520
we extracted the permitivities

1020
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,599
uh corresponding to two different

1021
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,839
magnetic configurations.

1022
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,359
And if you look at the y-axis here, the

1023
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,240
relative permitivity, real relative

1024
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,599
permitivity goes up to 800. And if you

1025
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,800
want to compare this to silicon or

1026
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:26,960
silicon nitride that are uh very common

1027
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,359
materials for more common photonics uh

1028
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,560
for silicon the relative permitivity is

1029
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,000
13 and for silicon nitrite it's four. So

1030
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,640
you wouldn't even be able to see them if

1031
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,720
I pull out it here.

1032
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,560
Okay. So we have something quite

1033
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,920
interesting at hand and we want to do

1034
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,960
something interesting with it. So we

1035
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,400
want to nanopattern this material. Um,

1036
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,040
I'm not going to go into details of the

1037
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,480
nanop fabrication too much, but we use a

1038
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,319
quite unconventional method of

1039
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,720
nanopatterning. If you ask me questions,

1040
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,400
I'd be happy to answer them. Uh, we

1041
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,040
bring Oops. We bring uh silicon nit

1042
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,440
membranes to MIT nano. We mill them with

1043
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,839
the focused ion beams at the basement.

1044
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,599
We bring them back to our lab. We

1045
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,880
transfer these silicon nit membranes on

1046
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,480
top of the material of interest,

1047
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,880
chromium sulfur bromide in this case,

1048
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,160
and then we edge through. And in the

1049
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,480
end, oops, we have what's called a

1050
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:23,040
photonic crystal. So a photonic crystal

1051
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,280
is an artificial structure that is

1052
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,240
designed to control the flow of light.

1053
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,359
And some of these photonic crystals have

1054
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,720
traps, some resonant modes that can, you

1055
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:37,520
know, trap light. And the quantifying

1056
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,119
measure of this trapping as to how many

1057
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,119
times the light is going to be bouncing

1058
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,720
back and forth within the material until

1059
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,119
it leaks out is called the quality

1060
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,200
factor or the Q factor.

1061
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,960
Um, we made these photonic crystals and

1062
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,800
if you look at what the photonic crystal

1063
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,440
looks like, it's almost boring. There's

1064
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,280
nothing special about the photonic

1065
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,480
crystal itself, but the material itself

1066
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,200
is very interesting. Um,

1067
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,040
yeah. So we pattern these materials. We

1068
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,839
send light. We collect it back. We look

1069
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,240
at the reflectivity. And if this was not

1070
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,520
patterned, if this was just a simple

1071
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,760
slab, you would see a smooth curve here.

1072
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,000
But instead, we start seeing these dips,

1073
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,319
these traps, so to say. And these traps,

1074
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,160
if you calculate the quality factor, it

1075
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,040
turns out they're over a thou uh the

1076
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,160
quality factors of these resonances are

1077
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,560
over a thousand. This is already a very

1078
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,960
large number for the kind of mode that

1079
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,119
this is and I'm not I'm going to skip

1080
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,319
the details but feel free to ask me that

1081
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,839
later. What's really remarkable is these

1082
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,839
traps

1083
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:46,400
can exist when the this photonic crystal

1084
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,200
is as thin as about 2% of the wavelength

1085
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,520
of light in air.

1086
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,960
We did we did we carried out other

1087
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,280
measurements. we carried out other nanop

1088
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,760
fabrication u designs and we see very

1089
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,800
similar things. What's even more

1090
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,640
interesting is because of this

1091
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,960
interconnectedness between these two

1092
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,760
degrees of freedom, the optics and the

1093
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,920
magnetic order, if we apply a little bit

1094
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,359
of magnetic field, we can tune these

1095
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,960
modes from one wavelength to the other

1096
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,119
continuously if we don't like where the

1097
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:24,160
motor is sitting. And this uh this

1098
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,000
happens because whenever we change the

1099
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,119
magnetic ground state of the material,

1100
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,520
the permitivity changes up to about 100

1101
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,720
uh sorry 800 which is one to two orders

1102
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,880
of magnitude larger than most uh tunable

1103
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,440
materials.

1104
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:45,200
Um just to conclude, we uh

1105
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,280
we fabricated ultra thin uh photonic

1106
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,839
crystals made out of this quantum

1107
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,480
material chromium sulfur bromine. And we

1108
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:56,400
demonstrated continuous tunability of

1109
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,480
these modes. And um next steps are

1110
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,560
making photonics more interesting by

1111
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,720
incorporating quantum materials within

1112
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,319
this structure or vice versa making

1113
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,319
quantum materials more interesting and

1114
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,640
functional by using them in already

1115
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,480
established nanopotonic architectures.

1116
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,400
Um thanks for listening and I'd like to

1117
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,800
quickly flash uh my collaborators and

1118
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,800
the funding agencies.

1119
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,800
Hi everyone. I am uh Somu. I'm currently

1120
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,560
a PhD student uh in mechanical

1121
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,880
engineering working with professor

1122
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,240
Carlos Portella. Uh this talk is going

1123
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,920
to be a little different from the themes

1124
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,240
that you've seen before but I'm going to

1125
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,680
talk about uh shellbased porous meta

1126
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,680
materials, how you can scalably

1127
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,760
fabricate them and a little bit about

1128
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,839
their mechanics. So when we

1129
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,599
traditionally think about materials we

1130
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,880
think about making changes at the atomic

1131
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,720
or molecular scale and when you by doing

1132
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,480
this we've uncovered several different

1133
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,000
classes of materials like metals,

1134
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,079
ceramics, polymers etc. Uh and here's a

1135
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,520
plot of uh the compressive strength

1136
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,359
versus density for all of these

1137
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,200
different classes of materials. Now if

1138
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,160
you want to think about lightweight

1139
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,319
materials, one way to do that is to sort

1140
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,319
of make voids at the micron or

1141
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,000
millimeter scale. And by doing that you

1142
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,640
have a new class of materials called

1143
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,119
foams. Uh but if you look at this plot

1144
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,760
there is this large area in the middle

1145
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,760
which is just an unexplored design space

1146
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,760
which is below the theoretical limit.

1147
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,359
And it's particularly useful because

1148
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,760
those are lightweight high strength

1149
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,240
materials. And you can think of

1150
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,000
applications for this in uh one possible

1151
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,040
application could be space technology

1152
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,359
where every gram of weight saved is is

1153
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,839
thousands of dollars saved in in payload

1154
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,000
costs. So the question then is how can

1155
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,599
we reach that design space? With

1156
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,280
advances in additive manufacturing

1157
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,839
technology, specifically techniques like

1158
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,040
two photon lithography, we can shine a

1159
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:57,440
laser onto a resin and and print

1160
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,960
structures at the micro scale. The

1161
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,880
structure that you see here is a

1162
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,560
structure that was printed at MIT nano

1163
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,800
using the two photon lithography tool

1164
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,119
there. And with that we are now able to

1165
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,200
move away from these aperiodic foam like

1166
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,760
materials to more periodic truss and

1167
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,599
beam based materials and start pushing

1168
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,599
closer and closer to that theoretical

1169
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,440
limit. And not just that we can use

1170
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,560
other structural elements like plates

1171
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,160
and shells and really push the limit on

1172
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,240
what is possible. Um, but if you'll take

1173
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,640
a closer look at these different studies

1174
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,480
that you have here and you look at what

1175
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,119
length scales these materials operate

1176
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,800
at, you will see that the smallest

1177
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,200
feature size is usually in the order of

1178
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,880
hundreds of nanometers and the total

1179
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,640
sample volume that was tested for

1180
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,760
mechanical properties is usually like

1181
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,920
hundreds of microns. So then the

1182
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,960
question is is there a way to scale it

1183
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,839
up? If you look at nature for example,

1184
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,079
bone is an amazing meta material where

1185
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,240
the smallest feature size is just tens

1186
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,240
of nanometers, but the actual sample

1187
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,680
size is basically the size of a human

1188
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,839
being. Right? So the these periodic

1189
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,599
latises that we're able to make offer a

1190
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,720
lot of mechanical efficiency and

1191
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,960
tunability, but then nature has figured

1192
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,720
out the scalability part of things. So

1193
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,640
the question is can we combine these

1194
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,119
two? And that's where my research comes

1195
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,520
in. It's to look see how we can scalably

1196
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,760
manufacture metamaterials and how we can

1197
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,400
individually tune the knobs at different

1198
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,000
length scales. So to answer the first

1199
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,559
question, we take inspiration from

1200
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,640
nature where we use a process called

1201
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,800
spinodal decomposition where you have a

1202
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,960
polymer and a solvent and when you heat

1203
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,520
it up, the polymer phase separates and

1204
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,680
freezes in in in its place and from that

1205
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,240
you can get this epoxy template and you

1206
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,880
can make large volumes of this material.

1207
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,640
You can then use coating techniques uh

1208
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,559
such as metal and ceramic coatings that

1209
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,559
you have at MIT Nano to coat these

1210
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,319
materials and then burn away the

1211
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,920
polymer, ash it away to get these

1212
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,760
bicontinuous pinal shells uh with shell

1213
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,160
thicknesses in the orders of tens of

1214
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,559
nanometers and you can make hundreds of

1215
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,200
cubic cm of this sample in a matter of

1216
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,040
minutes. But before I go on talking

1217
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,680
about how we can actually achieve this

1218
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,599
in lab, uh one question that might come

1219
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,160
up is are these structures mechanically

1220
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,240
efficient? To do that here I have a

1221
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,800
computational simulation of the process

1222
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,920
and I can extract a 3D geomet 3D

1223
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,839
structure of the polymer. I can then go

1224
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,400
ahead and actually print this using two

1225
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,400
photon lithography techniques at nano

1226
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,559
and coat them using atomic layer

1227
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,720
deposition and then ash away the polymer

1228
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,520
and I get this very interesting thin

1229
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,040
ceramic shell which is a spodal

1230
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,520
structure and the shell thickness is

1231
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,440
only 10 nanome and you'll see something

1232
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,760
amazing. This is a ceramic a glass-like

1233
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,839
material and I can put this under the

1234
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,920
SEM and couple it with our nano and

1235
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:51,280
enter and you'll see what happens when I

1236
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,440
compress it. It behaves like rubber, an

1237
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,599
elastic material. And I can compress

1238
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,640
this multiple times and you'll see that

1239
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,920
it is able to completely restore each

1240
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:05,040
and every single time. And this shell is

1241
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,960
again just 10 nanometers thick. Um, and

1242
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,720
the whole unit cell itself is about 100

1243
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,040
microns.

1244
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,880
So if you actually go ahead and measure

1245
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,640
the strength and stiffness and try to

1246
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,720
sort of look at where it falls in the

1247
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,800
context of the materials that I

1248
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,800
presented previously, you will see that

1249
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,839
it it performs much better than foams.

1250
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,240
It's much lighter and has pretty good

1251
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,079
mechanical properties as well. So now to

1252
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,000
answer the second question which is how

1253
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,559
can we actually make this in lab and how

1254
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,559
can we tune the different knobs. Uh the

1255
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,920
so the uh to answer that question at the

1256
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,160
macro scale what we can do is that we

1257
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,160
can we have this interesting mold that

1258
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,119
we made where you can fill it up with

1259
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,359
this polymer blend and then heat it up

1260
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,960
and you can make these epoxy templates

1261
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,359
of different shapes and sizes at the

1262
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,640
macro scale and if you zoom in you'll

1263
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,720
have this interesting spinodal

1264
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,400
morphology at the micros scale. You can

1265
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,480
also tune the structure at the micro

1266
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,559
scale by changing the temperature and

1267
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,960
composition of the process and you can

1268
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,800
get more smaller pores or you can get

1269
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,599
much larger pores. So you can you have

1270
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,839
some control on the microscopic um

1271
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,000
properties as well. And finally at the

1272
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,480
nanocale you can coat this using

1273
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,400
aluminina uh using atomic layer

1274
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,119
deposition with aluminina and

1275
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,000
essentially get nanome thick aluminina

1276
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,800
shells. And so sort of going back to

1277
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,800
where I started which is this idea that

1278
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,760
can we combine the mechanical efficiency

1279
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,000
of these periodic metamaterials with the

1280
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,480
scalability of a periodic metamaterials.

1281
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,960
We now have a system which we we call

1282
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,040
selfarchchitected metamaterials which

1283
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,040
span nine orders of magnitudes in length

1284
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,960
scales from the smallest feature size

1285
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,599
that's only a few nanometers to actual

1286
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,079
sample size that are a few centimeters.

1287
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,200
and we're closer to realizing this dream

1288
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,640
of combining nature scalability with the

1289
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,800
mechanical efficiency of man-made

1290
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,119
structures. With that, I would like to

1291
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,760
acknowledge uh the group this portella

1292
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,920
research group. Uh also uh this work was

1293
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,079
possible due to support from NSF math

1294
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,160
works and a lot of technical support and

1295
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:09,400
mentorship from MIT nano. Uh thank you

1296
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,400
so much

1297
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,520
Hello. Hello.

1298
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,040
All right. So, u last talk of the

1299
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,880
session. Um thanks for staying around.

1300
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,520
My name is Skyome and I'm a postto here

1301
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,079
at MIT. So, I will be talking about sort

1302
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,240
of our work on developing a high yield

1303
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,079
200 millimeter wafer scale processes for

1304
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,160
quantum hardware at MIT.no. Nano.

1305
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,680
So computing has really transformed our

1306
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,319
way of living and we believe the next

1307
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,559
leap is quantum computing. But um there

1308
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,640
still faces two major hurdles which are

1309
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,200
the scale and the accuracy of quantum

1310
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,839
hardware. So if we um if we want to

1311
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,599
solve impactful problems that um even

1312
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,400
the best supercomputers today cannot

1313
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,240
solve like drug design or u material

1314
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,440
discovery or energy efficient

1315
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,280
fertilizers for crops. uh we really uh

1316
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,160
need these quantum computers with

1317
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,760
millions of cubits. But even if you just

1318
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,440
look at this um 72 cubit only u quantum

1319
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,079
computer from Google, you already see

1320
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,400
like uh such a tangle of wires over

1321
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,280
here. So these electrical wires are used

1322
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,520
to uh control and read out the

1323
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,839
information from the quantum computers.

1324
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,520
But as you can see, it's sort of a

1325
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,440
wiring nightmare already and probably

1326
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,160
won't work at scale with millions of

1327
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,640
cubits in there. Um and to make matters

1328
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,640
worse um unlike the transistors today

1329
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,040
the error rate of these cubits are

1330
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,520
inherently much noisier and with an

1331
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,599
error rate about 10 to the minus4 it

1332
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,920
means that all useful quantum algorithms

1333
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,400
will fail due to a hardware error error

1334
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,240
before they even finish.

1335
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,920
So here um at MIT u we build these uh

1336
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,680
high precision and scalable quantum

1337
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,640
hardware that help solve both these

1338
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,240
problems. So specifically uh we work on

1339
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,480
something called quantum amplifiers

1340
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,079
which is a critical component of quantum

1341
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,720
computers and what it does is really

1342
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,400
just the speaker and a microphone system

1343
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,880
like we're using now such that you can

1344
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,920
actually hear the useful information um

1345
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,319
against a noisy background. Um so

1346
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,720
compared to the existing solutions our

1347
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:26,240
quantum amplifiers can address 10 to

1348
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,720
100x more uh cubits per unit using a

1349
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,040
single output line and therefore can

1350
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,599
drastically reduce the system hardware

1351
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:36,240
um overhead footprint energy consumption

1352
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,319
and yada yada yada um and then help

1353
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,400
scale quantum computing further. And

1354
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:42,000
then at the same time because these

1355
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,640
quantum amplifiers are really accurate

1356
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,680
and fast what it can do is it enables

1357
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,200
real time fast feedback and this allows

1358
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,200
something called quantum error

1359
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,839
correction to happen which essentially

1360
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,920
is a way to self-correct and therefore

1361
00:55:53,839 --> 00:56:02,400
allows us to run these um comp long

1362
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,480
longer and complex real world problems.

1363
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,920
So for a while um these quantum

1364
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,359
amplifier sounds great but they're

1365
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,920
actually quite a feat to actually

1366
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:13,040
fabricate them and um um just for a

1367
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,480
while um only our collaborators at MIT

1368
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,799
Lincoln Lab was able to do it in the

1369
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,880
entire world and today we're very happy

1370
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:21,839
to say that we can also now make these

1371
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,040
quantum hardware um on campus ourselves

1372
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:27,760
at MIT. nano and this is actually a uh

1373
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,720
200 millm wafer that we fabricated these

1374
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,640
quantum amplifier and processor chips on

1375
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:36,400
with the reflection of the MIT dome of

1376
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,000
course. Um and so what are really inside

1377
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,480
these quantum amplifiers and quantum

1378
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,640
processors. So one things are called the

1379
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,160
Joseph's and junctions which are really

1380
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,000
the building fundamental building blocks

1381
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,960
of these quantum hardware. So what they

1382
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,440
are really are really just um these tiny

1383
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,240
metal insulator metal sandwiches with a

1384
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,000
very thin layer of uh insulator filling

1385
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,920
uh that's only about a nanometer thick

1386
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,880
such that you can utilize useful quantum

1387
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,880
tunneling effects from it. And uh making

1388
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,880
one junction is not the easiest job in

1389
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,880
the world. But and yet we have over

1390
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,119
thousands of these junctions on a single

1391
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:14,000
quantum amplifier chip. And um even even

1392
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,640
if just there's one junction failure, it

1393
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,960
will ruin the entire device. So um this

1394
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,319
is why yield really really matters. And

1395
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,799
to just to put a number into

1396
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:24,240
perspective, if you have a 99% of

1397
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,559
junction yield, that sounds pretty

1398
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,920
great, but it leads to a horrible uh

1399
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,880
near zero um device yield. And when

1400
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,040
you're at 99.9% you're really just only

1401
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,200
having about 30% of the device yield.

1402
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:40,240
And only when you get to four nights of

1403
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,680
yield do you actually would expect an

1404
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:46,319
over 90% of device yield. So really uh

1405
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,200
to see u to try to meet this bar. We

1406
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:52,000
routinely fab and test over 85,000 of

1407
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,480
these junctions per wafer. And through

1408
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,480
many optimiz optimizations on the

1409
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,839
process, we're now able to achieve near

1410
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,520
100% yield and a very good uniformity

1411
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:04,160
with less than 2% of variation across

1412
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,960
the entire 200 millimeter wafer and over

1413
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,079
a pretty large uh process window. And

1414
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,000
then the other uh um sort of uh

1415
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,000
interesting component are these things

1416
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,599
called air bridges which are really just

1417
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,880
these tiny metal overpasses that um can

1418
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,799
cross and uh hop over um different

1419
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,799
superconductors without touching each

1420
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:27,599
other. So this helps uh enhance the

1421
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:30,319
onrip connectivities

1422
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,599
and um just like the junctions we have

1423
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,359
actually thousands and thousands of

1424
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:37,440
these bridges on a single quantum

1425
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:40,079
amplifiers as well and um be and again

1426
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,160
if you can kind of imagine if a single

1427
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,079
of these arches uh collapses will

1428
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,079
actually short out the device. So we're

1429
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,680
kind of maniac so we want to make sure

1430
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,319
that our process actually up to the

1431
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,720
game. So we test over about 08 million

1432
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:55,119
of these little tiny 3D arches on a

1433
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,799
single wafer and using these um

1434
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,280
electrical test structures. So if you

1435
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,880
probe from here to here, it uh goes

1436
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,799
through 15 bridges in series for

1437
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,880
connectivity or if you probe from the

1438
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,960
blue here to the green here, it can tell

1439
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,400
you if there's any collapse bridges or

1440
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,000
shorts. So using automated um electrical

1441
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,319
probing testing we achieved and

1442
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,400
demonstrated a 99.98%

1443
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,480
um across the entire wafer and this is

1444
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,760
sufficient enough for making the quantum

1445
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,400
hardware that we uh wanted to achieve

1446
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,319
and um just very quickly since we don't

1447
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,920
have a lot of time left so even for

1448
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,920
academics there's a lot of reason to

1449
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,160
actually go with large 200 millimeter

1450
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,240
wafers instead of small samples. First

1451
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,000
of all our samples are huge because we

1452
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,680
really really want to put uh push the

1453
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,680
device performance to extreme. So each

1454
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,240
sample is about five foot by 40

1455
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,920
millimeter. So even for a 200 millimeter

1456
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,680
wafer I could only fit about 100

1457
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,359
devices. So it it's kind of a natural

1458
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,680
choice because on small samples it's

1459
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:53,599
kind of impossible to do u design

1460
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:56,000
splitting. And then um also we kind of

1461
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,640
want to have these um operational

1462
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,200
discipline and while encouraging um

1463
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,119
exploratory ideas. So just like

1464
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,720
industry, we really want these rigorous

1465
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,480
process control and these standardized

1466
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,720
test structures across many different

1467
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,400
wafers. And shown here is an example of

1468
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,640
a group of electrical test structures

1469
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,880
that we run on every single device wafer

1470
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,160
across the uh wafer everywhere as well

1471
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:21,280
like these uh dark little dots. So um

1472
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:23,760
and besides that um the wafer real

1473
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,319
estate really allows us to try these

1474
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,599
exploratory even sometimes wild design

1475
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:31,680
ideas without having to c cannibalizing

1476
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:35,520
uh slots for you know safe baseline

1477
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,040
devices and um and then actually the the

1478
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,640
this creates sort of a low-risk

1479
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,160
environment for information is actually

1480
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,079
being quite powerful and effective for

1481
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,079
us. So, one of my best designs actually

1482
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,079
comes from a quick made design that I

1483
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,160
just kind of tossed onto a existing

1484
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,839
wafer that I run for some other stuff

1485
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,119
and it turns out to be a huge winner

1486
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:54,960
actually. And um lastly um working with

1487
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,160
200 millimeter wafers allows us to

1488
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,880
access a lot of these advanced

1489
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,680
semiconductor wafer tools that um really

1490
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,760
brings these automation reproducibility

1491
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,520
safety control to a next level. And I

1492
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,960
can't stress it enough is that it really

1493
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,720
saved me a lot of huge times uh a lot of

1494
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,559
huge time savings as compared to

1495
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,319
thinking about that oh a big wafer takes

1496
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,640
more time. This is because as an

1497
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,880
example, if I want to pattern uh some

1498
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:22,079
features on a wafer, it takes manually

1499
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:24,000
about 20 more u or so minutes to do so.

1500
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,839
But these tools auto this tool is

1501
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,079
actually in nano. It takes about well

1502
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:30,079
within five minutes. And I can uh

1503
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,000
streamline a couple more wafers while

1504
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,720
unattended. And this efficiency is

1505
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,880
really a gamecher for uh this kind of

1506
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:40,319
research requiring very very good

1507
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,760
uniformity and yield.

1508
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:45,520
And um if we put together the components

1509
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,040
that we talk about, we actually get

1510
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,880
these functional high performing quantum

1511
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:53,280
amplifiers. And um if we zoom in, we

1512
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,119
kind of see these um arrays of error

1513
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,000
bridges and Joseph's injunctions that we

1514
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,400
talked about. And um they not only work,

1515
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,079
but they also we use that to demonstrate

1516
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,480
sort of the record-breaking quantum

1517
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,559
efficiency or accuracy measure um in

1518
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,040
when used for a quantum computing uh

1519
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,119
quantum computer. Um, with that I think

1520
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:14,240
that's my time. Um, and I just want to

1521
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,640
shout out to my uh labmates uh in the QC

1522
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,960
group at MIT and our collaborators for

1523
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,119
helping bringing this vision to reality.

1524
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,119
Thank you.

1525
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,960
>> Okay, thank you everyone. Uh, thank you

1526
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,880
for the wonderful speakers and I would

1527
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,520
like to use the stage and thanks MIT

1528
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,200
nano staff. Uh, like professor Strano

1529
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,359
mentioned in the previous session, the

1530
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,040
gatekeepers of the knowledge. uh we are

1531
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:41,359
lucky to have gatekeepers of knowledge

1532
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,359
some of them with us for decades. So I

1533
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:49,000
would like everyone to thank the staff

1534
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:49,000
for helping the students and uh um

1535
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:54,640
we we showed you half a percent of

1536
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,880
what's going on in MIT Nano 1500 users

1537
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,960
eight people representing uh the

1538
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,880
project. So if you want more reach out

1539
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,400
to me and we'll happily connect you with

1540
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,119
more people. Thank you.

1541
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,319
And and in fact to my my earlier

1542
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,920
question in the beginning, what do

1543
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,000
people actually do at nano? You can see

1544
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,799
the answer is anything and everything.

1545
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,880
Um I think we have time for one yes no

1546
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,960
question but no more than that. Um so

1547
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,119
maybe we'll go on to the next session.

1548
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,119
Thank you.
