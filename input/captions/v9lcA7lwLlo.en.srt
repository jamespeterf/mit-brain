1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,720
Right. So last time we were looking at a

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:21,039
function from say R. or could be some

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,439
interval in R. And then we say that and

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,439
then we have a point X in R and we say

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,439
that

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,000
that f is differentiable

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,200
[Applause]

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,120
uh at x0

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,559
if when we form this different quotient.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,559
So this was this quotion here.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:56,520
If this thing here has a limit as uh if

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,520
if this here if this here has a limit

13
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,720
as uh x go to x0

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,880
right and so again this means that there

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,880
is some number so that if x is

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,600
sufficiently close is delta close to x0

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,520
then this quotient here is close to to

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,159
that number, right? And it's always

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,200
assumed that x is not equal to, right?

20
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,439
So that the denominator makes sense. So

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,799
that that is what it means for a

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,200
function to be differentiable.

23
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,200
And then the like one of the first

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,920
things we saw was that we had a lema

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,920
uh that if

26
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,079
uh if uh f is differentiable

27
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,880
at x0 then it implies that it's also

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,880
continuous at x0. here,

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:09,119
right? And then we had uh four just very

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,959
briefly we had four uh rules that if you

31
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,200
had two functions f and g

32
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,160
and they're both differentiable and

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,520
you're looking at where you add the the

34
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,239
two functions then the sum here of the

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,720
two functions is also differentiable and

36
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,879
the derivative is sum of the derivative.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,920
Another thing we had was that if you

38
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,560
take a constant times a function and

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,920
this function is differentiable then

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,400
this new function is also differentiable

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,319
and the derivative is that constant

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,160
times the derivative of the original

43
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,959
function.

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,440
And then the third thing was the

45
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,440
lightness rule

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
and that was if you take if you have

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
these two functions they're

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,080
differentiable

49
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,519
and you take the product and you take

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,519
the derivative that exists n is equal to

51
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,720
the derivative of the first times the

52
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,680
second plus the first time the

53
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,680
derivative of the

54
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,840
And then the fourth of these was the

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,840
quotient rule.

56
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,319
And the quotient rule was that you have

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,159
again these two functions. You assume

58
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,720
that g here is not equal to zero

59
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,799
uh at any point. And then you're looking

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,440
at the quotient here and the quotient is

61
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,239
also differentiable and the derivative

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,239
is given by this formula.

63
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,239
Um

64
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,239
this this is the formula for the

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
derivative where this is the function

66
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,360
multiplied by itself. Right? And then

67
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,120
there was a last rule

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,840
uh that was the chain rule.

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,840
So the chain rule

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,000
uh and that was that if you take a

71
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:21,919
function say from some interval into

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,600
some uh set uh let's call it uh let's

73
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,759
say that it's say that the interval that

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,520
the function is defined is some interval

75
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,840
from a to b and this function takes

76
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,840
value in another interval from C to D.

77
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,520
And then you have a function G that is

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,360
defined on C to D

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,440
into R.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,919
Then you can look at the composition,

81
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,800
right? You take some X and you first

82
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,000
apply F to it and then afterwards you

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,880
apply G. And this is typically written

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,880
as this.

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,400
And and the chain rule was that if f and

86
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,440
g are differentiable then this uh the

87
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,360
composition here is also differentiable

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,360
and the derivative of the composition

89
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,000
is the derivative of the second function

90
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,720
evaluated

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,720
at this point here

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,560
times the derivative of the first in

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,639
So this was the chain rule.

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,160
Okay, that was just a quick recap.

95
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,000
And now uh

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,000
the first thing we'll be interested in

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is if we have a so suppose

98
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,759
that f here is a function let's say

99
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:57,800
defined on some interval from a to b

100
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,800
into r and f is differentiable.

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,560
It doesn't need to be differentiable for

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,800
this here to make sense. But uh but we

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,919
say that x0

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,960
and x0 is now in

105
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,080
the open interval here. We say that uh

106
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,479
so we say

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,479
we say that

108
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,120
x0

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,360
um is so we say that

110
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,840
f

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:39,440
has a local maximum

112
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,440
has a local maximum

113
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,600
at x0.

114
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,600
If if there exist

115
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:03,039
[Applause]

116
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,919
exist delta greater than zero such that

117
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:11,280
if you restrict f and you just think

118
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:14,000
about f on this little interval

119
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,720
around x0.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,080
So you're forgetting about how f looks

121
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,560
like everywhere else. Then if you're

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,039
looking at the maximum

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
of this function. So this means that so

124
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:35,160
this is the same as just the maximum of

125
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,160
f on uh on this little interval

126
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,800
then the maximum

127
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:46,080
is achieved at x0. Right? If this is the

128
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,919
case, so you have the picture here. You

129
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,759
have a function. We talked about this a

130
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,440
little bit last time. You have a

131
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
function. Maybe the function looks like

132
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,120
this.

133
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,080
And this here point here is x0.

134
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,759
And so this here is the value at x0. And

135
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,800
you see that there's some little

136
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,800
interval. Say this interval here. If

137
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,039
you're looking at the function in this

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,800
little interval, then it's clear that

139
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,680
the maximum is is at x0, right? But of

140
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,080
course, it's just a local maximum. If

141
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
you were allowed to move further away

142
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,720
over here, you see that the value of the

143
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,440
function is much larger. Right? So this

144
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,599
is a local maximal. And for this to make

145
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,120
sense, you don't need the function to be

146
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,560
differentiable.

147
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,120
But we will when we apply it we will

148
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,919
assume that it is differentiable. So

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,479
this is a local maximum right and this

150
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,720
is sort of the picture right that is

151
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,200
it's it's just maximum near

152
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,000
uh if you're looking at at values near

153
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,080
x0 but it's not a global maximum. Of

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,640
course it could be a global maximum.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,640
And then similarly

156
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,640
for

157
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,640
a a local minimum

158
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
and I'll just draw a picture, you know,

159
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,959
because the definition is kind of

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,720
obvious. It's the same, right? That um

161
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,800
that you take a function here and and

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,880
you're looking at and so the function

163
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,880
maybe could look like this.

164
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,320
Right? And you see that if this here was

165
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,640
X0,

166
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
then in some little neighborhood around

167
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,279
X0,

168
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,839
this the value here would indeed be the

169
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,160
minimum, right? But if you're moving

170
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,560
much further away, then there might be

171
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,720
other points that are even small where

172
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,600
the value is even smaller, right? So

173
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,399
this is like a local minimum. And so the

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,320
the first observation you have about

175
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,320
this is the following lema.

176
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:10,839
If f here is a function say on an

177
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,839
interval like this is differentiable

178
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,120
uh and

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,240
has

180
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,240
a local

181
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
maximum

182
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,160
or minimum

183
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,720
local minimum

184
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,360
at x0. And now here if I'm thinking

185
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,240
about a function defined on a closed

186
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,279
interval like this, it's important that

187
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,600
where the local max or min is in an

188
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,040
interior point. It's not allowed to be

189
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,959
one of the boundary points.

190
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,959
So if it has a local if it is

191
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,399
differentiable and it has a local

192
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,120
maximum or minimum at such an interior

193
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,440
point then

194
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,440
then the claim is that then the

195
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,200
derivative

196
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:16,200
at x0 is is equal to zero.

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Okay.

198
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,079
And so now let's try to prove that.

199
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,880
[Applause]

200
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:30,360
So we have here right. So the picture is

201
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,360
let's just assume so uh prove

202
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,480
assume

203
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,640
that if

204
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,880
has a local

205
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,880
uh maximum

206
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,320
at x0 if it's a local minimum the

207
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,200
argument is is the same with obvious

208
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,880
modifications. Okay. So you have some

209
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,519
picture like this again here you have x0

210
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,959
and now this here is like the function

211
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,200
that oops maybe this so this is like the

212
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,120
function and we see that at the value

213
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,279
here at x0 it's maximum and then who

214
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,920
cares you know we don't care about what

215
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,360
happened when you are further away here

216
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,240
right and so you divide into two cases

217
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,839
you're looking at where x here is bigger

218
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
than x0

219
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:31,680
If x is bigger than x0 and now you're

220
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,399
looking at so then you have that f ofx

221
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,440
minus f of x0

222
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,440
right this the value here is maximum. So

223
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,639
this thing this value here is by it. So

224
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,120
if this is the case and

225
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,760
x is

226
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,760
sufficiently closed

227
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,760
close

228
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,000
to to x0 right if it's very close here

229
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,160
then it has a maximum at this point. So

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,079
this means that this difference here is

231
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,040
non-positive,

232
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,040
right?

233
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
This didn't really use that it was

234
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,639
strictly bigger than, right? It just

235
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,800
used that it was close to x0, right?

236
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,200
But but now this is where we're using

237
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,639
that it's bigger than because you also

238
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,639
have we also have

239
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,320
that x - x0 and again this is where this

240
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,120
assumption is used. This in here is

241
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,440
positive. Right?

242
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,920
So this means that if you take something

243
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,519
non-positive and you divide it by

244
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,040
something positive then the then what

245
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,880
you get is something that is nonpositive

246
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,639
right so this means that so this implies

247
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,240
that for the difference quotient f ofx

248
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,720
minus f of x0

249
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,199
x - x0

250
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
right again this here is non positive

251
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,880
this here is positive

252
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,519
which means that the whole thing is non

253
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,440
positive. Right? So as you are

254
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,079
approaching as you're going towards x0

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,760
from the right the difference quotient

256
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,560
here is non positive. Right? If you if

257
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,639
you now go to

258
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,920
x0 from the left if you go

259
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,839
if you go in this direction. So this

260
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,440
means that now you have x here is less

261
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,440
than x0 here right and sufficiently

262
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,440
close.

263
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,600
So if you have that then uh well you you

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,399
again have this was just because it was

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,560
a local maximum. You still have that

266
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:09,959
this thing here is not positive.

267
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,959
But now you have that now now we have

268
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,800
that x minus x0

269
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,880
right this thing here now is be right

270
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,199
because of this this means that this

271
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,839
thing here strictly lessens right. So

272
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,639
you take something that is non-positive

273
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
and you divide it by something negative

274
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,040
then you get something non- negative

275
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,560
right. So therefore this implies that

276
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,880
for the difference quotient f ofx minus

277
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,880
f of x0 for the difference quotient here

278
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,360
you get that this thing here this is

279
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,880
nonpositive this is negative this means

280
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:57,959
that this here is non negative right so

281
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,959
as you're coming in so you see that

282
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,040
that as you're approaching in this this

283
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,199
direction to x0 then the difference

284
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,000
quotient is non positive. When you're

285
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,199
coming in here, it's non- negative, but

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,079
it has a limit. And so the limit from

287
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,240
this side would have to be right. This

288
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,720
is the limit from this side would have

289
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,560
to be non-positive. And the limit from

290
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,279
this one non- negative. So therefore the

291
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,480
limit must be zero. Right? So we

292
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,040
conclude that the limit here So we

293
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,519
conclude that the limit

294
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,600
hence

295
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:41,120
uh the limit here as x goes to x0 of f

296
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,680
ofx of the different function

297
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,680
must be zero.

298
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:52,079
And so this is the derivative

299
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,959
at that point. And similarly if it was a

300
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,519
local minimum. Okay.

301
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,639
now

302
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,480
and and a point where and a point where

303
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:09,120
the derivative

304
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:12,120
um so maybe I'll just say that um so so

305
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,120
if

306
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:26,319
if um fprime at x0 is equal to zero then

307
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:26,319
we often say that then x0 is set to be

308
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,960
a critical point

309
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,080
for for for f. Okay. And let me just

310
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,880
give you an example. So I mean let me

311
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,160
give you three two examples.

312
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,880
So suppose you take f ofx

313
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,360
= to x2. Right? This here is a polomial.

314
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,360
We know how to compute the derivative of

315
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,600
any polomial. This is just using the

316
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,200
lightness rule. And I mean using these

317
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,600
rules in this case you would only need

318
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,799
the lightness rule together with we know

319
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,000
what the derivative of of the function f

320
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,960
ofx = to x is. So in this case the

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,280
derivative of this here

322
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,840
is 2x.

323
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:23,240
And so this means that x = z is a

324
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,240
critical point.

325
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,960
It's actually the only critical point

326
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,960
and so you see in this case this is how

327
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,280
the function look like right this is

328
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
sort of how the function look like here

329
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,679
you have zero

330
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,000
right

331
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:48,240
another example is that if you take the

332
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,400
another polomium uh where it's instead

333
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:56,240
of x to the^ 2 it's x ^ three, then the

334
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,880
derivative of of of this function is

335
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:04,559
3x^2,

336
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:06,559
right? And so you see again that x = 0

337
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,679
is a critical point. The derivative here

338
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,400
if you plug in zero gets zero. So this

339
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,400
is a critical point.

340
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,160
But in this case, in this case the the

341
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,799
the

342
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,320
graph of the function for this example

343
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,559
here the graph looks like it looks like

344
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,679
something like this

345
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,880
becomes very flat here like this. Okay.

346
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,960
And so you see that so zero is a

347
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,640
critical point but it's not like it has

348
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:48,880
a local maximum minimum. Okay. And and

349
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,880
it's this Yeah.

350
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,280
Okay. So the next thing I want to do is

351
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:02,240
I want to now apply it uh I want to

352
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:05,280
apply this symbol observation uh and uh

353
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,039
uh I want to apply it in to get a

354
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,120
consequence

355
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,000
simple consequence and then I want to

356
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,640
apply that simple consequence to get a

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,640
lot of other consequences.

358
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:26,000
So the first thing I want to do is

359
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:29,000
what's called roles lema theorem.

360
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So,

361
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,520
so we have uh

362
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,159
so this is the following

363
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,840
that I have a function f

364
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:55,080
from uh a to b

365
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,080
uh into

366
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,919
uh R

367
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,919
and I'm assuming that F is

368
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,919
differentiable

369
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,080
and I'm also assuming that the value

370
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,280
initially

371
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,600
and the value at the end

372
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,840
that those two values are the same.

373
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,559
Sometimes one set those value equal to

374
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,400
zero but it's just they just need to be

375
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,200
the same. Um and then the claim is that

376
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,440
then

377
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,440
there exist

378
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,159
uh x0

379
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:47,120
where

380
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,640
x0 is strictly between a and b

381
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,360
and

382
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,360
the derivative

383
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,200
at this x0

384
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,240
is equal to zero. Okay.

385
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,200
And so the idea is just very simple that

386
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,240
you have

387
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,240
you have uh

388
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:20,159
you have a function

389
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:23,760
and the function initially this is at a

390
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,960
here you have b the function initially

391
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,960
and at the end end up at the same value.

392
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,400
So this here is right. So this is

393
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,880
this here is f a and that's the same as

394
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,880
f of b

395
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,640
and then who knows what happened in

396
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,159
between

397
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,640
maybe like this and the claim is that

398
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,559
then there's always some point where the

399
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,840
derivative is zero. In this case it

400
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,440
looks like that those two would be the

401
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,960
point right where the derivative was

402
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,159
zero.

403
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:06,840
And the proof is just this. So prove

404
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,840
that there's three cases to consider

405
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,880
to consider

406
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,880
one is I mean you don't really have to

407
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,440
divide it up by list but let me divide

408
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,000
it up into these three cases. One is

409
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:29,039
that the function here is constant.

410
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,360
It's everywhere equal to the same.

411
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,240
Right? Well, if the function is

412
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,960
constant, then the derivative is zero.

413
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,880
Right? We have already proven that. Case

414
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,200
two

415
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,200
there exist

416
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:54,640
uh somewhere there exist x such that

417
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:59,159
the value at this x is strictly bigger

418
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,159
than the value at the end points.

419
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,720
And then case three,

420
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:11,200
uh, there exists an x such that the

421
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:15,279
value at this x is strictly less than

422
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,679
the values at the input.

423
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,159
Right? It's clear that one of these

424
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,039
three cases happen, right? I mean, of

425
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,520
course, it could be that case two and

426
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,440
three could have both happen, right? But

427
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,600
at least one of the three cases would

428
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,760
happen, right?

429
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,799
In case one, we already know that the

430
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,960
derivative is zero everywhere. So let's

431
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,400
just look at case two. Case three is

432
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,840
similar, right? So if there exists some

433
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,039
x where the value so in this picture

434
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,760
here, this here is maybe x the value

435
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,919
here is larger than at the two end

436
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,880
points, right?

437
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,039
Well, by the extreme value theorem right

438
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,720
that we proved earlier just because if a

439
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,600
function is differentiable it's also

440
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,559
continuous by the extreme value theorem

441
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:09,120
there exists somewhere where actually

442
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:11,600
the maximum is achieved right and since

443
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,559
somewhere in between in in this case

444
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:19,360
here the maximum is the maximum is not

445
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,640
achieved at the two end points right so

446
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,159
the maximum must be achieved at at an

447
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,240
interior point, right?

448
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,720
But now it's it's not just a local

449
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,960
maximum. It actually is a a maximum. But

450
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,120
already if it was a local maximum, the

451
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,919
derivative would be zero at that point.

452
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,760
Right? So this proved case two and case

453
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,919
three is is similar. Right? So this is

454
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,279
ro theorem.

455
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,679
Okay? Now Bless theorem have then a

456
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,880
bunch of applications

457
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,600
and the first one is to uh what's called

458
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,600
the mean value theorem

459
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,200
and there are two versions of the mean

460
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,720
value theorem.

461
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,120
one is is the active mean value theorem

462
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,400
and the other is like a fancy version of

463
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,480
it which where you have two functions in

464
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,840
play at the same time and that's called

465
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,480
the cushib value the

466
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,840
so so

467
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,840
consequence for first consequence

468
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,600
of the

469
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,600
uh and this is the mean value the

470
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,520
okay and so the first one is the the

471
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,520
actual mean value theorem

472
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:03,000
and then actually Meanwhile, theorem say

473
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,000
that if we take a function uh f

474
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:11,559
from a to b on some interval like this

475
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,559
that and the function is differentiable.

476
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,520
Then uh then there exist a x

477
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,240
X strictly there exist X where X is

478
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,520
strictly between A and B

479
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,840
and so that the derivative

480
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,400
at X is equal to the difference quotion

481
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,000
where you do the difference quotient at

482
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:56,000
the at the two end points.

483
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,640
So this here is this this side of it

484
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,440
that's what you often call the mean and

485
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,279
the mean is equal to the derivative at

486
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,840
some intermediate points. This is what

487
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,559
they say. Okay.

488
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,520
And so now

489
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:15,120
right so this seems a lot better than

490
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,440
the uh but it's an easy consequence of

491
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,360
the

492
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,360
because if you look at so

493
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:33,480
So if you look at

494
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,480
suppose you take the function. So pro

495
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,640
suppose you take the function

496
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,360
uh h of x

497
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:50,760
equal to f ofx

498
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,760
minus uh f of b minus f of a.

499
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:00,320
divided by uh x uh sorry divided by b

500
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:04,080
minus a * x - a suppose you're looking

501
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,600
at this function here h right

502
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,080
then observe first that so this one this

503
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,919
function is differentiable this is just

504
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,840
a constant

505
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,960
right this is just a linear function

506
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,799
right this is a is a constant also So

507
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,120
this is differentiable. This is a

508
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,640
constant. This is differentiable. And

509
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,240
we're subtracting it from a

510
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,240
differentiable function. So h is

511
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,240
differentiable.

512
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:39,600
Uh h of a is f of a, right? And then

513
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,600
this thing here minus f of b minus f of

514
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,960
a

515
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:49,520
b minus a. And then this here is a minus

516
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,480
a. So this is zero. So this is f of a

517
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,679
h of b

518
00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:01,039
is f of b

519
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:05,440
minus and then f of b minus f of a

520
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:08,960
b minus a. And here you plug in b. So b

521
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,480
minus a. And so you see that this here

522
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,360
these here cancel out

523
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,399
and you are right. So you are

524
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,480
subtracting this but this is a minus

525
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:25,440
minus so you're adding so this is f of a

526
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,440
right so you see that for this function

527
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,200
it's the value at a and b are the same

528
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,919
right

529
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,919
so so now we apply Water is still.

530
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,960
So now we have bibles.

531
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,279
by them applied to

532
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,799
to to h, right? Then we have that um

533
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,760
that h

534
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,679
is equal to zero. The derivative of h is

535
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,679
equal to zero for some x

536
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,559
where

537
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,320
X is strictly between A and B. Right?

538
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:39,120
This is R theorem. This because this

539
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:43,600
function H has the same value at A as at

540
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:50,159
B. Right? Now, what is the derivative of

541
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:54,000
H? Uh h H. Yeah. So the derivative of H

542
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,080
is the derivative of F.

543
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,480
And this is just again this is just a

544
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:05,440
constant. So we have to keep that minus

545
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:09,760
f of b minus f of a

546
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,279
b b minus a and then u the derivative.

547
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,840
So this just a constant and then

548
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,640
derivative of this is just one. So this

549
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,200
here is what the derivative is. And so

550
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,440
you see that so we have this x where

551
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,399
this the derivative is zero. So this

552
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,559
here is zero.

553
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,679
But if this here is zero, it means that

554
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,320
this thing here is equal to that. Right?

555
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,000
And so that was the mean value theorem.

556
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,760
So let's prove the mean value theorem.

557
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,720
Okay?

558
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,679
There's a second mean theorem and the

559
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,679
second one is the Kushim

560
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:55,320
and so this is a little more fancy.

561
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Uh so the cushiming I assume.

562
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,200
So this is the following

563
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,559
that you have two functions uh f and g.

564
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,640
So we have f g

565
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,600
on some interval

566
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:26,279
from a to b

567
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,279
into r and they are both differentiable.

568
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:43,600
um they're both differentiable

569
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:46,919
and then the claim is that there exist

570
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,919
there exist

571
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,559
uh there exist uh x let's call it x0 uh

572
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,559
maybe I should have called it x0 up

573
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,320
there just two just one exist x0

574
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,600
with

575
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:10,800
x0 strictly between a and E

576
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:14,159
and and um okay and so that it's

577
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,040
something about that the derivative of

578
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,679
the both functions kind of behave like

579
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,560
the mean value theorem at the same time.

580
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,520
Okay. So it is that the derivative

581
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:33,359
I I will explain this in in a second

582
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:39,599
that the derivative at this point times

583
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:43,599
uh g of b minus g of a

584
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,320
is equal to the derivative of

585
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:52,240
of g at x0

586
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:54,159
f of b minus f of a

587
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,680
okay

588
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,920
so this is the this is the kushi uh mean

589
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,960
theorem okay so say that for this

590
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,240
And let's let's just look at that

591
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,960
expression here before we prove it.

592
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,960
in your thumb.

593
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,960
So

594
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:22,040
if you had if if now so as a consequence

595
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,040
so observe

596
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,680
that if

597
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,560
uh g of b

598
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:37,400
is not equal for

599
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,400
to uh g of a

600
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,280
and

601
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,200
g prime

602
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,320
at x0

603
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,320
is not equal to zero.

604
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:59,200
If you have that then you could divide

605
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,240
you could have this expression let's say

606
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,640
that um then you would by just dividing

607
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,680
this here on both sides and this here on

608
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:13,920
both sides you would get that fprime of

609
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:19,119
x0 divided by g prime at x0 is equal to

610
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:27,079
f of b minus f of a

611
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:27,079
uh G of B minus G of A.

612
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:35,680
Okay, you would have that. Right?

613
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:41,760
Now, I could think about this thing here

614
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:46,320
as f of B minus F of A

615
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,040
divided by uh B minus A.

616
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,960
So, I could think about it like this.

617
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:57,839
and then times b minus a

618
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:01,520
g of b minus g of a.

619
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:04,320
Okay. And so you see that this here it's

620
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,400
something about right the actual mean

621
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,040
value theorem say that this thing here

622
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,160
that there would be some point x0 in

623
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,760
between that was equal to this right

624
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,599
that would be the mean value theorem

625
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,640
applied to f right and the meani term

626
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:25,680
applied to g would be that there exist

627
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:29,520
some x0 so that one over this is equal

628
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,599
to this thing here Right? And the Kushi

629
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,000
Min theorem say that you can kind of

630
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,240
arrange so that both of these things

631
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,920
happen at the same time. Okay.

632
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,440
So, so this seems actually pretty good,

633
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,960
right? I mean, you can do it at the same

634
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,359
time. It's a little bit surprising in a

635
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,359
way, but but the proof is is quite

636
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,800
trivial.

637
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,440
Uh so, but it's it's useful. So the

638
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,440
proof is the following

639
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,560
that you just look right. So this is

640
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,720
what we want to prove right. So you just

641
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:10,000
define so you just and the x0 is

642
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,079
unknown. So if I if I take this

643
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,160
expression that I want to prove if I

644
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,400
move this thing here over on the other

645
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,400
side right then I would get then I would

646
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,359
get so I would define in this case I

647
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:33,520
would define f of h of x to be f

648
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:37,359
of x g b minus g a minus

649
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:41,760
uh g of x

650
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:44,800
um fb minus fa.

651
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,560
So I would define it like this. And you

652
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,359
see that when you now take the

653
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,359
derivative of h,

654
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,720
you just get this here,

655
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,040
right? This is because everything else

656
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,160
is constant.

657
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,560
So this is what you get right and you

658
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:18,599
want to find a x0

659
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,599
where you want to find so want to find

660
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,760
x0 where this thing here

661
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,400
is zero right to find such a x0 is the

662
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,720
same as saying that you have find an x0

663
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,480
over here right

664
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,640
now

665
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,280
so now let's see what What is the value

666
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:44,720
of h at a?

667
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:51,040
If you plug in a here, then you get uh f

668
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:54,320
of a g of b minus g of a

669
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:59,040
minus g of a

670
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:04,079
f of b minus f of a.

671
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:08,720
Okay. And so now you see that the here I

672
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:14,640
have f uh sorry I have uh this one here

673
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:17,599
this one here I have f of a times g of a

674
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,720
that comes with a minus sign I have the

675
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,640
same term over here but that comes with

676
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:28,720
a plus so those two cancel out so I'm

677
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:33,760
just get f of a

678
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:36,079
g of B minus G of A

679
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,520
F of B.

680
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:45,280
So that's what I get there.

681
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:49,520
And now I look at H of B.

682
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,839
So if I plug in B up here for X, then

683
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,240
I'm getting

684
00:40:51,839 --> 00:41:01,040
then I get uh F of B

685
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:05,119
g of B minus G of A

686
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:09,839
minus G of B

687
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:12,560
F of B minus F of A.

688
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:15,599
Okay.

689
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,480
And now you see that this when you

690
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,520
multiply this by this

691
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,079
that term f of b g of b you have this

692
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,119
over here also but it comes with a minus

693
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,520
sign. So those cancel out and so you're

694
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,240
getting a term this the only term that

695
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,280
lives is this one times that so minus g

696
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:41,680
of a f of b and then you get this term

697
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,240
minus min - or plus g of b

698
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,240
f of a

699
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,240
and

700
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,880
right that's right and now you see that

701
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,880
this is the same as that and the these

702
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,079
two here

703
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,280
uh are the same. Right?

704
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:09,200
So you see that so we conclude here from

705
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:13,280
this we conclude that h of a is equal to

706
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,680
h of b right so again it's satisfying

707
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,839
the requirements of roller theorem and

708
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,640
so there is this intermediate point

709
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,160
where the derivative was zero but we've

710
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,240
but if the derivative of h is zero

711
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,599
that's exactly the kind the point we

712
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,440
wanted to find right where you have this

713
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,760
Okay.

714
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,599
And so so again, you know, the kushi mim

715
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,079
is sort of a stronger statement,

716
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,000
but it's just it's a it's a stronger

717
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,599
statement because it's like it allow you

718
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,960
to have two functions and then you uh

719
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,640
know this point where sort of the to

720
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,680
some extent the mean value for both

721
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,000
functions are satisfied. Right? That's

722
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,200
the idea.

723
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,599
uh and but it's an example of where

724
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,720
actually the proof

725
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,520
it in fact worked more generally than

726
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,560
than than what you used it for initially

727
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,240
to and the initially you just use it for

728
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,640
a single function right to prove the

729
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,880
mean math theorem.

730
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,599
Okay.

731
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:27,119
Now uh so now we want to prove so now we

732
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:32,800
have a number of consequences of this

733
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:35,800
um and um and the first one

734
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,800
um

735
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,920
let me that

736
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,960
let me start with um

737
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:03,440
with another consequence of polytherm

738
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:07,359
and then I come back to the kushid meth

739
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,359
so tail taylor expansion

740
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,400
So the idea here is that you have a

741
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:21,520
function uh f

742
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,480
um and you have a function

743
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,880
um let's say let's say that it's a

744
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:33,280
function on r doesn't need to be defined

745
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:36,000
on all of r into r and uh f

746
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:41,079
uh I'm assuming so Let me do a special

747
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,079
case of this. So a special case first.

748
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:54,359
So I assume I have a function like this

749
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,359
and uh that is differentiable

750
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,440
and then I'm assuming that the

751
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,880
derivative so the derivative is our

752
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,280
function from R into R and I'm assuming

753
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,680
that the derivative is also

754
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,680
differentiable.

755
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,880
And the idea is now that I'm looking at

756
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,520
the function and the idea is so the idea

757
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,119
is like this again in a minute I'll

758
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,240
prove a more general statement but I

759
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:37,520
just prove this one first to make the

760
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,720
idea clear. So the idea is that you want

761
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,720
to say

762
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,040
that

763
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,040
f locally

764
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,920
can be

765
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,920
approximated

766
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,640
by a polinomial.

767
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,240
So that's the idea of the tail

768
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,800
expansion. Okay, that that if you if you

769
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,520
take a function

770
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,440
that's if you take a function like this

771
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,240
some function and you take a point then

772
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,720
in a neighborhood let's say that this is

773
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,280
some point here x0 then in a

774
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,720
neighborhood of this point

775
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:33,119
instead of looking at the function you

776
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,359
get you could get a very good idea about

777
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,839
how the function behave in this small

778
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,560
neighborhood if you look at a certain

779
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,119
polomial. Okay? And the higher degree

780
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,839
the polomial, the better the

781
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,240
approximation is to the function. And so

782
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,880
we'll just do a simple version of this

783
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,240
first

784
00:46:50,880 --> 00:47:01,359
where you're looking at the

785
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:03,520
so in this case I would look at the so

786
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:09,280
so I have

787
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:14,319
um so I so we have f here

788
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:19,160
and I'm interested in in in uh in f so

789
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:19,160
we will be interested in f near

790
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,920
x0

791
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,720
and then you're looking at what's called

792
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,720
the tailor polom

793
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,359
at x0. Okay. And the tail polom it

794
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,079
depends on how many times you're willing

795
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,880
to take the derivative. And so in this

796
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,040
case I just look at the first tail

797
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,920
polinomial.

798
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,480
So this here is and now it is the tail

799
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,240
polomial at x0.

800
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:02,640
So this thing here is by definition the

801
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:05,599
value of f at x0 plus

802
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,000
uh and then the derivative

803
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,599
of f at x0

804
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,400
x - x0.

805
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,839
So this here is the first order tailor

806
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:22,559
expansion. So it's this here would be is

807
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:25,960
often often called the first order

808
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,960
tail expansions

809
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,079
expansion

810
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,559
addiction.

811
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Okay.

812
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,599
Now the what you're interested in is

813
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:48,000
you're interested in showing that this

814
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:51,640
one this polomium here. So, so the again

815
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,640
the idea is

816
00:48:52,480 --> 00:49:03,280
that uh that f ofx

817
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:05,440
should be almost equal to p1 of x if

818
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,760
x0 here

819
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:12,559
sorry if x is almost equal to x0 right

820
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,520
so near x0

821
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,520
the function is very well approximated

822
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:22,640
by in this case this linear function.

823
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:25,280
Okay. And so now but you want to so now

824
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:29,119
the key here is

825
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,119
is what is uh

826
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,720
how do you estimate

827
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:38,559
how well it approximates? Okay. And so

828
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:42,319
the thing is that

829
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:45,920
that um so so the statement is then that

830
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:49,920
so you have here x0

831
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,520
you have here x and the claim is now

832
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:58,359
that there exist there exist

833
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,359
some c between

834
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,520
uh x0

835
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:09,119
and x strictly between So between which

836
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:12,839
means that it's strictly between

837
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,839
let me just write that

838
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,400
X could also lie on the other sides

839
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,920
right then I you know it's sort of

840
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,599
obvious what I mean strictly between

841
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,119
also

842
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:34,800
so there exists some X some C in between

843
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:37,520
these two so that uh f of x is equal to

844
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:42,400
this tailor polinomial

845
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:45,680
plus and then um uh the second

846
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,000
derivative. So this is the derivative of

847
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:53,440
the derivative.

848
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,359
This is so so f2 here is the derivative

849
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,760
and then you take the derivative like

850
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,720
that

851
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:05,839
and that is evaluated at c and then

852
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:07,920
divided by two and then it's x uh minus

853
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,240
x0

854
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,240
square

855
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,760
okay

856
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,559
and in a minute I would just do the

857
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,559
general case of

858
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:35,000
Okay. So this is this is the

859
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
um

860
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:43,480
right and so now

861
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,480
how do you prove this?

862
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,760
So

863
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,800
what you do is so let's try to prove

864
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,800
this. So

865
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,559
So I define a M. We define a M.

866
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:25,000
m is just some real number

867
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:25,000
and it's defined so that um f of x

868
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,280
uh I wonder if I should in my notes here

869
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,920
in my notes I call it just because I

870
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,599
thought it was clear and maybe I will do

871
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:47,359
this here also I call this point here A

872
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:49,839
and this here B and then C here is

873
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:53,520
somewhere in between. Right? So this

874
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:58,960
means that this thing here is B and this

875
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:01,440
here is B and this here is is then B and

876
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:05,280
this here is A.

877
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:08,240
Okay, it's just to be clear that somehow

878
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,119
you know you're kind of fixing X, right?

879
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:18,079
Okay.

880
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:20,640
Now, so to prove it, so I we look at

881
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:26,680
this thing here

882
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,680
and you uh you look at

883
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,440
this thing here and you define uh and we

884
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:41,040
subtract

885
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:44,400
P1 of B and then we uh define M. So that

886
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:49,520
you have that this thing here

887
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:51,760
uh is b minus a squared right. So, so

888
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,119
define M

889
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:58,400
by this thing here, right? This here

890
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,720
just gives you some number.

891
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,400
A and B are difference. So, this is non

892
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:07,920
zero. So, this here so M is just given

893
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,319
by that is this difference here divided

894
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:14,000
by this here

895
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:17,839
times two. Right?

896
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:22,960
So, that's how we defined M.

897
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:25,040
And but now we want to show need to show

898
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,839
right so like M is like in if you do it

899
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,839
like this it's like M is okay it's just

900
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,839
by definition

901
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:39,480
the you have so so now we have by so so

902
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:39,480
so we have by definition we have

903
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:55,599
we have that uh f of b again is equal to

904
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:57,200
p1 1 of B uh + M 2 B minus A square.

905
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:01,000
Okay.

906
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,000
But we need to prove

907
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:11,119
we need to show

908
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,599
that M here is the second derivative of

909
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,280
the original function at some

910
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:19,480
intermediate point. Right? That's what

911
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,480
we need to prove. Right.

912
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:27,480
And so you're looking at at um

913
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:42,160
you're looking at. So now we're looking

914
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:46,599
at the function h ofx

915
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,599
equal to f ofx

916
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:58,880
minus p1 of x - m / 2 x - a 2. Right? So

917
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:02,319
if we're looking at this function,

918
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:06,880
well if we're looking at h of let let me

919
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:10,559
do b first. So if I do B then this here

920
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:19,680
is F of B

921
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:23,839
minus P1 of B minus M / 2 B - A^ 2 but M

922
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:27,920
was defined so that this thing here is

923
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:33,240
equal to that. So by definition this is

924
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,240
by by definition of M

925
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:42,079
I have that this thing here. So,

926
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:49,400
right.

927
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:49,400
If I'm now looking at h of of a

928
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,920
well this thing here, here you get f of

929
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,000
a.

930
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,720
Here you get minus p1 of a. If you plug

931
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,680
in a here then this is zero. So you get

932
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:12,319
so this is what you get right. But

933
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:14,960
remember how P1 was given P1 was here

934
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:18,680
right and we now do it at A. So this

935
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,680
here is really A.

936
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,880
Okay. So you see that when you plug in X

937
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:29,040
here this thing here is zero. So you

938
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:34,640
just get f of a here. So this thing here

939
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:36,400
is is f of a minus f of a. So that's

940
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,559
zero.

941
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,040
Right?

942
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:45,760
So you see that if you're looking at

943
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:52,359
this function here then at a it's zero

944
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,359
at b it's zero. So, pyrolysis pyosium.

945
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:06,480
Uh they exist they exist

946
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:10,200
uh C1

947
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,200
with between

948
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,359
A and B

949
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:24,960
such that

950
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:26,720
H prime of C is is equal to zero. Okay.

951
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,119
Now,

952
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,319
that's not the that's not the sorry,

953
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,000
this is the C1, right? It's not the C we

954
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,680
want we're looking for, right? The C

955
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,240
we're looking for is something where the

956
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,160
second derivative is something, right?

957
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:45,280
But now you see that now you have this

958
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:49,680
function H and here you have a,

959
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:52,480
here you have C1 and then you have B is

960
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,280
further away like this. And you have

961
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:59,760
that the derivative in this case the

962
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:02,160
derivative is zero at at a and the

963
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,680
derivative

964
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:08,960
uh sorry not the derivative not at at a

965
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:11,359
but the derivative at this point here h

966
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,920
prime

967
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:18,000
is equals to zero. Let's calculate what

968
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:20,160
the derivative of h is at a. Right? I

969
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,400
want to apply the RERS theorem a second

970
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,040
time. But in order to apply Roers

971
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:29,119
theorem a second time,

972
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:32,079
I really need the derivative of h at a

973
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:35,400
to be zero. But let's see what it's

974
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,400
equal to.

975
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:42,319
And so again,

976
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:46,640
we have h up there at the top.

977
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:51,200
And so this means that h prime

978
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:53,440
is equal to fprime minus and then the

979
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,000
tailor polomium here was a tailor

980
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,240
polomium. This is just when you take

981
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,760
derivative this is just a constant

982
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,559
you're getting frime

983
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,520
a right this is all it gives you when

984
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:11,599
you take the derivative of this here.

985
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:13,920
Um and then uh you're getting minus and

986
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,000
you're getting m

987
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,799
x - a. That's when you take the

988
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,280
derivative of the last term. Okay. So

989
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:24,280
this is what you get and this here is at

990
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,280
x.

991
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:35,359
But so now h prime at a

992
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,440
this is frime at a minus frime at a this

993
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,319
thing here is actually zero.

994
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,440
So you see that this whole thing is zero

995
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:47,760
right? So we have what we have is that

996
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:51,119
we have that h prime at c1 is zero and

997
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,680
this is also equal to the derivative of

998
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,400
a right.

999
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:01,960
So we can apply what is them a second

1000
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,960
time right? So by applying water sim

1001
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,880
a second time

1002
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,000
uh we have

1003
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:28,000
a C2 and now this C2 that's really going

1004
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:30,000
to be our C in this case. Uh so we have

1005
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,480
a second

1006
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,240
uh C

1007
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:39,680
where the derivative of the derivative

1008
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:45,520
so the second derivative of H

1009
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:48,559
at that point is equal to zero. Okay.

1010
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,640
And this one here, remember this here is

1011
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:54,319
when you apply roer theorem, you started

1012
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:57,440
with A, you had here B, then you got C1

1013
01:01:54,319 --> 01:02:00,799
that was between these two, that was C1.

1014
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,520
But now you're looking at H prime in

1015
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:05,440
this interval. And so the second one is

1016
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,880
lying here,

1017
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,359
right? So it's it's certainly between A

1018
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,799
and B, but it's actually even between A

1019
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:17,680
and C1. Right? Now what does this here

1020
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:21,040
means? Right? So we hope that this is

1021
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:26,040
the one the point we're looking for. And

1022
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,040
so to calculate the second derivative

1023
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:39,040
you to calculate the second derivative.

1024
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:42,720
So this here uh this here was the

1025
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:45,920
derivative of h. So we just need to take

1026
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:52,960
another derivative of h. So if we do

1027
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:57,040
this then uh we get that so hp prime of

1028
01:02:52,960 --> 01:03:00,559
x at some x is equal to f double prime

1029
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:03,680
at x and then you see this thing here

1030
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,280
this is just a constant this is a linear

1031
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,240
functions the derivative of this one

1032
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,920
here is one so you're getting this minus

1033
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,920
m

1034
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:16,640
right and now we know that hp prime at

1035
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:21,039
this intermediate point C2 which we also

1036
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:25,200
call C that's equal to zero. So this

1037
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:28,079
means that FP prime at the C minus M is

1038
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:32,359
equal to zero. So this means that M

1039
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,359
really was the second derivative

1040
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:40,880
of F at this point, right? Okay. So

1041
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:43,839
she's proves sort of clever that you

1042
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:47,359
you know it's you know it's but if you

1043
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:50,880
the proof seems very clever but if you

1044
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:52,960
think about it um

1045
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,079
I mean it's so it's applying royers

1046
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:00,799
theorem twice but it's sort of in a way

1047
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:04,319
the only thing it could be but anyway

1048
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:06,720
okay so that was uh so that was Taylor

1049
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:09,039
this was just a special case of tail

1050
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:13,440
expansion. Let me state the general

1051
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:15,599
case. So the general case is so so

1052
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,480
right. So in in for to proving the

1053
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,200
special case we applied roy theorem

1054
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,960
twice but you can actually apply roy

1055
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:28,319
theorem like k times and so if you apply

1056
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,720
it k times then you're getting the kt

1057
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:33,920
tail expansion.

1058
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:36,640
So, so this here is the the general case

1059
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:40,280
of the tail expansion.

1060
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,280
So, general case

1061
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,680
of tail expansion.

1062
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,799
So the general case is that you take a

1063
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:03,319
function

1064
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:03,319
on R into R. You assume assume

1065
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:09,720
that f is differentiable

1066
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:20,079
but also that f prime is differentiable

1067
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:23,920
and all the way up to say f the k the k

1068
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:26,880
uh by you you assume that that that it's

1069
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:30,880
differentiable and all the way up to the

1070
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:36,119
k minus one derivative is also

1071
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,119
differentiable. So this here exist

1072
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,960
right? So all of these exist all these

1073
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,680
derivative exist.

1074
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:47,200
And then the claim is that so now the

1075
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:50,680
tailor polomium the k

1076
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,680
taylor polinomial

1077
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,079
or some

1078
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:03,720
or or if you or sometimes called the uh

1079
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,720
tailum

1080
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,839
uh of the

1081
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:23,720
uh uh uh k minus one

1082
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:23,720
is that you're looking at

1083
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,440
so this sorry this here should be the k

1084
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,440
minus one tail for

1085
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:40,799
so this is where you write so you take

1086
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:46,240
again

1087
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:48,559
You have here A and you have B.

1088
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,200
Let me write it with A and B instead of

1089
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,440
with X, you know, because I think it's a

1090
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,640
little clearer. So, so the thing is that

1091
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:02,400
the polomium is where you say you expand

1092
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:06,400
around um a and so the polomium

1093
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:08,400
this is the k minus one polomium

1094
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:14,319
there that for that we write it in terms

1095
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:19,039
of x and this is the polomium where the

1096
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:24,079
constant term is the value of f at a

1097
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:28,559
the um The derivative, the coefficient

1098
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:31,200
to the first order term is frime at a

1099
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:34,319
and then x - a.

1100
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:36,799
The coefficient to the second is the

1101
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:41,760
second derivative at a and now it's

1102
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:46,720
divided by 2 x - a squared. And then

1103
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:51,760
it's this next one is f triple prime.

1104
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:56,000
And now it's really 3 * 2 * 1

1105
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:59,599
* x - a to the^ 3.

1106
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,680
And then you continue like this

1107
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:06,559
up to the k minus one derivative.

1108
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,400
And then it's k -1

1109
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:13,119
factorial

1110
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:17,199
x - a k minus one.

1111
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:19,679
So this is this is the k minus one ton.

1112
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:22,080
Okay. And so you observe that you can

1113
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:26,640
just write it. So it's typically written

1114
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:29,120
like this that f the k d the i

1115
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:33,920
derivative

1116
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:38,799
in a divided by i factorial

1117
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:43,759
x - a to the power i. and I is now

1118
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:47,839
summing from uh from zero

1119
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:52,679
to to uh k minus one.

1120
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:52,679
This is by definition equal to that.

1121
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:59,600
Okay. So that's a tailor polinomial the

1122
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:01,920
the k minus one tailor polomium. And now

1123
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,159
the tailor the general case of the

1124
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,040
tailor expansion

1125
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:08,880
is then

1126
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:14,839
so the general case of the tailor

1127
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,839
expansion is then that

1128
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:25,199
that's um so

1129
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:27,920
so this is like the third

1130
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,920
cell expansion.

1131
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:40,319
So you have again this function on R

1132
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:42,480
into R and you have that all of the

1133
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:45,520
derivative

1134
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:47,520
up to and including the K derivative

1135
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:52,799
they all exist

1136
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:58,159
and then you have that uh F of B is

1137
01:09:52,799 --> 01:10:00,000
equal to the K minus one tailor polomial

1138
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:02,960
at B

1139
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,520
plus and then the this is this term is

1140
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,000
usually called the remainder term and

1141
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:11,360
the rema and the key point here is that

1142
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,719
it's easy to estimate to estimate the

1143
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,199
remainder term because there's an

1144
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:19,840
expression for it this is the k

1145
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:22,719
derivative of f in this point that is an

1146
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,640
intermediate point divided by k

1147
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,199
factorial

1148
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:33,679
uh C minus

1149
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:38,480
uh sorry uh B minus uh A to the power K,

1150
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:43,840
right? And and where where where

1151
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:46,840
C here is lying between A and B.

1152
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,840
Okay.

1153
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:52,800
Right. And and again the idea is that

1154
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,560
you take you have a function any

1155
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,679
function

1156
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:01,600
it needs to be differentiable

1157
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:05,520
k times but then actually it's very

1158
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:09,199
close to a a polomium of degree k minus

1159
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:13,760
one and you can estimate it how close it

1160
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:16,640
is in terms of this term here

1161
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,280
and so the proof of this right so the

1162
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,199
proof It's really just what we did. But

1163
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,800
let's just go over it again. You know,

1164
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:27,920
we only did the first uh where we did it

1165
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:33,320
in a case where K was equal to two. And

1166
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,320
now let me try to do this in general.

1167
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:48,159
So you're looking at f of b minus right

1168
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,640
we have this tail polomial k minus one

1169
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:52,800
tail polomium

1170
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,800
um

1171
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:59,280
um and you're looking at you define so

1172
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:04,520
define

1173
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:04,520
m by the equation

1174
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:17,440
that this here is m / k factorial

1175
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:22,800
* uh b minus a to the power k.

1176
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:26,080
So this here is how right u m is defined

1177
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,400
right b is not equal to m. So this is

1178
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,480
just some positive some whatever some

1179
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,679
yeah it's actually a positive constant

1180
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:38,120
right and so you can just uh right so

1181
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,120
you can just so so

1182
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,840
m here is given as the difference of

1183
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:46,480
those two and then divided by this and

1184
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,280
multiply by k factorial right so this

1185
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:53,040
defines m

1186
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:56,719
and so and now uh what you do is you

1187
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:59,040
then define h as before or similarly to

1188
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:06,800
before.

1189
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:12,239
H is then going to be f of x - p k -1 of

1190
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:16,640
x - m over k factorial

1191
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:19,760
x - a to the^ k

1192
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:24,960
right that's how you define

1193
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:29,400
uh h right and by definition of m

1194
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,400
by definition

1195
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:40,640
of m you have that h of b is equal to

1196
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,520
zero. Right? This is how this is another

1197
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,880
way of of saying how we defined m.

1198
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:51,040
Right?

1199
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:54,719
Now if you look at so now h of a

1200
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:59,440
well h of a here is

1201
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:05,679
um well h of a is just f of a

1202
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:10,159
minus p k minus one of a minus m over k

1203
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:13,120
factorial x - a to the power k and this

1204
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:15,679
is you know a so this one here is

1205
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:18,480
clearly zero A minus A is zero, right?

1206
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,040
So that's clearly zero.

1207
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:24,480
And this thing here, that's this

1208
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:27,600
polomial Ivered up here, right? So if

1209
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:30,080
you plug in here, A, you see this term

1210
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:34,000
here and all the other terms drops out.

1211
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:37,440
It's only this one that lives, right? So

1212
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,679
this thing here is this is the same as f

1213
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,679
of a.

1214
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,760
And so you have that the whole thing is

1215
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:48,719
actually zero. Right?

1216
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:52,239
So because we chose M this way, we see

1217
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:56,560
that now RM can get started. Right? And

1218
01:14:52,239 --> 01:15:00,320
so RM can get started and uh this means

1219
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:02,880
that there exist a C1 between A and B

1220
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:07,440
where the derivative of H is zero.

1221
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:11,040
Right? Now you check that the if you're

1222
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:14,719
looking at this function again that and

1223
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:18,719
take the derivative at a the derivative

1224
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:22,800
at a is also zero. Right? In fact, the

1225
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:26,719
the whole idea is that all these

1226
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:28,239
derivative up to the k minus one

1227
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,480
derivative

1228
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:32,800
of you know if you're looking at the k

1229
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:36,800
minus one all the way up to the k minus

1230
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:41,360
one derivative of h they are all zero at

1231
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:45,120
a. Okay. So you can repeat the romium.

1232
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,440
So this first here, this thing here

1233
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:50,400
together with this allows you to find

1234
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:53,920
this C1

1235
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,840
strictly between A and B where the

1236
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,840
derivative

1237
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:03,840
is is zero. Then you observe that the

1238
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:08,640
derivative of h at a is zero. This then

1239
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:12,960
allows you to find a point between

1240
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:16,080
a and a second point c1 which was less

1241
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:19,080
than b where the derivative second

1242
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,080
derivative

1243
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:26,080
is zero. Now you use that the second

1244
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:28,880
derivative at of h at a is also zero. So

1245
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:32,239
this give you you apply v theorem one

1246
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,880
more time. Each time you apply radium

1247
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:38,960
the se is moving to the left right

1248
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:43,600
towards a right and so you apply it

1249
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:46,640
uh you apply the k times and it and once

1250
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:50,960
you do this you get eventually that this

1251
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:55,199
m here is the derivative of of the

1252
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:58,080
original function at this point. Okay.

1253
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:00,800
So I I wrote this out. I now I did the

1254
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:03,840
special case and I try to explain this

1255
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,640
here. I wrote it out in the notes. It's

1256
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,320
written out in the general case only.

1257
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,320
But it on the other hand is written out

1258
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:13,719
completely there.

1259
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,719
Any questions?

1260
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,320
There's two things we didn't get to.

1261
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,760
There's these two rules about how to

1262
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,440
evaluate fractions that uses the Kushi

1263
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,760
mean value theorem and I'll start with

1264
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:30,679
those those they're in the notes but I

1265
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,679
will start with that next time. Yeah.

1266
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,920
then you get the the that's when you get

1267
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:44,000
the C that you're actually looking for,

1268
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,920
right? And so in the special case I

1269
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:51,120
looked at K was equal to two and the

1270
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:55,040
tailor expansion was a linear so it was

1271
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:59,440
a right it was a polomial of degree one.

1272
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:02,080
So k minus one was one right and so so

1273
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:04,080
in in the special case we applied them

1274
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:08,159
twice

1275
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,159
um and in this case we do it k
