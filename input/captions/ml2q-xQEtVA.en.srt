2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:16,243

3
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:17,160
MEGAN MITCHELL: Hello.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,090
Hello, and welcome to the third
session of the MIT Jameel World

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,490
Education Lab's AI
Innovation Series.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,690
I'm Megan Mitchell.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,770
I'm the acting director of
Jameel World Education Lab.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm going to abbreviate
that to J-WEL.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,940
The focus of today's session
is on emerging AI innovations,

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,560
new tools from
the MIT ecosystem.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,760
So for those of you who
aren't familiar with J-WEL,

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,570
is MIT's portal to our
expertise in research, teaching,

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,080
and experimentation.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,430
And we work J-We with
ambitious member institutions,

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,120
many of whom are here
today from around the world

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,990
to bring that mission to life
and for education designed

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,450
for everyone to thrive.

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:09,300
J-WEL was created in 2017 as a
connection point and a portal

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,210
and a lab for
co-creating new ideas.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,910
And from the start, we've
built active collaborations

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,860
with institutions
and individuals who

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,000
are really focused on trying to
change education for the better.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,030
I think we all recognize
that AI has the potential

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,000
to create important new
opportunities in education

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,910
and learning.

26
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,100
And particularly exciting
to me is the opportunity

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,820
it has to address challenges
for access to education.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,680
And today's panelists
have new approaches

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,910
that they've developed using AI
for this-- just this very goal.

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,240
And they've thoughtfully
explored new spaces for design

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,470
learning and adapting in
this rapidly evolving field.

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,930
So as part of our
panel today, you'll

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,220
hear from three panelists
representing two organizations.

34
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,820
The first recent MIT
alumna, Cerine Hamida,

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,100
who's the founder of 1for1, a
Tunisian-based company offering

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,270
a comprehensive, student centric
science learning system that

37
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,740
actually aligns with Tunisia's
national curriculum and features

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,340
state of the art adaptive
learning methodologies.

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,620
And really, the key benefit
she's bringing to bear

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,320
for the users are personalized
learning experiences tailored

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,230
to their proficiency levels,
interactive problem-solving

42
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,140
and 24/7 support from a
generative AI conversational

43
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,870
professor.

44
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,470
So as students are
studying on their schedule,

45
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,510
this tutor is available to them.

46
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,350
And 1for1 is not only designed
to enhance science competencies

47
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,160
but also increase student
motivation and reduce

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,540
the financial
burden of families.

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,520
So we're looking forward to
hearing some from Cerine.

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,960
And then also joining
us are two PhD students

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,030
from MIT, Bernardo Garcia
and Salome Augilar.

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,560
And they're here to
tell you about JANN,

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,210
an NGO dedicated to bringing
bridging the educational gap

54
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,020
in Mexico through a cost
effective tutoring platform that

55
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,070
is leveraging AI to automate the
logistical challenges associated

56
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,390
with managing a very large
scale tutoring program that

57
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,220
they've built and developed and
that has served 23,000 students

58
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,450
through its 7,000
tutors since 2021.

59
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,800
So you can imagine the logistics
and operational back end

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,693
to all of that.

61
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:44,110
And the platform
they've developed

62
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,630
automates everything
from the tutor training

63
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,580
to the student assessment
and to the progress tracking.

64
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,020
So we're excited
to hear from them.

65
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,490
But before I turn it
over to our panelists,

66
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,340
I'd like to invite my
colleague, Bill Bonvillian,

67
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,190
to set the stage for
this conversation.

68
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,610
Bill is the mastermind behind
J-WEL's thinking series

69
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,400
and has had an incredibly
distinguished career working

70
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,960
at the intersection of policy
and the new frontiers of science

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,200
and technology.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,350
He's advised senior
US officials.

73
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,029
He's led MIT'S Office
in Washington, DC,

74
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,790
and we're really
fortunate to have him

75
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,880
as a valued
colleague and trusted

76
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,980
member of the J-WEL team.

77
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,780
And he's brought together
these panelists for us today.

78
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,665
So, Bill, can I turn it over
to you for just a few words.

79
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:31,790
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Yes.

80
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,120
Thanks very much, Megan.

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,050
Just a few words on
the background today.

82
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,040
We're going to see some very
practical applications of AI

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
for education.

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,030
So we've had two
prior programs that

85
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,470
really discuss the theory
and the potential approaches.

86
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,720
Now we're going to have some
really practical applications.

87
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,930
So as Megan mentioned,
Cerine and her company,

88
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,300
1for1 in Tunisia, is attempting
to tackle some of the really

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,450
major education
problems in her country,

90
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:13,460
including sporadic access to
quality science education,

91
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,130
a one size fits all approach
that leads a lot of students

92
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,380
behind and a high cost of
traditional academic supporting

93
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,470
activities.

94
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,000
And she's using an adaptive
learning approach deeply

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,010
embedded in an AI system.

96
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,840
So it's a digital
tutoring system,

97
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,910
and the first big use is to
prepare secondary students

98
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,760
for the major exams they face.

99
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,830
In this case, the initial
run is on physics and math.

100
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,760
And the company will
launch on August 31.

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,180
And Cerine, I'm sure, has been
losing sleep continuously.

102
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,670
But hopefully, you'll stay
awake through the 31st.

103
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,160
Salome and Bernardo have a
massive tutoring program,

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,360
as Megan mentioned,
for students in Mexico

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,180
through their NGO, JANN, and
it ties University students

106
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,910
performing their required
hours of public service

107
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,990
to students throughout Mexico.

108
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,500
And they record
tutoring sessions

109
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,460
and are working to
attempt to draw out

110
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,990
through AI the most effective
teaching practices to get

111
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,200
to their tutors.

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,070
So we know some of the potential
uses of AI in education.

113
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,210
Personalization of education, it
can be difficult for one teacher

114
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,590
to figure out how to meet
the needs of every student

115
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,370
in his or her classroom.

116
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,080
But AI systems can help
adapt to each student's

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,390
individual learning
needs and really

118
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,040
target the instruction based
upon the student's strengths

119
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,510
and weaknesses.

120
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:58,510
Digital tutoring, AI systems can
gauge a student's learning style

121
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,990
learning approaches and
their preexisting knowledge

122
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,800
to really develop customized
support and instruction.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,530
Grading AI can help grade
simple exams using answer keys,

124
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,130
but it also can compile data
about how students performed

125
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,930
and have the potential to grade
more abstract assessments.

126
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,685
Feedback on course
teaching, if, for example,

127
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:28,560
a number of students
are answering a question

128
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,520
incorrectly, AI can focus
on this specific information

129
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,870
or concepts that
students are missing.

130
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,620
So, for example,
Salome and Bernardo

131
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,760
are going to be applying this
feedback capability from AI

132
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,840
and improving the performance
of the tutors that reached

133
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,870
their many enrolled students.

134
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,360
And then there's meaningful and
immediate feedback to students.

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
Some students may be
reluctant to take risks

136
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,060
in a classroom kind of setting.

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,690
But with AI, they can feel
more comfortable in making

138
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,070
the mistakes and
making mistakes they

139
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,340
need to do for learning and
receiving the feedback they need

140
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,990
to improve.

141
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,620
So today, we're discussing
actual applications,

142
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:22,420
and a number of these potential
parts of AI's contribution

143
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,970
education will
come to bear here.

144
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,200
So let me turn it
over first to Cerine.

145
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,640
CERINE HAMIDA: Thank you, Bill.

146
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,860
So I'll start by giving a
brief presentation of 1for1,

147
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,230
and then I'd like to do a
hands on demo of our platform.

148
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,870
So let's start with
the presentation.

149
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,530
So at 1for1, we believe that
every student deserves access

150
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,010
to personalized and
high quality education.

151
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,920
However, this is not the
reality for most high schoolers

152
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,420
around the world.

153
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,880
And in many countries,
such as Tunisia,

154
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,490
college entrance exams,
such as the Baccalaureate,

155
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,370
dictate students whole
life trajectories

156
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,000
from the universities that they
can attend to even the majors

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,130
that they are allowed to study.

158
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,570
And despite the
criticality of these exams,

159
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,020
access to quality
education is limited.

160
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,200
Demotivated students are trapped
in a one size fits all system

161
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,990
and are unable to
access quality content.

162
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,160
Even alternative solutions
aren't real solutions.

163
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,850
Group or private tutoring
are often ineffective,

164
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,160
financially burdensome, and
logistically challenging

165
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,405
leaving students without
the support that they need.

166
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:38,180

167
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,810
In Tunisia, this results in
two out of three students

168
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,030
failing in their first
Baccalaureate attempt,

169
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,720
and many end up dropping
high school altogether.

170
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,900
At 1for1, we created a product
that addresses the three key

171
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,010
issues of quality, access, and
personalization through four key

172
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,120
offerings.

173
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,060
I'll emphasize the first two
as they're heavily driven by.

174
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,490
First, our adaptive
learning system,

175
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,590
built on a four
pillar approach, which

176
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,460
I will later detail, this system
tailors lessons and exercises

177
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,930
to each student's learning
profile through three key steps.

178
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,390
First for each
chapter, the system

179
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,570
analyzes student
interactions and performances

180
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,500
to pinpoint exact strengths
and areas needing improvement.

181
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,520
Then, based on this analysis,
individual learning profiles

182
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,890
and goals are created.

183
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,100

184
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,740
Our adaptive learning
algorithms then guide students

185
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,650
through a customized learning
path, providing multiple choice

186
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,500
questions and
exercises in real time

187
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,870
to ensure appropriate
challenges and support,

188
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,780
helping students from
foundational concepts

189
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,196
to advanced applications.

190
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:51,220

191
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,210
So this is our AI personalized,
adaptive learning system.

192
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,250
We also have a generative
AI virtual assistant,

193
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,140
which serves as a
24/7 expert teacher.

194
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,860

195
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,710
[INAUDIBLE] So students
can ask it any questions

196
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,400
they have from clarifying
difficult concepts to helping

197
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,350
them work through exercises.

198
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,600
Students can even share
their handwritten work,

199
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,170
and the assistant will analyze
it, provide feedback, and offer

200
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,920
hints and additional resources.

201
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,060
The virtual assistant offers
personalized and contextualized

202
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,440
guidance that is in line
with the national curriculum.

203
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,190
So something that I
didn't mention earlier

204
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,410
is that all our
content on our platform

205
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,870
is built in-house by
our group of teachers.

206
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,220
And so the virtual assistant
is trained specifically

207
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,400
on our content.

208
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,460
And everything
that it works with

209
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,340
is guided by the
national curriculum.

210
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,660
So these are our
first two offerings.

211
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,230
We also have progress
tracking, which

212
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,570
allows students to
monitor their performance,

213
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,440
better understand
the way they learn,

214
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,890
and even set their
personalized goals.

215
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,140
And finally, we
offer a one stop shop

216
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,770
that connects students to a wide
range of external resources.

217
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,530
So from animated concepts
for deeper learning-- so

218
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,220
we have links to
PhET simulations,

219
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,510
for example, to well-being
support and even career

220
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,150
and college planning tools.

221
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,110
So with these core
offerings in place,

222
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,110
it's important to understand
the philosophy that

223
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,500
drives our approach.

224
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,580
At 1for1, our methodology
is rooted in the science

225
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,190
of learning.

226
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,130
So we're really
emphasizing the importance

227
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,320
of structured and
progressive learning

228
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,860
to achieve effective results.

229
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,420
For example, that we
can see over here,

230
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,680
Bloom's taxonomy is
a central concept

231
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,020
in the field of
learning sciences.

232
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,070
So learning occurs in stages
through a hierarchical order.

233
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,600
You start by recalling
basic knowledge.

234
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,310
So that's the bottom
of the pyramid.

235
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,860
Then you move on to
understanding these concepts,

236
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,110
applying them,
analyzing, evaluating.

237
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,810
And finally, you're
able to create

238
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,410
new ideas from that knowledge.

239
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,440
Our four pillar approach
reflects this hierarchy.

240
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,600
First, students build
their competencies

241
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,890
through lessons in
multiple choice questions.

242
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,980
They verify their
competencies, then

243
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,730
do open exercises that emphasize
the teaching of problem

244
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,180
solving methodologies.

245
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,032
They [AUDIO OUT]
through exercises,

246
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,740
through mock exams
that are complete with

247
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,840
minimal and optional hints.

248
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,720
In the early stages of learning,
when students are grasping

249
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,210
material and learning
how to apply it,

250
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,560
maximum guidance is needed.

251
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,520
And this is why our first
two pillars are adaptive,

252
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,340
meaning that 1for1 selects
the multiple choice question,

253
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,270
selects the exercises, the
topics that the student needs

254
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,390
to focus on, and gives
them personalized tips

255
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,870
and methodologies.

256
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,210
However, in later
stages, we want

257
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,910
to foster personal
initiative, and it's

258
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,120
important for the students to
know how to apply knowledge

259
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,470
autonomously.

260
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,990
So that's why the last
two pillars give students

261
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,980
more control.

262
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,040
It allows them to choose their
own exercises from a list that's

263
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,830
given to them and review the
topics that they want to review.

264
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,590
So they get less guidance
than the previous steps.

265
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,340
And with that, I'll
move on to the demo.

266
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,160
But just wanted to shout
out one of my co-founders

267
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,780
who wasn't here today.

268
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,240
Teimurazi is also
a student at MIT,

269
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,980
and we've been really building
all the AI systems together.

270
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:41,170
So now I'll just jump into
the demo of the platform.

271
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,910
And we'll concretely
show you how

272
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,450
all of these four pillars
and our four offerings

273
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,500
work together.

274
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,810
Upon logging into
your account, students

275
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,820
will find themselves
in the My Space

276
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,430
section, where they can
see the list of subjects

277
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,610
that they're studying.

278
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,110
So for the first
year in Tunisia,

279
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,670
we're offering math and
physics, physics, chemistry

280
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,010
for Tunisian high schoolers.

281
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,920
They can also see
the distribution

282
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,260
of time spent working on
the four pillars here.

283
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,030
Here it's a newly
created account,

284
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,630
so the distribution
isn't quite clear.

285
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,480
But also they can
see the time spent

286
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,130
working on the
platform every month

287
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,690
for the different subjects.

288
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,080
In the sidebar on the
left, they have access

289
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,670
to the four pillars
and also quick access

290
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,790
to the different subjects.

291
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,450
So let's start working in math.

292
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,070
So once you select
a subject, you

293
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,110
get the list of chapters
that are related to it.

294
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,130
And every chapter is
divided into topics

295
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,220
that the student will learn
in chronological order.

296
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,130
So you can see here some
of the topics are locked,

297
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,740
meaning the adaptive
learning systems still

298
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,600
think that the
students need to revise

299
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,990
their prereqs and the previous
topics before giving it to them.

300
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,110
And some topics are unlocked
and students already--

301
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,900
the student is already
working on them.

302
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,280
The student has easy access to
the different pillars over here,

303
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
and the last pillar is revised.

304
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,550
It's not linked to
a specific chapter.

305
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,900
It's a whole revision.

306
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,800
So that's why it's just
present on the sidebar.

307
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,790
So let's hop into the first
pillar, which is built

308
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,920
competencies.

309
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,700
So when students
are first learning,

310
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,680
they need to get acquainted
with the lessons.

311
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,370
So they have in the sidebar
access to the full lesson

312
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,920
divided in the different topics.

313
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,660
They cannot view the lessons
of the topics that are still

314
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,160
locked.

315
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,090
So here I'm trying to click
on it, but it won't open.

316
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,870
But I can definitely see the
lesson of the topics that

317
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,422
are unlocked.

318
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,880
The lessons are
very detailed, have

319
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,390
definitions, properties,
even examples.

320
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,140
For more complicated lessons,
we have illustrations also

321
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,320
and even proofs.

322
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,740
If at any time I'm
confused about something,

323
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,300
I have at the top, our virtual
assistant that is present

324
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,530
everywhere in the platform
on all four pillars,

325
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,520
and I can ask it any
questions that I have.

326
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,790
So for example, here,
let's do an example.

327
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,869
And basically, how you can
ask the virtual assistant

328
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,319
any question that you
have to build competencies

329
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,990
with the multiple
choice questions.

330
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,040
So here a student received
personalized multiple choice

331
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
questions based on
their learning profiles,

332
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,480
and they have two
attempts to answer them.

333
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,270
So I'm going to purposefully
answer this one wrongly.

334
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,060
If I answer incorrectly,
I'm giving g--

335
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,960
I'm giving a personalized
hint based on the mistake type

336
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,790
that I made.

337
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,550
So here the platform
really guides you

338
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,850
and understands which are the
concepts that you probably

339
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,800
don't understand.

340
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,470
Of course, at any time,
you have at the top right,

341
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,610
the virtual teaching
assistant that you

342
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,840
can ask any questions
that you have,

343
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,130
even upload photos of
your handwritten work,

344
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,520
and it will help guide
you if you're stuck.

345
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,100

346
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,110
So let's answer this one again.

347
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,830
So once you finished
answering it,

348
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,010
it'll give you the explanation.

349
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,270
What's the right answer,
what you selected,

350
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,020
and it will give you another
multiple choice question that's

351
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,380
tailored to your profile.

352
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,250
Now, more interestingly, let's
go to verify my competencies.

353
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,970
So again, like in build
competencies and verify,

354
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,560
you're given personalized
exercises based on your profile.

355
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,090
So the first
interface, the student

356
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,870
will just read the full problem.

357
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,900
But then once you
start working, it's

358
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,220
going to be divided,
step-by-step,

359
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,580
question-by-subquestion, and
subquestion-by-subquestion.

360
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,370
With verify competencies,
we don't just

361
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,250
want to provide students
with learning opportunities.

362
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,930
We want to help them improve
their problem solving skills.

363
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,380
And we do that in multiple
ways, first of all,

364
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,780
by giving them personalized
hints to the type of question

365
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,360
that they're solving, and
these hints are actually

366
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,160
linked to methodologies.

367
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,250
They'll be repeating.

368
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,670
They'll be the same
hints over and over again

369
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,420
for similar question
types as the student

370
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,900
works on the same chapter.

371
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,430
So the student can do the
pattern matching themselves.

372
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, I see a specific
type of question.

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,690
I always see that this is the
best methodology to use it,

374
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,470
and automatically they
learn these methodologies

375
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,570
and how to apply them.

376
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,030
Another way we help students
with their methodologies

377
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,000
is by asking them to
submit their work.

378
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
And they can either
do that by directly

379
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,880
typing in their mathematical
keyboard, or what they can do

380
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,960
is they can take photos of their
handwritten work and upload

381
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,580
them.

382
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,300
It'll then transcribe students
work and allow the student

383
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,950
to make some corrections
if necessary.

384
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,180
So here there's just a
little bit of notation.

385
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,980
I didn't write it very
clearly, to be honest,

386
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,950
but I can just correct it
and then confirm my answer.

387
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,490

388
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,460
And you'll see here that it'll
give you personalized feedback.

389
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,360
The first line that tell you
is that whether you answered

390
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,660
correctly or incorrectly.

391
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,790
I purposefully forgot
a case in my answer.

392
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,660
I did a small
mathematical error,

393
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,690
so it correctly identified
that this is incorrect.

394
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,830
What it will also do is give
you personalized feedback

395
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,270
on your work.

396
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,910
So for example, here I
answered incorrectly.

397
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,740
It will tell you exactly--

398
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,890
It'll tell me exactly
what the mistake I made

399
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,850
and why and how to rectify it.

400
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,230
And it depends.

401
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,690
Some scenarios, for example,
student answered correctly,

402
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,960
but their composition of
their answer isn't great.

403
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,670
Maybe they skipped
a lot of steps

404
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,890
or just wrote the final answer
without explaining it well.

405
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,950
This will make them lose points
in the Baccalaureate exams.

406
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,780
We actually evaluate how the
students compose their answer

407
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,030
and give them tips on how
to word things better,

408
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,430
on how to make their composition
more logical for Baccalaureate

409
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,460
exam level answers.

410
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,070
And then, finally, we also help
them with their methodologies.

411
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,670
It's possible that you
perfectly answered correctly

412
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,260
in a mathematically
sound methodology,

413
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,930
but that just takes way
too many unnecessary steps.

414
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,320
It'll tell the
student, congrats.

415
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,980
This is good.

416
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,760
This is correct, but there's
a much easier way of doing it.

417
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,360
And it'll explain to
the student how and why.

418
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,420
Again, students have access
to the virtual assistant

419
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,180
on the right.

420
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,690
So this won't-- OK, my
internet is a bit lagging,

421
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,570
but it will open up.

422
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,180
And they can ask any
questions that they have,

423
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,090
even resend their photos
of their updated work,

424
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,330
and it'll help them out.

425
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,120
So these two are
adaptive sections.

426
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,310
Just because of time issues.

427
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,060
I'll just quickly
gloss over Test Myself.

428
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,230
So as you can see, this
is an autonomous section.

429
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,670
So you're not getting one
exercise recommended to you.

430
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,350
You get a whole list of them.

431
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,870
But they are actually sorted
in the order of recommendation.

432
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,630
But it's up to the
student to choose

433
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,400
which one they want to work on.

434
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,510
And unlike verify
competencies, they actually

435
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,220
do the whole exercise in one
go, then send their answer,

436
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,310
and then get the feedback.

437
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,040
It's not broken
down step-by-step

438
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,530
because here we assume
that the student already

439
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,890
has the foundation to be
able to do it themselves.

440
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,790
And with that, this
concludes my demo.

441
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,440
MEGAN MITCHELL:
Thank you, Cerine.

442
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,160
Excellent.

443
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,740
It's great to see it
working and really

444
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,160
get into the nuts and bolts.

445
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,170
It's one thing to hear, but to
be able to see it working really

446
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,220
brings it to life, which I think
is appreciated for all of us.

447
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,510
Let's turn it over now to Salome
and Bernardo to talk about JANN

448
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,100
and share their work
with you as well.

449
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,220
And as I mentioned in the
chat, if you have questions,

450
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,480
I would appreciate if
you put them there.

451
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,350
Include your name and
your organization,

452
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,590
so we all know who you are.

453
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,920
And we will have time.

454
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,190
I have questions, but I'll
also be taking questions

455
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,010
from the audience.

456
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,523
And I know Bill has
some too, so all right.

457
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:38,190
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES:
OK, sounds great.

458
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,260
Thank you, Megan.

459
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,080
And a very impressive the work
that you're doing, Cerine.

460
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,570
We're going to share our screen.

461
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,980
OK, so we're going to talk
about Jovenes Ayudando A Ninas Y

462
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,510
Ninos, which is this NGO that
Bernardo and I along with two

463
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,240
more friends co-founded in 2021.

464
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,860
And just in short or in
a summary, what we do

465
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,880
is that we provide free
online math tutoring

466
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,070
for children in primaries
and middle schools in Mexico.

467
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,350
And we do this by coordinating
a university students who

468
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,010
volunteer as tutors.

469
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,850
So in Mexico, in order to
graduate from University,

470
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,600
which we have learned is the
case in other Latin American

471
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,750
countries and probably in other
countries around the world,

472
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,590
students in University
need to do a social service

473
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,560
to graduate as a
requirement from University

474
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,720
and to get their
University degree.

475
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,000
So what we do is we
partner with universities

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,040
so that students can do
this social service with us.

477
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,770
We don't pay them, but we help
them meet this requirement.

478
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,470
And then we put them in touch
with children to teach math.

479
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,200
So I'm going to dive a little
bit into the details of how

480
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,140
we do this.

481
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,690
On the one side, on
the one side here

482
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,450
to the left, we partner with
elementary education ministries.

483
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,040
In this case, we have done this
with seven states around Mexico

484
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,460
to promote JANN, the NGO.

485
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,000
Children will enroll for
free in our platform.

486
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,010
They can answer-- when
they open a profile,

487
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,330
they will need to answer a set
of initial evaluations, a math

488
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,130
evaluation that will
allow us to measure

489
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,550
the impact of the program.

490
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,780
They will also answer
other demographic services

491
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,810
that we get to the population
that is working with us.

492
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,600
And then on the other side,
we will form agreements

493
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,748
with different universities
around, in this case, in Mexico

494
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:34,290
so that the University students
can meet these social service

495
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,770
requirements that I was talking
about as tutors in JANN.

496
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,430
So I think the big
value add that we

497
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,940
bring to the table is that we're
able to coordinate these two

498
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,050
groups of people using a
platform that we developed

499
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,090
and that has helped us impact
thousands of students with very,

500
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,620
very little resources.

501
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,310
The way in which we do this
is that students will open up

502
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,720
a profile in our website,
and they will first

503
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,870
be welcomed with a set
of initial trainings

504
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,100
that are asynchronous
that we recorded.

505
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,670
And they're a little bit
similar to a Coursera course

506
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,070
where they can watch a video
and answer a set of questions.

507
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,460
And then we also
will interview them

508
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,910
to get to know them and make
sure that they're [INAUDIBLE]

509
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,610
to work with children.

510
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,140
We then will form
automatically groups

511
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,460
of five students and one tutor.

512
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,570
And we will message both
the students, the parents,

513
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,460
and the tutor to let them know
that they have been matched.

514
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,860
The tutor will then
go to their platform.

515
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,110
They will be able to see
the information of students.

516
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,370
And in this case, they just
see the number and the name,

517
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:43,400
and they will be able to do a
WhatsApp group with the parents,

518
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,990
with the students, and introduce
themselves as their tutor

519
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,910
and set up a time
and day for meeting.

520
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,690
And usually they will
meet two hours per week

521
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,388
for 12 to 24 weeks.

522
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,930
This depends on the
agreement that we

523
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,530
have with each university.

524
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,430
Then after that, our
system will allow

525
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,000
us to monitor their progress.

526
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,950
So tutors have to upload an
attendance report every time

527
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,390
they teach a class, and we
will be sending them messages

528
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,750
if we notice that they are
not giving their classes.

529
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,100
And also in the case that
it takes a lot of time

530
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,330
since they have
given the last class,

531
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,200
they will maybe be
kicked out of the program

532
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
and assigned another
tutor for the same group.

533
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,420
So kind of the idea here
is that we are really

534
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,440
lowering the costs of logistics
and of organizing this program

535
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,430
because all of this check
up is made automatically.

536
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,550
Then towards the end of
the work together, children

537
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:44,320
will take an online evaluation,
another math exam, which

538
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,120
will allow us to
measure their progress

539
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,630
and their learning
in the platform

540
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,500
but also has been the
reason why we have

541
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,490
been able to do a research.

542
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,030
So Bernardo is going to be
talking a little bit more

543
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,670
about how we do research
in this platform.

544
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,650
And what has been our
impact since 2021, well,

545
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,730
we have coordinated and more
than 7,000 tutors meet with more

546
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:09,190
than 23,000 students at an
average cost of $2 per month per

547
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,670
classes per student.

548
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:17,050
And this we have achieved
with a team of two

549
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,360
to six people working in Mexico.

550
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,930
So we think that
using technologies,

551
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,860
we can really scale the
impact of this project.

552
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,680
Because we have seen other
tutoring programs that

553
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,500
don't make use of technology
and then they are capped,

554
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,400
the scale is capped
that they can reach.

555
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,730
And in the first
iteration of our program,

556
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,910
we did an experiment
where we wanted to measure

557
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,690
the impact in learning.

558
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,570
So we had a treatment group
that received tutoring,

559
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,330
and then we had a
control group that

560
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,470
didn't receive tutoring
for one semester

561
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,300
but then received
tutoring after.

562
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,060
But they did do an exam
before and after the months

563
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,380
where we evaluated.

564
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:04,060
And we measure that, on
average, the students who

565
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,070
received tutoring
improved learning

566
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:10,330
in 0.14 standard deviations in
the first two months of classes.

567
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,970
And just to put this
number into context,

568
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,290
this is about 15% to 20%
the learning loss caused

569
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,370
by the pandemic in Mexico.

570
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,860
And so we think
in average, people

571
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,900
who participate in
this program are

572
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,290
able to recover the learning
loss in less than one year.

573
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,440
And just to talk about the
scale that this could reach,

574
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,490
we have seen a
lot of willingness

575
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,420
from tutors to connect
with children to help.

576
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,690
And we know that the tutors that
we have right now participating

577
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,770
in the program are less than
1% of the potential tutors

578
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,600
or potential university
students that we

579
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,820
have in Mexico, as well as, on
the other side, the children.

580
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,670
So we really think
of these programs

581
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,890
as a tool that can make the
population of University

582
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,960
students work for
their community

583
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,860
and work to impact education
and also, to some extent,

584
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:14,920
build this social cohesion among
different groups in the society.

585
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,670
So who is a student in JANN.

586
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,840
In general, students--
most of our students

587
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,800
are attending a public
school, more than 90%

588
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,290
They are also in the first
two quintiles of the income

589
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,410
distribution in Mexico,
more than half of them.

590
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,400
Also more than 40% of them
don't have any family members

591
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,720
who attended University.

592
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,360
So it's very important
and very crucial

593
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,610
for them to meet this tutor
who is going to be meeting

594
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,800
with them for several months.

595
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,300
And also after the
program, more than 70%

596
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,380
report that they're going
to miss their tutor.

597
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,660
So we're talking about deep
connections that are being made.

598
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,770
Another thing that
I don't have here

599
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,970
is that also we know that
more than 40% of our students

600
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,480
connect from a cell phone.

601
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,070
They don't have
access to a computer,

602
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,550
but they're still connecting
to classes with the resources

603
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,200
that they have.

604
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,870

605
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,300
BERNARDO GARCA BULLE
BUENO: Thank you, Salome.

606
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,000
JANN, as Salome
said, we have tried

607
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,210
to reach a really huge
scale and make thousands

608
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,830
of connections in Mexico.

609
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,890
But at the same time,
we believe that JANN

610
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,640
is more than just numbers.

611
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,060
And we get to see this
every time we make events

612
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,900
on a yearly basis, usually
with all our tutors

613
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,430
and all our children.

614
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:42,280
And hearing the experiences that
they have, we become really--

615
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,440
our passion for this
project rekindles.

616
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,750
Something that really matters
to us is, as Salome said,

617
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,690
only about--

618
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,590
about half of our students have
a relative who went to college.

619
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,760
And what this means is
that maybe a kid in Mexico

620
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,150
can grow up without ever having
a connection with someone who

621
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,340
went to University,
a real connection

622
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,800
where the person feels
trust to ask for advice

623
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,300
and to even see themselves
in their shoes and say,

624
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,250
maybe I can also go to college.

625
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:18,170
So for us, that's something
that also matters a lot in JANN.

626
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,800
Here are some testimonies
from our program.

627
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,760
And from what you hopefully
can see, we have--

628
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,870
these are fairly representative
from our population.

629
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,150
And students,
parents, and tutors

630
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,310
usually get a really good
experience from JANN.

631
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,860
And on the other
side, JANN is also

632
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,850
a platform where everything
is controlled by a software

633
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,390
that we built ourselves.

634
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,550
And this has allowed us to do
many kinds of randomizations

635
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,430
that usually one cannot do in
a regular educational setting,

636
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,780
such as a school, for example,
making groups where everyone has

637
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,700
the same skill, everyone
has different skills.

638
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,200
It's just girls,
just boys, and even

639
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,710
varying the content
of the class.

640
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,090
So sometimes we have done
RCTs, where half of our kids

641
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,510
receive this supplemental social
emotional learning lessons

642
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,200
along with their math classes.

643
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,940
And after we did JANN
on that first summer,

644
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,320
we realized that hand could
become an education lab,

645
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,470
where we can ask many of these
relevant education questions

646
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,650
that just cannot be asked in
a normal education setting.

647
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:32,690
Just to highlight two of them,
right now we have recorded more

648
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,980
than 200,000 hours of lessons,
and we are trying to understand

649
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,370
who are the best tutors.

650
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,860
This is not a trivial
question because there have--

651
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,260
as many of you might know
from the world of education,

652
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,710
there have been many
efforts in the past

653
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:51,820
to try to explain what makes
a good teacher good and using,

654
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,470
for example, standardized tests.

655
00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:00,840
And that has been right now,
I think, about 10% or 15%

656
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,060
of the variance is
explained but not more.

657
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,120
A lot of what makes
a good teacher

658
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,540
doesn't rely on demographics
or even things that

659
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,570
are a bit important
like experience.

660
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,030
So what we're trying to do in
JANN is let's take these 200,000

661
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,940
recordings, and let's pass them
through our machine learning

662
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,889
algorithms and extract what
really makes a good teacher.

663
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,290
This is Alberta.

664
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,400
We're really excited
about that, and we're

665
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,239
trying to finish it
in the next semester.

666
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,040
The other part that
we're excited about is

667
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,469
we have a project where we--

668
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:38,610
is the one I mentioned
where some kids received

669
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,159
this social emotional education
along with their math content.

670
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,010
We also grouped kids by skills.

671
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,340
This was actually
funded by J-WEL,

672
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,230
so it's really exciting to
talk about in these forums.

673
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,880
And then what we
saw were two things.

674
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,730
Mainly is that in groups of 5,
which is the size of our groups,

675
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,410
the skill heterogeneity
didn't really

676
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,785
affect the progress
of the groups.

677
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:06,160
And the other
thing that we found

678
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,100
was that giving the
kids the opportunity

679
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,540
to have these social emotional
learning with the tutor

680
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,363
improved their math performance.

681
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,780
And right now we're
doing a follow

682
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,447
up activity trying to
understand exactly, why was it

683
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:21,530
that they made a better
connection with the tutor,

684
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,280
was it that the tutor improved
their skills in some way

685
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,030
or that the kids
improved their skills.

686
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,900
But so far, what we do
know is that the tutors

687
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,330
made their classes longer when
they were in this treatment

688
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,930
group, even the math classes.

689
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,950
They even gave more classes
than what was required.

690
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,690
And another important
thing is that the emotions

691
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,420
in the audio of the classes were
more positive, more activating.

692
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,630
So we definitely
saw how it is good.

693
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,160
It was a good intervention.

694
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,113
And I think Salome
wanted to add something.

695
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:52,780
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES:
You say that make

696
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,610
me make the parentheses that
the idea here is that we

697
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,440
have this large scale program.

698
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,800
We have thousands of
hours of recordings,

699
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,980
and we have AI to
process these recordings

700
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,320
and allow us to do
the type of research

701
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,050
that usually qualitative
researchers do in a large scale.

702
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,760
So we want to make this bridge
between quantitative research

703
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,720
that mostly focuses on
dropout rates on scores

704
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,450
and not really on how
students are interacting

705
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,280
and the classroom
atmosphere that

706
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,080
usually is the key of
qualitative research.

707
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,590
So we are really
working and very

708
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,280
excited to be bridging these two
lines of research in education

709
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,450
because we see them
both as very valuable,

710
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,065
and we see an opportunity
here to do this.

711
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:43,440

712
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,630
And another thing that
we also wanted to mention

713
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,980
is that we have seen--

714
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:54,200
I think our goal doing JANN
is to impact as many children

715
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,280
as we can.

716
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,582
And we have formed partnerships
with governments in Mexico,

717
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:01,040
with universities,
and we're trying

718
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,280
to really scale the program
because we see the potential.

719
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,100
But we are sometimes a bit
limited by the resources

720
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,310
that we have to actually reach
enough participants or more

721
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,220
participants.

722
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,750
And we're working on it.

723
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,760
And we know there will
be a lot of opportunity.

724
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,820
But suddenly,
another way that we

725
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,790
thought that can help
us reach this scale

726
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,640
is simply sharing this
software that we already

727
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,540
did with other institutions
so that they can themselves

728
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,550
create programs like
ours designed by them

729
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,730
but with the
advantages of lowering

730
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,680
the logistical costs
and the setup costs,

731
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,920
and that they can impact their
communities in other countries.

732
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,780
Because I guess one question
that we got at some point

733
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,170
was like, would you be
interested in taking JANN

734
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,340
to Colombia.

735
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,950
And I thought about it and
I was like that's so far.

736
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,030
I don't know anything of
the Colombian context.

737
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,403
I don't know people in Colombia.

738
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:57,570
I wouldn't know where to
start forming relationships

739
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,870
with universities.

740
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,430
But suddenly thinking of we
can actually just reach out

741
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,700
to one University, give them
our software, give them our

742
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,620
know how, and it will
be full of people

743
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,990
who know exactly
who to reach out to,

744
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,730
who know exactly what
the problems are,

745
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,350
and how to help the communities
surrounding the University.

746
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,490
So what we're going to have
more programs like JANN

747
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,720
spread out around the world and
impact thousands of children

748
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,110
and have really the
community involved.

749
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,150
I guess, what we
like a lot about JANN

750
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,430
is that it's forming
all of these connections

751
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,340
in a country like ours that is
very separated and very unequal.

752
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,480

753
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,220
And technology is
providing the safe space

754
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,190
to get together again,
if that makes sense.

755
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,760
Well, we thank you a lot.

756
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,360
And we're leaving here
our contact information.

757
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,350
And I don't know if we
want to add something else,

758
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,270
or we can maybe move
on to the questions.

759
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,560

760
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,030
MEGAN MITCHELL: Fantastic.

761
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,450
Fantastic.

762
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,620
I mean, I don't know.

763
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,500
You can see it from some of
the comments in the chat,

764
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,020
but I know I am, certainly,
inspired by the work

765
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,600
you're doing.

766
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,100
And I think it
really interesting is

767
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,930
the juxtaposition of how you're
approaching impacting people

768
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,890
at scale.

769
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:21,380
You have Cerine who's
using it for the AI

770
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,780
is touching the students,
right, and working directly

771
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,870
with the students.

772
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,440
You're thinking about
how you can use it

773
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,030
at JANN on the back
end to really reduce

774
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,620
the cost and the resources,
right, that are--

775
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,790
and so that you can get
more people into your system

776
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:43,040
and still maintain that personal
touch but then learn from it

777
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,060
and accelerate learning.

778
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,280
So there's just so
much rich, really

779
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,293
interesting ways that AI is
being applied that I don't I

780
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:53,960
really don't believe
people are thinking

781
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,450
about on a day-to-day basis.

782
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,730
And so I have some questions.

783
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,470
And as I mentioned do
if you have questions,

784
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,110
put them in the chat.

785
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,330
I would encourage you
to just mention your--

786
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,320
your first name is
obviously there,

787
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,810
but your institution would be
really helpful for context.

788
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,980
But one of the
things came up even

789
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,720
as you're thinking about
this from two different sides

790
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,140
of the business spectrum,
the backend business

791
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,360
side and the direct to the--

792
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,980
direct to the students.

793
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,170
Trust seems like an
important element

794
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,210
that you need to
think about throughout

795
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,170
the entire development.

796
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,360
I think there's still there
are questions of how much

797
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,430
can we rely on this.

798
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,130
So I'm curious how
you think about--

799
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,340
Cerine, you trust
from the standpoint

800
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,210
of having people believe
that this will help them

801
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,850
and that this automated
tutor is giving them

802
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,570
the support they need.

803
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:58,560
But then, as you're
pulling out best practices,

804
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,830
Salome and Bernardo,
how are people

805
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,500
saying, how do you
believe that those will

806
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,120
be trusted or responded to from
people who come from a more

807
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,720
traditional background
of teaching and education

808
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,515
and think, no, no, the teacher
needs to be at the center.

809
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,840

810
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,340
SALOME AUGILAR
LLANES: I don't know.

811
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,170
Do you want to start,
Cerine, and then we can--

812
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,133
CERINE HAMIDA: You can
start, and I'll continue.

813
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:27,300
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES: Sure.

814
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,550
Yeah, so for us, the
work with teachers

815
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,250
has been super important
because we get to students

816
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,400
through teachers.

817
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,020
And something that we have
really tried to convey

818
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,020
is the message that
we see can as a tool

819
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,690
in the toolkit of teachers
to share with their students.

820
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,290
So we are not here to replace
the teacher, not at all.

821
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,370
We're here to help them
go back to the topics

822
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,450
that they might not be
able to cover in class.

823
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,490
So imagine specifically in
Mexico, in the pandemic,

824
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,390
the students didn't go to
class almost for two years.

825
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,740
Like, schools were closed.

826
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,460
And many students did
not have the resources

827
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,850
to connect with their teachers.

828
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,550
So this means that
for two years they

829
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,310
have huge gaps of
knowledge, and these gaps

830
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,520
are all over the place.

831
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,310
So it's not like
the teacher can say

832
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,550
we're going to go back and learn
to multiply because there still

833
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,900
maybe going to be students
that do know how to multiply

834
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,900
but miss the part of how to
divide or how to sum a fraction.

835
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,440
And so the teacher
has a responsibility,

836
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,420
and they have to
cover a curriculum.

837
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,960
And they don't have the time
in the classroom-- usually

838
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,270
classrooms in Mexico
have 30, 40 students.

839
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:36,550
They don't have the time
to realize or sit down

840
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,820
with each student, know
what they don't, and go

841
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,060
back and teach that.

842
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,980
So here is where
the tutor steps in.

843
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,130
So the tutor only
has five students,

844
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,010
and the tutor will learn
these the gaps of knowledge

845
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,550
that the students have.

846
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,400
And instead of teaching what
the teacher is teaching,

847
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,810
they are free.

848
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,940
They can cover any
part of the curriculum.

849
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,640
They can adapt their
teaching to the student.

850
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,240
And so they're going to go back,
fill these gaps in knowledge

851
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,440
so that the student, when
they come back to class,

852
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,720
they're ready to learn what
the teacher is teaching.

853
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,520
So it's, kind of,
like a teamwork.

854
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,490
And actually our
platform allows teachers

855
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:13,330
to open a profile and
message the tutor to ask them

856
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,980
to cover the specific topics.

857
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,320
So we really want them to
feel accompanied and helped

858
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,860
by our program more
than challenged.

859
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,810
Yeah, so I guess that's
how we are trying

860
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,430
to build trust with them.

861
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,597
MEGAN MITCHELL: Interesting.

862
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:29,930
Interesting.

863
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:30,530
Cerine?

864
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:34,550
CERINE HAMIDA: So yes, for
us, trust and effectiveness

865
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,660
has really been at the core
of our development approach.

866
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,360
And we've actually been
extensively testing

867
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,470
the platform with students
since day really 15.

868
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,790
And every pillar that we've had
has been introduced and tested

869
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,540
with students separately.

870
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,120
And we've gotten detailed
feedback on all of them.

871
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,130
This includes the
introduction and use

872
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,000
of the virtual assistant,
which was something a bit

873
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,280
scary if you haven't
seen it before

874
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,290
or you haven't interacted with
a virtual assistant before.

875
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,800
But very quickly,
we got the students

876
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,910
to trust it a lot as we were
tweaking it and building it

877
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,700
in a way that really it
interacts with students

878
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,550
and tailors to their needs.

879
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,880
After that initial-- so
we've spent a, kind of,

880
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,010
a year developing this with
our initial group of students.

881
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,740
And then recently
in the summer we

882
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,690
decided to bring in a new
group of students, 35 students.

883
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,680
They're actually going to
be taking the Baccalaureate

884
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,370
this coming school year.

885
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:40,710
And we got them through two
different types of tests, a user

886
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,740
experience week, where
we got their feedback

887
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,660
on understanding--
their understanding

888
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,850
of the methodology,
their reaction

889
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,110
to the use of new things.

890
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,540
Like, multiple
choice questions are

891
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,620
quite unfamiliar for a
lot of Tunisian students.

892
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,980
And we saw them--

893
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,710
we saw that they really
got the hang of it.

894
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,570
They found the platform
to be really easy

895
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,650
and trusted it from the get go.

896
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,260
Then, of course, we really
had to look at effectiveness.

897
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,430
Is this really working?

898
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,270
Because if it's effective,
then automatically the student

899
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,600
will be hooked and will
know that it will help them.

900
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,170
And what we did for that
is for the second week,

901
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,080
we gave them a test
at the beginning

902
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,260
of the week about a subject that
they haven't studied before,

903
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,590
which is complex numbers.

904
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,840
Then we let them work on
the platform by themselves

905
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,130
after 12 hours of use and gave
them the same test, essentially.

906
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:46,170
We saw scores going from
a D to an A or a B plus.

907
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,210
There were huge, huge
improvements in performance

908
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,150
just for one week--
after one week.

909
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,140
And so students already
were a lot more confident,

910
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,100
and that made them
trust it more.

911
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,340
A lot of them actually
started recommending it

912
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,660
to their friends.

913
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,188
And this was even before we
haven't officially launched yet,

914
00:46:05,188 --> 00:46:06,230
but they already trusted.

915
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,680
They're already recommending it.

916
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,370
And it's because they
saw these results.

917
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,820
And we actually gave them
pretty difficult tests.

918
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,740
So the fact that many of
them got A's and high B's

919
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,160
proves that this is effective,
and obviously, effectiveness

920
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,400
helps build trust.

921
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
MEGAN MITCHELL: Amazing.

922
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,910
Great.

923
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,310
Another question I have--

924
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,310
we've heard-- I mean, we
know there's so much promise

925
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,160
to this the technology and
different ways it can be used.

926
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,630
But there are, including people
in the chat who've mentioned,

927
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,420
the concerns around
does overreliance

928
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,290
on tools like this limit
critical thinking ability,

929
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,240
or connectivity issues, does
this further separate people

930
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,360
who have high bandwidth
connectivity from those

931
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,580
who have lower bandwidth?

932
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,650
I'm curious, like,
where do you see--

933
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,330
where you are cautious about the
unintended consequences of some

934
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:10,540
of these uses of technology and
how you've thought about that

935
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,898
as you've built and designed.

936
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:14,690
CERINE HAMIDA: Yes.

937
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,610
So talking about the
accessibility and connectivity

938
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,250
issue, I'll talk
about that one first.

939
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,410
We've made our platform
to be able to be

940
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:28,360
used even without having
laptops, just with a phone.

941
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,870
It doesn't have to be a
high performance phone.

942
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,140
It works pretty well.

943
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,440
Thankfully, everybody
has access to a phone,

944
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,460
and students are able to work on
the four pillars on their phone.

945
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,125
And we haven't really
seen huge issues.

946
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:46,250
MEGAN MITCHELL: How about
you, Salome and Bernardo?

947
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,708
BERNARDO GARCA BULLE BUENO: So
I think for us that has been

948
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:54,310
a question since the start of
how to reach the kids in-- the--

949
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,280
the last mile kids, so the
ones who don't have connection

950
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,190
and don't have any means of
connecting to the classes.

951
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,760
And for that, we have tried
out different strategies.

952
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,400
For example, there
is an institution

953
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,980
with which we did an alliance.

954
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,290
And they said, OK, we
will send you the kits

955
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,340
that you can do tutoring,
who have connection,

956
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,350
and then we're going to take
care of the rest because we--

957
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,360
many institutions they
want to cover, maybe--

958
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,500
I don't know-- 10,000 kids, but
they won't have the staff to do

959
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,320
it anyway.

960
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,850
But they say if JANN take
9,000, then we can take care

961
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,850
of the last 1,000.

962
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,690
So that's something
that we have tried.

963
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,350
Another thing we have tried
is making an alliances

964
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,630
with phone companies
so that they

965
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,350
can give at least free
credits so that the kids can

966
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,730
log into their classes.

967
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,770
Right now, we haven't
finalized any of that,

968
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:50,510
but we are pushing
to try to do that.

969
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,218
I don't know if you
want to add anything.

970
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:54,260
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES:
Yeah, during the pandemic,

971
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,630
we had an amazing experience
of teachers in the Sierra

972
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:01,130
in Puebla, who they themselves
paid for satellite internet

973
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,320
so that students could connect
from the school internet.

974
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,110
So this is something
that we also

975
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,180
see since the
pandemic ended, there

976
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:11,220
is more potential for students
to go to public spaces,

977
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,300
to libraries, to the
schools themselves

978
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,000
and use their resources
there and also maybe

979
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,370
even connect with friends
who do have the resources.

980
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:23,960
But there are definitely some--

981
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,510
like a population that
we keep a lot in mind

982
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,650
and where we're trying to
make efforts to include them

983
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,853
in the benefit of the tutoring.

984
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:35,270
MEGAN MITCHELL:
What about other--

985
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,970
are there other unintended
consequences that you've

986
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,950
specifically designed or you,
kind of, anticipated that you've

987
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,690
designed for or things
you worry about that

988
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:53,520
might have the opposite effect
of what your intention was

989
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,895
of access or I'm just--

990
00:49:55,895 --> 00:49:58,825

991
00:49:58,825 --> 00:50:00,200
BERNARDO GARCA
BULLE BUENO: So we

992
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,140
always worry about the safety
of the kids, for example.

993
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,360
For that reason,
we try to have--

994
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,760
we do interviews
to all the tutors.

995
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,110
And of course, they
are short interviews,

996
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,600
but there have been cases when
if we see behavior that we think

997
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,980
this person doesn't seem
ready to be teaching kids--

998
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,200
I think just one or two
times it has happened--

999
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,220
we decide to tell them that
we don't think there will

1000
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,870
be a good fit for the program.

1001
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,230
And then also even for
the safety of the tutors,

1002
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,780
because one never knows.

1003
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,560
We ask that all the
classes are recorded,

1004
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,410
so there is full
transparency, and they

1005
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,670
are uploaded in the cloud.

1006
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,820
And we have access
to all those classes.

1007
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,530
And so that's another point.

1008
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,140
And the last one
I think where we

1009
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,090
try to be careful
with our population

1010
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:47,840
is that we also ask parents
that whenever it's possible,

1011
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,550
whenever the kid is taking
the class in the same house,

1012
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,730
there is an adult in the same
room just listening over,

1013
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,750
making sure that the
tutoring is go as expected.

1014
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,910
And I think with these filters,
we haven't had any problems

1015
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:01,433
so far.

1016
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,600
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES: We
have, but we have got them

1017
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,460
in time if that makes sense.

1018
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,420
Yeah.

1019
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,450
No, but and also I would
add that maybe another thing

1020
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,530
in terms of
automatization, like, yes,

1021
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,710
we have thousands of
participants using a platform.

1022
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,710
And this platform
is very automatized,

1023
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,580
and we don't see many
of the processes.

1024
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,000
So we always need to
keep this human component

1025
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,860
where participants
can reach out and be,

1026
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,510
like, the platform
is making something

1027
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,260
that doesn't make sense to me.

1028
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,410
And maybe sometimes it
is because they inputted

1029
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,940
the wrong information
or because we

1030
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,490
didn't think of the
exact specific case

1031
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,740
that this tutor had.

1032
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,625
Like, they changed universities
midway, or I don't know.

1033
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,850
There are so many cases.

1034
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,350
And something that
we have realized

1035
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,410
is the more that the
program scales, the more--

1036
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,370
so these cases that
are at the beginning,

1037
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,180
like, maybe 10 tutors have this
problem, the moment the program

1038
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,208
is 10 times as big it
becomes 100 tutors.

1039
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,750
And then we think
about this problem,

1040
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,560
and we integrate
it to the platform.

1041
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,000
So when we say-- when we talk
about sharing the platform is,

1042
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,660
like, we have this, we have
done this iteration process

1043
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,230
of finding the functionalities
that really suit the tutors

1044
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,990
and reducing the--

1045
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,420
or maybe making the platform
more robust to all types

1046
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,700
of occurrences that can happen.

1047
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,070
And we know that they are
not covering all the time.

1048
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,690
So we still have
this human component,

1049
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,500
which allows us to improve the
future versions of the platform.

1050
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,120
So it's very important
to maybe empower the user

1051
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,820
to give a channel
of communication

1052
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,550
for them to point out
mistakes in the platform

1053
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,480
so that we can work on them, no.

1054
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,860
And this is what it makes--

1055
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,300
makes it a good platform.

1056
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,390
I think also it reflects
that we are constantly

1057
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,220
integrating the feedback that we
get from the people who use it.

1058
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:47,835
And that's why it's becoming
better if it makes sense.

1059
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:48,960
MEGAN MITCHELL: Absolutely.

1060
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,473
Yes, Bill, please.

1061
00:52:50,473 --> 00:52:51,640
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Sure.

1062
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,145
I've got a question for Cerine.

1063
00:52:53,145 --> 00:52:56,090
You're going to be reaching
students in Tunisia,

1064
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,380
but do you have plans
to extend your program

1065
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,970
to students in other countries.

1066
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,130
CERINE HAMIDA: Yes, absolutely.

1067
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:08,630
So we actually already have
plans for a near-term expansion

1068
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,950
in Morocco and Western African
countries and have already

1069
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,310
started initial talks to
introduce 1for1 to Latin

1070
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,130
America.

1071
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,880

1072
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,380
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
That's great.

1073
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:27,880
And a question for
Salome and Bernardo.

1074
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,995
You're going to be--

1075
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:32,210

1076
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,840
your application of AI, which
you're obviously working on,

1077
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,010
is identifying-- as you
told us, identifying

1078
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:45,170
best tutoring approaches with
an aim to set up, kind of, best

1079
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,060
practices for your tutors.

1080
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:52,250
How do you plan to bring
that new knowledge developed

1081
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:56,227
through your machine learning
approach to the tutors?

1082
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:57,310
How is that going to work?

1083
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:59,723

1084
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:01,390
BERNARDO GARCA BULLE
BUENO: I think you.

1085
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,765
SALOME AUGILAR
LLANES: Think this

1086
00:54:02,765 --> 00:54:04,670
is like a very ambitious
research agenda,

1087
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:06,370
but it has a lot of steps.

1088
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,960
The first one is what you
were saying like this.

1089
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,680
This is a data driven approach
of letting the data speak.

1090
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,370
We know who--
which of our tutors

1091
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:17,720
were more effective
on their students.

1092
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,930
And we're following
two approaches.

1093
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,810
We're using the
transcriptions of the classes

1094
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,090
as well as the
frequencies of the classes

1095
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:29,180
to identify patterns that
are related to good teaching.

1096
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,140
That's the first step.

1097
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,365
But this is all correlations.

1098
00:54:32,365 --> 00:54:34,240
And we don't know if
it's going to be causal.

1099
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,200
The second step will be to make
sense of these correlations

1100
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,180
and of these patterns
that we're identifying

1101
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,620
and try to translate them
to teaching practices.

1102
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:46,060
So maybe, for example, by
changing some scenarios

1103
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,135
and trying to see if these
changes in scenarios is related,

1104
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:52,700
but now not changes
in frequencies

1105
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,460
but actual what
were the words said

1106
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,830
or what was the pronunciation
or how did the tutor interact.

1107
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,330
So that's the second step.

1108
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:03,860
Then the third step will be to
design an intervention where

1109
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:08,210
we can share this knowledge
with a share of our tutors

1110
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,390
and then run an RCT and
test whether actually

1111
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,670
these practices helped.

1112
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,540
So the RCT is a randomized
control trial where half

1113
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,180
of the tutors would have this
additional information that we

1114
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,260
gained or extracted
from the recordings,

1115
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,020
and half of them wouldn't.

1116
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,550
And then we will test if
it's actually working.

1117
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,760
And if it is, then we
think this training

1118
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,800
would be the way that
we would, like, then

1119
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,470
start sharing this training with
all the tutors instead of just

1120
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,620
the randomized sample.

1121
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,620
Yeah, I don't know if you
want to add something.

1122
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,995
BERNARDO GARCA
BULLE BUENO: No, I

1123
00:55:39,995 --> 00:55:41,930
think that's a really
good description of how

1124
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,817
we're going to use AI to
make our tools better.

1125
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:46,400
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
So you're going

1126
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,330
to move to a train the tutors
kind of effort once you

1127
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:50,870
develop--

1128
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,903
as you develop the
best practices.

1129
00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:54,320
SALOME AUGILAR
LLANES: Yeah, there

1130
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,370
is a potential to do like a--

1131
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:02,580
so it depends on how
we end up doing it.

1132
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,760
But there's a potential
to give tutors

1133
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,480
feedback on their own teaching,
show them their own recording

1134
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,330
and be like, look, there are
these metrics that you could--

1135
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,760
if you meet them, then
you could emulate what

1136
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,360
a very effective tutor is
doing, so like real time--

1137
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,120
not real time because that would
be very stressful for the tutor,

1138
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,330
but at least a feedback
on their own recordings.

1139
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,680
But I think that is
still some years ahead.

1140
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,870
So we haven't finalized
that those details,

1141
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,870
but we see the potential
of doing that for sure.

1142
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,822

1143
00:56:34,822 --> 00:56:36,030
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN: Great.

1144
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,830
Thank you.

1145
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,850
MEGAN MITCHELL:
I'd like to know,

1146
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:44,670
you are clearly all
very talented people.

1147
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,550
What was the inspiration?

1148
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,630
Why is this what you've
chosen to spend your time on?

1149
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,245
What's the origin story
of how you got here?

1150
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:54,860

1151
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,950
CERINE HAMIDA: So
I can take that.

1152
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:02,010
So for me, I've always been
passionate about education,

1153
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,390
and I believe that it is
the empowerment tool, not

1154
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:10,490
just an empowerment tool,
but the one, the big one.

1155
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:15,050
And a couple of years back, I
got to see some PISA results

1156
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,380
and really was shocked
how Tunisia performed.

1157
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,100
That led me to ask
questions, and I eventually

1158
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,500
discovered a lot of
issues, many of which

1159
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,770
I talked about at the
beginning of my presentation.

1160
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:31,040
And when you see issues
that are that big,

1161
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,380
you want to find a
solution for them,

1162
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,770
especially it was
in education, which

1163
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,050
was really important for me.

1164
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:41,955

1165
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:43,330
BERNARDO GARCA
BULLE BUENO: And I

1166
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:49,520
think for us, the story of
JANN started in the pandemic.

1167
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,310
I think also, as
Cerine is saying,

1168
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,840
there was this big problem.

1169
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:57,210
And Salome had a friend working
at the education ministry.

1170
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:01,590
And he told her one day, OK,
they allowed us to do an RCT,

1171
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,470
but they will spend $0 on it.

1172
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,960
But you can do
whatever you want,

1173
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,020
and you will have the support
of the education ministry.

1174
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,930
And it was such a great
opportunity to say,

1175
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,730
let's do something
for the pandemic.

1176
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:20,310
There is so much knowledge saved
in the heads of people locked up

1177
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,280
in their houses.

1178
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,610
Let's just make them
together and make

1179
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,560
this a win-win for everyone.

1180
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,780
So I think that's the
story of how we started.

1181
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,040
And I think, personally,
I don't the--

1182
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,550
well, I have some
ideas, but each of us

1183
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,350
has different motivations.

1184
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:42,150
I think personally for me
it was finding a way that--

1185
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:46,420
I have always loved
programming and finding a way

1186
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,800
to do something that will
help people using a skill that

1187
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,320
sometimes feels very
disconnected from society

1188
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,200
was amazing.

1189
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,840
And it's something that I
have loved for a long time.

1190
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,300
And I don't know Salome.

1191
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,960
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES: I would
say for me, I have thought--

1192
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,590
I have given tutoring
and also worked

1193
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,970
in social services
with children.

1194
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,350
And I think something that
has been very important for me

1195
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:16,420
is that this moment where
children realize make this ahh

1196
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,460
sound of I understood.

1197
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,190
And suddenly this thing
that was so, so challenging

1198
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,190
and that I didn't understand and
I didn't know how to approach,

1199
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,520
it's approachable.

1200
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,410
I can do it.

1201
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,530
It's actually interesting.

1202
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,080
Like, changing this
mindset of it's impossible

1203
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,570
and it's something
I will never be

1204
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,540
able to do to it to this
is actually entertaining

1205
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,990
and I like it and
I can share it.

1206
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,740
And I feel like
anyone who likes math

1207
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,200
would want to have someone
who doesn't like math

1208
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,720
sit down and be like, let
me show you why it's cool

1209
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,010
because I think it's cool.

1210
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:50,050
And so I think sharing
this with children,

1211
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,852
for me, that was
something super important.

1212
00:59:52,852 --> 00:59:54,310
And I guess the
other part was also

1213
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,770
like when we grew
up in Mexico, Mexico

1214
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,360
has given us so many things.

1215
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,300
And then suddenly be thinking,
like, I went to the US.

1216
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,130
I'm pursuing my degree.

1217
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,090
I'm being successful.

1218
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,030
And I'm like leaving
my country behind when

1219
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,718
I know it has so many problems.

1220
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:10,010
And I really want to give back.

1221
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:14,590
So JANN has been like
an opportunity for us

1222
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:20,170
and for me to be here and still
be super connected to Mexico

1223
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:24,040
and still be like it makes
sense that I came here.

1224
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:31,540
So yeah, it's something very,
very nice and very good feeling.

1225
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,460
MEGAN MITCHELL: I can see
Cerine nodding in agreement.

1226
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,990
I think that connection
back to recognizing the

1227
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:40,600
how fortunate you were and
the opportunities you had

1228
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,120
and realizing this
is your chance

1229
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,850
to help keep moving people
forward and pay it forward,

1230
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,410
give back, pay it forward.

1231
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,420
So I really-- I love that.

1232
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,820
I love that.

1233
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:56,350
But in our conversations
before and you've

1234
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,930
alluded to it throughout,
you aren't doing this alone.

1235
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:05,200
Partnerships really seem to
be at the key of scaling.

1236
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,600
Have you thought about those--

1237
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,300
at the earliest stages
important, but then

1238
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,020
also, as you move forward,
were those fortuitous?

1239
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,241
Did you plan some of those
partnerships, or did they--

1240
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:22,800
how have you thought
about navigating

1241
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,220
the types of organizations
you want to be working

1242
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:30,400
and how you structure
that type of relationship?

1243
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:37,270

1244
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:42,070
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES: OK, if
you want, we can start, Cerine.

1245
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:45,210
I guess, if someone
asked me, I feel

1246
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,230
like JANN is the result of
a collage of all the people

1247
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,320
who have helped us.

1248
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,530
I feel like we just
were knocking on doors

1249
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,300
and being, like,
we imagine this.

1250
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,890
And people would be
like, I imagine it too.

1251
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,880
So I can make something--
like, move something

1252
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,030
so that this happens.

1253
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,020
So it's like it's
just the result

1254
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,200
of so many people
believing in the solution

1255
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,370
and working towards
the solution.

1256
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,242
And we are just, like, the faces
in the front, who have been

1257
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:13,450
knocking on all of the doors.

1258
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:16,840
But for instance, the first time
that we implemented the program,

1259
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,960
we were matched with the
director of Technical Primary

1260
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,020
Schools in Baja, California,
which his name is Wenceslao.

1261
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,500
And he was the one who contacted
the first universities,

1262
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,940
and he was the one who gave
us the list of children.

1263
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:33,910
And he was pushing for
it in the government.

1264
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,540
And because he did that, we had
a letter saying, like, we can

1265
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,520
do this in other governments
and come and knock

1266
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,760
and other governments
and be like,

1267
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,170
look what Baja, California did.

1268
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:43,840
You just need to do this.

1269
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,910
And on our side, we were
like providing the platform.

1270
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,840
So it's really been a
teamwork of so many people

1271
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,170
that have helped us.

1272
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,650
And I feel like
something that I think

1273
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,740
is being open-minded,
talk to people,

1274
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,200
understand what they're doing,
see if you can collaborate.

1275
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,640
And even if you can't, I think
I always give people in my mind

1276
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,470
and try to connect them to other
people who they could help.

1277
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:07,420
I feel like--

1278
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,140
I think, again, just part of
forming connections, but really

1279
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,970
connecting people can
bring things forward,

1280
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,960
if that makes sense.

1281
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,340
CERINE HAMIDA: Yeah
and absolutely agree.

1282
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:25,960
Even for us, it was crucial
for us to work with teachers

1283
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:30,130
and to understand the
specific needs of students

1284
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:31,220
and the curriculum.

1285
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,480
So we have a big group of
teachers working with us

1286
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,210
to understand the
students, to understand

1287
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:40,720
how we need to develop
the curriculum for them.

1288
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,450
Also so two things, like,
the context of the student

1289
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:48,820
but also understanding how
exactly we can help them best.

1290
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,910
This will differ when we're
going to Morocco, for example,

1291
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:53,810
or other countries.

1292
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:56,920
Every specific country
has its own context,

1293
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,550
and you can't do
that by yourself.

1294
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,430
You have to partner
with people that

1295
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:03,885
understand the context well.

1296
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:05,260
BERNARDO GARCA
BULLE BUENO: And I

1297
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:10,360
think we'd like to add
something last to our answer.

1298
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,490
Because I think, as Cerine says,
we cannot do this by ourselves.

1299
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,420
This effort of bringing
education and all the people

1300
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,210
here who work in education
know that it's such an effort,

1301
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:27,370
that even with our 7,000 tutors,
we cannot begin covering all

1302
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:30,470
the educational needs we've
seen in Latin America.

1303
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:37,600
So now talking about the future
of our initiative, what we're

1304
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,270
trying to do in
JANN right now is

1305
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,050
exactly what Salome was saying.

1306
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:44,060
We have done this software.

1307
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,050
We have this know how that
allows any institution

1308
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,800
with a team between
two to four people

1309
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,570
to run a huge scale program
in their own communities

1310
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:58,100
and start making a change.

1311
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,560
And for us, it has
been really motivating.

1312
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,280
Speaking with many
institutions in Latin America

1313
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,780
and in the world,
how they say, I

1314
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,090
want to bring this
to my country or I

1315
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:10,860
want to bring this to
my state or my city.

1316
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,530
And that's exactly what
we're trying to do now.

1317
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:18,470
Let's just give that
last piece of product

1318
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,897
that they need to actually turn
this from an idea to a reality.

1319
01:05:22,897 --> 01:05:24,980
I don't know if you want
to add something, Salome.

1320
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,650
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES: Yeah,
because there's the willingness

1321
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,352
to do something.

1322
01:05:28,352 --> 01:05:29,810
Like, there's
passionate people who

1323
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,650
want to do something
about education,

1324
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,180
who want to help our children.

1325
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,930
And we think we
have this tool that

1326
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:38,630
can allow them to do
what they want, like,

1327
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:41,390
to design their own
tutoring program to impact

1328
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:45,530
their own community in the
way that they know best.

1329
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:50,990
And we just would step in the
part of let's lower the cost

1330
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:56,810
from building this from
scratch to a very low

1331
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,970
because we can
provide this know how.

1332
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,820
We accompany the universities
or the institutions

1333
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,440
who want to organize
these programs.

1334
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,320
So I think we are in the
stage of planning this.

1335
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,030
Like, as Bernardo was saying,
this will be like the next step.

1336
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:15,170
And so adapting our software to
be used by other institutions

1337
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,550
and maybe like writing
down this know how

1338
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,917
and being able to share it.

1339
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:22,375
MEGAN MITCHELL:
Yeah, Bill, please.

1340
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:25,098

1341
01:06:25,098 --> 01:06:26,640
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Let me ask you

1342
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,880
a question, first, of Cerine.

1343
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,200
You've set up a
company, not an NGO.

1344
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,850
And why do you think a company
approach is the right answer

1345
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,280
for what you're doing in
Tunisia and then potentially

1346
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,580
in North Africa?

1347
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:47,250
Why did you pick that as
opposed to an NGO approach?

1348
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,680
CERINE HAMIDA: Yes,
it's because of what

1349
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,080
students are looking for.

1350
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,350
So almost every
student in Tunisia,

1351
01:06:55,350 --> 01:07:01,590
Baccalaureate student is doing
something in addition to just

1352
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,100
going to their private school.

1353
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:08,490
Either they're paying for
private or group tutoring,

1354
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:14,370
or they're on other one size
fits all edtech platforms.

1355
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:17,070
It's really a cultural thing.

1356
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:22,270
Everybody is paying
for some service,

1357
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:26,640
whether it's in person
tutoring or online.

1358
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,950
And so we didn't
want to introduce

1359
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:32,460
the idea of just NGO
or a different model

1360
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,880
because that would be
confusing for students.

1361
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,000
They're used to already
the system of companies

1362
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,400
offering these services.

1363
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,870
So this is just related to
culture more than anything.

1364
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,887

1365
01:07:46,887 --> 01:07:48,470
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Thanks, Cerine.

1366
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:55,300
CERINE HAMIDA: And one other
thing is that to be able to--

1367
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:03,370
we are a company, obviously, but
we also want to have some kind

1368
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:09,100
of NGO-like initiatives and
something that we're going to be

1369
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:14,170
doing as we launch actually is
offering 1,000 subscriptions

1370
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:17,529
for free for students in need.

1371
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:19,700
So we're doing a
little bit of both.

1372
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,946
But officially,
we are a company.

1373
01:08:22,946 --> 01:08:24,529
WILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN:
Thanks, Cerine.

1374
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:30,840
And Salome and
Bernardo, you've told us

1375
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,899
about using your machine
learning approach

1376
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:36,210
and your vast
stock of recordings

1377
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:38,279
to identify best practices.

1378
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:41,600
And you're in the
process of doing that.

1379
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,370
Do you have any--
can you hint some

1380
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,020
of the best practices for us?

1381
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,540
Can you give us a glimpse
of what you're starting

1382
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,146
to see as best practices?

1383
01:08:50,146 --> 01:08:51,979
We're running out of
time, so this will just

1384
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:53,874
have to be the top couple.

1385
01:08:53,874 --> 01:08:58,080

1386
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,399
SALOME AUGILAR LLANES: Yeah.

1387
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:06,460
So I guess, I think I
would start by saying,

1388
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,200
like, this is very early
stage research agenda.

1389
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,270
So we don't have any
conclusive information yet.

1390
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:16,390
But the RCT Bernardo
mentioned is very,

1391
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:22,250
I think, shed some light on
the results that we might find,

1392
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:26,200
which is we tested the impact of
social and emotional education

1393
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,029
on the learning of children.

1394
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:31,990
And what we observed
was that children

1395
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:35,470
were asking more questions,
that classes were being longer,

1396
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:38,529
that they were being more
exchanges between tutors

1397
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:39,439
and students.

1398
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:44,649
So we think that this
component of these interactions

1399
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:46,640
that students feel
comfortable in the class,

1400
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,410
that the tutor is able to
provide an atmosphere where

1401
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:55,490
the student trust themselves to
ask questions is very important.

1402
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:59,170
And the key will be to
understand how and in which

1403
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:02,890
moment they are able to
create this atmosphere, no.

1404
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,360
And something that is very
important that we are also

1405
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,660
going to test in the follow
up RCT social and emotional

1406
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,160
learning.

1407
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,805
So what we did, we
had a group that

1408
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,180
had social and
emotional learning

1409
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,370
and another one
that had history.

1410
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:15,258
Both were learning
math, and we observed

1411
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:17,300
that the group with social
and emotional learning

1412
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,590
learned more math and
significantly more.

1413
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:23,930
So the question now is like,
OK, but we treated both students

1414
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,820
and tutors simultaneously,
so we don't

1415
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:28,940
know if the tutors gained
skills, emotional skills

1416
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,330
to connect with students.

1417
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,960
If the students gain the
emotional skills to deal

1418
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,570
with frustration
and learn and be

1419
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:39,560
more able to manage the
difficulties of learning math,

1420
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,120
or was it that through the
social and emotional learning

1421
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,640
activities where they shared
personal details of their lives,

1422
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,940
they shared anecdotes,
they suddenly like

1423
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,340
recognized each
other, formed rapport

1424
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,500
and formed that connection.

1425
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,200
And now the tutor cares more
about this specific student,

1426
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,900
and this student
cares more about what

1427
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,490
the teacher is teaching
because they like them.

1428
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:06,240
And then that's why they
were observing math benefits.

1429
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:11,000
And these three channels have
huge policy implications,

1430
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,580
and they differ a lot, no.

1431
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,080
So it's very important
to understand

1432
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,130
which channel is in place.

1433
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:23,090
And so, yeah, I guess this
could be like a one step

1434
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:27,780
towards understanding what
makes a good teaching strategy.

1435
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:32,117

1436
01:11:32,117 --> 01:11:33,200
MEGAN MITCHELL: All right.

1437
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:39,580
Well, I mean, I had such great
inspiration, so much energy

1438
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:43,160
from both teams and
both organizations.

1439
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,410
I think you've given us a lot
of great things to think about

1440
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:51,040
and to look forward to
seeing where you bring where

1441
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,260
you take these organizations.

1442
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:58,150
And certainly, we'll keep
folks informed and aware

1443
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,210
of what you're doing.

1444
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:02,930
And if there's things we can do
always to support you at J-WEL,

1445
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,460
please don't hesitate to ask.

1446
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:09,700
Thank you all very much
for joining us today.

1447
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,790
And I hope you have
enjoyed this conversation

1448
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:14,630
as much as I know I have.

1449
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:18,120
Have a wonderful morning,
afternoon, evening,

1450
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,370

BERNARDO GARCA BULLE
BUENO: Thank you, everyone.

1453
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:23,958
It was really great.

1454
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,000
