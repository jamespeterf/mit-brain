1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,279
let us look at an application of the

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,080
probabilistic method to extremal set

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,039
theory the extremal set theory concerns

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,480
the study of families of sets that have

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,960
certain desirable properties and asking

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,920
questions such as what is the largest

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,039
set family that you can have with such

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,040
with such properties and in this video

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,840
we'll focus on the following property of

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,280
being an intersecting family this means

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:45,600
a collection of sets A1 through a l such

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,079
that these sets pairwise intersect in a

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,000
non-empty intersection okay so we want

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,800
sets A1 through a l such that whenever

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,640
you take any two of these sets and take

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,120
their intersection it is never the empty

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,760
set so here are two basic questions that

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,560
one can ask the first one which will

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,759
turn out to be an easy warmup is what is

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,479
the largest intersecting family of

21
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,200
subsets of 1 through n so here there are

22
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,040
in total two to the N subsets of 1

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,640
through

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,439
n but if I want to only keep a

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,640
collection of sets that's an

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,720
intersecting family what is the largest

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,920
family I can get and the second question

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,640
which will turn out to be far more

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,040
interesting and will involve an

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,040
application of the probabilist method is

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,399
a question what is the largest

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,119
intersecting family of K element subsets

33
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:42,399
of 1 through n so here n and K are

34
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,159
inputs to the question so they are given

35
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,360
and we're asked to find what is the

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,000
largest intersecting family of K element

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,079
subsets of 1 through

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,159
n all right so the first question as I

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,200
mentioned earlier turns out to be a

40
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,039
fairly easy one and we'll solve it as a

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,200
warmup so as an example just to

42
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,439
illustrate what we're talking about if

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,439
we look at all

44
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,439
sets

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
containing the element

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,360
one well this collection of sets is

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,800
intersecting because they all have the

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,760
element one so every pair intersects in

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
some set that contains the element one

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,319
in particular non

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,879
empty this collection of sets has size 2

52
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,239
to the n minus one because once you fix

53
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,319
the element one the other elements can

54
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,159
be in or not in the sets and they're two

55
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,680
to the N minus one such possibilities

56
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,560
right so a binary choice for each the

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,159
elements outside

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,599
one okay now this is just an example but

59
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,599
it turns out this is the best that we

60
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,599
can do

61
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,080
because okay so the claims that we

62
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,519
cannot do better or we cannot get an

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,040
even larger set

64
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,040
and this is because for

65
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,360
every subset a of 1 through

66
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,879
n and

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,959
most one of

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,840
a and the complement of

69
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,560
a so the elements 1 through n subtract a

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,040
so the complement of a and most one of

71
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,040
these can be

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,799
in the intersecting

73
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,319
family so what we're doing here is

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,159
pairing up the sets with their

75
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,920
complement and because it's an

76
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,840
intersecting family you cannot

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,560
simultaneously have a set and its

78
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,760
complement in this intersecting family

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,840
and so this

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,760
eliminates so this means that you can

81
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,040
have at most half of all the two to the

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,239
N sets thereby showing that this 2 to

83
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,239
the N minus one is indeed the best that

84
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,880
you can

85
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,239
do okay so this

86
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,759
finishes part one question one and now

87
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,800
let's move on to the more interesting

88
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
and harder question

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,840
two again let's start with some

90
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:35,280
examples first here's

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,680
a easy case if n is less than

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,360
2K

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,000
then okay so this is the easy setting if

94
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,600
n is less than 2K then by pitching hole

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,280
principle any pair of K element subsets

96
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,199
of 1 through n intersect so we can take

97
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,400
all n choose K

98
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,400
sets and they form an

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
intersecting family

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,600
okay so there's nothing really to do

101
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,919
here because we can just take all the K

102
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,360
element

103
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,120
sets so the harder part of the question

104
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,680
the more interesting part is what

105
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,280
happens when n is at least

106
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:25,039
2K here as an

107
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:25,039
example we can take as earlier all sets

108
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:34,840
containing the element one

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,479
and this gives us n minus one choose K

110
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,240
minus one

111
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,360
sets Okay and as before these sets they

112
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,600
all this set form set this collection of

113
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,440
sets form an intersecting family because

114
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,199
any pair their intersection contains the

115
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,080
element one and is thus

116
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,800
nonempty right so this is a construction

117
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,120
it gives you n minus1 choose K minus one

118
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,400
sets but is this the best you can do

119
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,319
right perhaps through some other methods

120
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,560
of construction through other examples

121
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,000
maybe there are even larger intersecting

122
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,960
families of K element

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,440
subsets that turns out not to be the

124
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,360
case and that is the main theorem that

125
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,960
we'll prove in this video and this

126
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,960
result is known as the aish C rle

127
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,960
theorem

128
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,840
so this is a seminal and a beautiful

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,800
result in extremal set

130
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,199
theory and the ERS cor theorem says that

131
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,199
if n is at least

132
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,199
2K

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,280
then

134
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,960
any

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,720
intersecting

136
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,879
family and we give this family a name

137
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,520
curly

138
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,520
F of sub

139
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
sets of 1 through

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:15,080
n okay subsets um

141
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,080
and any intersecting family of K element

142
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,240
subsets of 1 through n

143
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:34,199
has

144
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,199
size at most n minus1 choose K minus

145
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,360
one in other words the construction that

146
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,800
we gave just now is indeed optimal you

147
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,919
cannot get a bigger intersecting family

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,919
of K element subsets of 1 through

149
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,199
n let us now prove the erors corado

150
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,800
theorem and we'll introduce Randomness

151
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,120
into to the problem and use the uh use

152
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,759
some beautiful ideas from the

153
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,759
probabilistic

154
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:13,680
method so here's how we start the

155
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
proof let us

156
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,199
order the numbers 1 2 3 and so on

157
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,800
through n

158
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,800
randomly around a

159
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,159
circle okay so what do I mean by this

160
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,039
take a

161
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,080
circle and then basically take a uniform

162
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,760
the random permutation of 1 through n

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,680
and then place the

164
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,320
numbers around the circle in the order

165
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,320
of that permutation so for example I'm

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,959
putting down nine numbers here n equal

167
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:58,839
to 9 in some circular order chosen

168
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,839
uniformly at random

169
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:07,079
missing a number here six right so here

170
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,279
nine numbers okay uniformly around the

171
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:13,560
circle and let us

172
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,560
call a

173
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,079
set subset of 1 through

174
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,600
n

175
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,600
contiguous I'm here I'm

176
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:31,519
defining term

177
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,800
contiguous call this subset contigous us

178
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,800
if its

179
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,240
elements the way they're ordered around

180
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,240
the circle form an

181
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,040
arc in this

182
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:57,800
ordering so for

183
00:09:51,160 --> 00:10:01,320
example the set of numbers 4 3 9 5 this

184
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:08,160
Four Element set is

185
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,160
contiguous so 3 4 5 9 is

186
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,079
contiguous because the orders they're

187
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,079
according to the circular ordering these

188
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,680
four numbers form a contiguous block on

189
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,800
the other hand the set 1 three is not

190
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,360
contiguous because they do not form a

191
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,800
contiguous

192
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,959
block okay so that's just a

193
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,959
definition and now for a

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,639
given set sub a a subset of 1 through

195
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,639
M

196
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,680
with K

197
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:49,160
elements so for a given K element subset

198
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,360
of 1 through n what is the probability

199
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,160
so here a is fixed a is not random so we

200
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,959
given this a what is the probability

201
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,959
that a is contiguous

202
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:08,560
okay so the ordering Is Random so given

203
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,160
a set what is the probability that under

204
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,880
this random ordering is

205
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:19,279
contiguous well let's think about

206
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:22,839
that so the ordering is random but here

207
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,959
if a has K elements can think about how

208
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:31,240
many different ways these K elements can

209
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,240
be placed around the circle

210
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,920
there are n different

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,399
positions from where geometrically this

212
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,880
K length K Arc lies and once you fix

213
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,800
that

214
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,440
position the

215
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,720
probability

216
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,760
that the elements the K elements of a

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,760
actually falls into the desired

218
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:02,800
positions

219
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,800
is 1/ K one over and choose

220
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:13,519
K okay so this is the probability that a

221
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,920
is a contiguous set under this random

222
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,720
ordering and

223
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:25,199
now by the linearity of

224
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,199
expectations the expected number of

225
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,160
contiguous sets

226
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:39,560
in this collection

227
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:42,079
f is equal to the size of f times the

228
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,440
probability that each individual set is

229
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,360
contiguous and that was calculated

230
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:51,880
earlier to be this quantity so n / n

231
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,880
choose

232
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
K on the other hand

233
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,480
the property of f being

234
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:23,639
intersecting a claim implies that in any

235
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:27,360
given circular ordering there are at

236
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,360
most K

237
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
contiguous

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,040
sets

239
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,639
for so in a

240
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,639
given circular ordering okay so let's

241
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,199
pause and think about why this claim is

242
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,360
true if I give you an

243
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,639
ordering and ask well how many

244
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,639
contiguous sets can there be and now

245
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,639
this sets these contiguous sets they

246
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,759
have to be intersecting right so if we

247
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:04,880
have one set so here let me denote the

248
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:08,320
elements these circles as think about

249
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,279
them as positions on the circle so these

250
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,639
dots as positions on the circle so if

251
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,560
that's one set well where can the other

252
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:20,680
sets be well they have to intersect this

253
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:24,519
block so maybe another set is like this

254
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,320
one but if that set is in then it

255
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,360
excludes if this blue set is in then

256
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,839
excludes this green set from a

257
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,839
possibility and so

258
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,880
on right

259
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,279
and okay so you see that given that this

260
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:00,160
red set is

261
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,959
in well at most one of the blue and

262
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,680
green on the second line can be in and

263
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,600
the most one of the blue and green on

264
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,279
the third line can be in and the most

265
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,279
one of blue and green on the fourth line

266
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,199
can be in and these are the all the

267
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:16,079
possibilities of how another contiguous

268
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:18,560
set can intersect the the red set so

269
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,720
that's an argument that can translate

270
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,040
into this claim that F being

271
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,000
intersecting implies that most K

272
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,639
contiguous sets in any given

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,639
order okay so this argument is very

274
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,600
analog to the argument that we did at

275
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,319
the beginning where we pair up

276
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,000
complimentary sets but this time we're

277
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,959
only looking at contiguous sets that

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,560
intersect a given

279
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,800
set

280
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,880
okay well if you can only get at most K

281
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,399
contiguous sets in any given order then

282
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,240
this quantity which is a random variable

283
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,240
it is always at most

284
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,240
K so in it's expectation then this

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
quantity that we got at the end is also

286
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,000
at

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
most

288
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:15,199
K

289
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:17,040
thus the size of f is at most K Over N

290
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,639
time n chose

291
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,160
K which one can then expand the binomial

292
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:29,160
coefficient to see that the final

293
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:33,399
quantity is equal to nus1 choose K -1

294
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,399
one and that's exactly what we

295
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,199
claimed all right so this finishes the

296
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,560
proof of the ERS corado theorem which is

297
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,880
a foundational result in extremal set

298
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,480
theory and it's a beautiful application

299
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,160
of the probabilistic method to extremal

300
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,160
set theory and to combinatorics in

301
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,240
general where we start with a claim a

302
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,040
theorem that is not random at all it is

303
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,160
completely deterministic it's about

304
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
finding the maximum possible set size

305
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,079
the size of something that satisfies

306
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,880
some constraints and yet the proof goes

307
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,959
by introducing new Randomness into the

308
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,439
setup that allows us then to derive this

309
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,439
beautiful conclusion
