1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,519
Thank you and good morning everybody.

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,920
Let me start this again.

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
Thank you and good morning everybody.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:24,080
>> Good morning.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:26,800
>> Two out of 10 to be not great. So um

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,359
I'll try to cover all this in half an

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,600
hour. I had to just before the talk to

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,040
take some slides out because I was told

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,559
it will be half an hour. Anyway, so we

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,280
start what what I call when we deal with

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,920
disruptions and resilience

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,879
the anacarina principle. What is the

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,360
anacarina principle? To wrote happy

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,680
families are all alike. Unhappy family

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,000
are each unhappy family is unhappy in

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,800
its own way. And you know every

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,440
disruption to supply chain to to the

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,159
economy comes in its own its own way its

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,880
own causes its own its own effect. No

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,720
two are the same. But turn out that

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,040
management of risk involve prevention

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,760
detection response. There are generic

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,720
preparation step that are good for most

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:25,040
type of risk most type of of disruption.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,080
If you open a book on risks, the first

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,880
thing that you'll usually see is

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,880
two-dimensional classification.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,000
People try to prioritize what to respond

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,720
to by trying to see what event what

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
disruption can how likely it is to come

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,200
and if it comes how bad it's going to

32
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,040
be. So usually they do you see it in

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,720
every risk book they usually do the

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,759
disruption probability and the

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,600
consequences if it happen it can be say

36
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,000
probability or likelihood go from low to

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,759
high the consequences can be light or

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
severe and they put that's just example

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,119
they put all kind of events in order to

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,600
think about how to prioritize

41
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,160
and in most book you'll find something

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,720
like this it's called heat map and they

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,000
say the most the things that you should

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,000
pay attention to are the things that are

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,239
high probability and bad consequences.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,920
The only problem with this is that it's

47
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,560
actually wrong because what you have to

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,640
worry about are these things. The things

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,000
that are very low probability and high

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,760
risk or severe consequences.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,879
These are the so-cal black swans

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,720
Talib in his book called it black swan.

53
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,239
black swan were you know European

54
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,680
thought that black swans don't exist

55
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,480
until they found one in Australia. So

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,760
these are the the risks that you don't

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,440
anticipate and the reason that it's not

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,360
that you should not worry about the

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,920
risks that are high probability and and

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,000
and large consequences but you can

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
identify them if it's a high probability

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
they happen to you they happen to your

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
competitors they happen to somebody

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,959
already and you can prepare response and

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,720
you can drill because you can prepare

66
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,200
for them. The problem with this uh low

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,879
probability is that you don't know what

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,239
to expect. And just an anecdote after

69
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:28,239
911, the Pentagon hired fiction writers,

70
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,560
sci-fi fiction writer to start to

71
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,519
imagine what will be the next attack

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,480
because they were caught

73
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,120
unprepared so to say. And you can for

74
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,159
this you can prepare you know what we

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,159
call general general response.

76
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,239
The the term resilience is actually

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,440
taken from material science is the

78
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,840
ability of of a metal or other material

79
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,080
to retain its shape after deformation.

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
When we talk about business resilience

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,560
or organization resilience we're talking

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
about the ability to get back to its

83
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,000
prior

84
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,319
performance prior KPI. it it could be

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480
manufacturing, it could be customer

86
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,239
service, whatever.

87
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,840
So I actually

88
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,199
that was in my first book and my second

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,359
book I added another dimension because

90
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,280
these are the two the two dimension we

91
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,280
talk about but I added another

92
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,240
dimension. This is the detectability,

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,160
the time from you get some information

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,440
that something is happening until it

95
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,320
actually hits. And

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,320
this is how long it takes from sensing

97
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
to impact.

98
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:46,000
This axis is different than the other

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,639
two. Usually I ask my students why. So

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm not going to embarrass anybody. It's

101
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,000
different because it has a negative

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,040
part. This axis has negative part which

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,440
means some events can be realized only

104
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,880
after the fact you don't realize them

105
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,960
before you know. So what you can realize

106
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,840
after the fact is you industrial

107
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,199
espionage somebody stole the plans for

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,240
the next great product the some pathogen

109
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,240
sleeping pathogen you know

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,160
let me say a word about it the most when

111
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,800
we do simulation of what can destroy

112
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,320
societies it's not a nuclear bomb in New

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,039
York Harbor actually it's a pathogen

114
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,520
that does not show any symptom until the

115
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,520
entire population is infected

116
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:40,080
In fact, COVID 19 had some of this.

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,240
COVID 19 was infectious when people did

118
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,320
not show any symptoms. In fact, there's

119
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,479
a whole I wrote a whole book about it

120
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,080
and it's about supply chain during

121
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,000
uh COVID 19. And there were German

122
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,080
scientists, a woman German scientist

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,800
that scream bloody hell that people are

124
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,400
infected without showing symptoms.

125
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
the French government, the Swedish

126
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
government, the American government, all

127
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,960
men laugh at her said it cannot happen.

128
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,520
It's against all men. Only the only

129
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,960
problem is she was right. Of course, a

130
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,960
cyber agent, you know, when somebody

131
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,360
attack your systems and you find it only

132
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,600
later. Somebody stole all customers uh

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,600
data

134
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
something immediate tsunami center that

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,919
tsunami all around the uh uh the sensor

136
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,000
all around the Pacific coast and when

137
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,360
there's a tsunami there are actually

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,039
alarm throughout the beaches from

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,759
Vancouver to the southern tip of Chile

140
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,360
and when something is being detected the

141
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,319
alarms going on to get people off the

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,280
off the beach This can be between five

143
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,160
seconds and two hours depending on where

144
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,000
the tsunami is over few hours.

145
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,240
Short-term of course weather forecast we

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,039
can know within two three days. Uh

147
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,240
medium-term can be deteriorating labor

148
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,680
relationship strike might might come

149
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,639
superior competition some Nokia thinking

150
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,199
that a computer company will never

151
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,360
develop a product that can be

152
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,400
competitive.

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,599
The result is going from 67% worldwide

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,520
market share to 3%.

155
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,039
Um

156
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,120
then there's long you can think about

157
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,520
long term um aging of the population now

158
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,560
happening in the United States happening

159
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,599
in many other country you know the the

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,240
number the replacement number is 2.1

161
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,080
children per woman at 2.1 children per

162
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,919
woman society stays about the same

163
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,120
level.

164
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,560
South Korea is a 0.8.

165
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Within one generation, they're going to

166
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,479
be half their size.

167
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,000
China already reached peak, but that's

168
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,080
because of the one child policy. Uh

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,879
southern Europe is not in good shape,

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,280
and the United States now is not in good

171
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,440
shape. It it used to we are now at 1.7

172
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,960
or so. We used to be above above two.

173
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,960
A global warming, of course, and there

174
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,919
are other long long-term effects. And of

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,759
course the dangers are

176
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,319
the more immediate it is the more

177
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,560
dangerous it is. And if it's long-term

178
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,240
there's actually an opportunity a

179
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
business opportunity and you can even

180
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,479
think about climate change many many

181
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,720
business opportunity built into into

182
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,160
climate change. I we can talk about it

183
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
later.

184
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,760
So

185
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,519
many companies invest in what's called

186
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,959
visibility

187
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,440
trying to see what's coming down because

188
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,440
they allow if you sense problem early

189
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839
the earliest you sense a problem the

190
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,640
better you can response

191
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,839
so how do you prepare you know you

192
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,200
prepare option for for the respondent

193
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,279
you multisourcing for example again I'm

194
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,200
not going to spend a lot of time I'm

195
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
trying to run quickly leave maybe two

196
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,600
minutes for questioning. So you can

197
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,080
either if you look at this you can

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,519
either do you can either have a

199
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,120
you know if you have one supplier you

200
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,920
better have very strong relationship

201
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,440
with them. If you have if you don't it's

202
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,959
expensive but if you don't you have you

203
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
better have multiple suppliers. That's

204
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,160
what this is this is trying to show. Of

205
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,399
course keeping emergency inventory

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,080
something that companies are now trying

207
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,800
to do.

208
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,920
What we have now is a lot of apps that

209
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,880
do supplier mapping that you know where

210
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,880
the and this is not easy because knowing

211
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,279
where the supplier is. You need to know

212
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,519
where the supplier's factory is not when

213
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,720
the headquarters if you go into the SAP

214
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,640
system you see where you send the check.

215
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,839
That's not where the where the action

216
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
is. You need to know where all the

217
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,720
plants are. But anyway, there's a um

218
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,880
there are apps to to um to find out if

219
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,480
something is going on there and then a

220
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,440
lot of it is in news, a lot of it in

221
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,279
other but the trick is what people what

222
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,880
some companies did they tied the bill of

223
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,600
material

224
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,160
to this risk. So they know that if

225
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,399
something happen in northern Italy, this

226
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,320
supplier plant that makes this part is

227
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
going to be out of commission and this

228
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
parts going to this products and this

229
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
product going to these customers. So we

230
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,640
better alert the customers and customers

231
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,320
can be alerted within seconds that

232
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,399
something has a problem.

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,920
uh flexibility of being able to move

234
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,600
fast and there are many elements of

235
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
flexibility you know whether it's cross

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
trainining whether it's a

237
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,839
standardization you know all interplant

238
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,600
are standardized

239
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,760
being able to collaborate have good

240
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
relationship with other companies and I

241
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,079
can talk about at length about all of

242
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,320
this the problem with talking to half an

243
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,839
hour is I'm trying to summarize six

244
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,640
years of research and four books into 30

245
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,480
minutes so I missing some part. Um,

246
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,600
postponement we'll talk about in a

247
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,240
minute. And culture,

248
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
what do you mean by culture?

249
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,360
Flexibility. Culture is the ability to

250
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,640
speak truth to power. The ability to

251
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,279
move information to decision making very

252
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,120
quickly.

253
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,120
Another element is having decision

254
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,279
making close to the action. So the

255
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,320
frontline people can make can take

256
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,480
action without going all the way up.

257
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:37,839
This is this does not only happen in

258
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:41,120
um in crisis. One company is very good

259
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,160
in this is Zara.

260
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,200
Quick example few years ago Madona had a

261
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,959
concert in Barcelona.

262
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,279
Three weeks later, she had a concert in

263
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,120
Madrid, and all the young women in the

264
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,160
audience were wearing the same outfit

265
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,200
that she wore in Barcelona. Within three

266
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,600
weeks, Zara was able to redesign, send

267
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,760
it to manufacturing. It's all local, and

268
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,839
send it to stores.

269
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,399
It would have taken Marks and Spencer

270
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,600
about 10 months to do something like

271
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,120
because there was no the young designers

272
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,040
who were there had the right to do it.

273
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,839
And the trick is of course in all of

274
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,320
these things is praising them when right

275
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,560
but never punishing people who are in

276
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,480
the front line when they're wrong.

277
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,360
Difference to expertise it's another

278
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,959
thing that expertise

279
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,680
trump

280
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:41,519
um rank. So if you are on the

281
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,279
tower in uh in JFK and it's foggy and

282
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,240
it's rainy and there two pilots who

283
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,760
hardly speak English around you.

284
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,800
Suddenly you see something amazing

285
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,279
happen. Suddenly the controllers stop

286
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,120
listening to the FAA managers. They're

287
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,200
starting to ask questions of the veteran

288
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,399
controllers people who are there for a

289
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,880
long time. Experienced Trump's rank.

290
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,839
This this is happening in nuclear power

291
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,720
plants. It happened in many high-risk

292
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,880
environment. It happens in the military

293
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,120
and good organization understand and

294
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,440
encourage it and conditioning for

295
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,120
disruption. I mean the organization

296
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
airlines airlines are conditioned

297
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,200
disrupted all the time. So honestly they

298
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,800
get used they simply get good at it at

299
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
responding.

300
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,959
Um

301
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,440
the essence of flexibility is

302
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,399
interchangeability. For example, all all

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,760
interplant are the same. Basically, uh

304
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,360
it started from the old days of um

305
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,320
making chips when getting a good yield

306
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,320
out of a wafer or getting a bad yield

307
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,839
out of a wafer is the difference between

308
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
making a lot of money and losing a lot

309
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,920
of money. So once they got it right,

310
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,440
management say copy these suckers around

311
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,600
the world and you know partsization that

312
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,320
anyway lots of examples here. I can go

313
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,760
more of these the product standatization

314
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
the example here is the difference

315
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,399
between the treat you know you can order

316
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,560
Mercedes E-Class in Germany not in the

317
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,800
United States in 3.9 trillion

318
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,760
combinations you can order it any way

319
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,560
you want so think about when you have a

320
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,680
recall you don't know which car you have

321
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,160
by comparison Honda Accord which sell by

322
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:29,839
the way a lot more cars than um than

323
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,880
Mercedes has only 529 combinations

324
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,720
um pliable people people are basically

325
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,560
cross trains and many examples of this

326
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,040
postponement is something that

327
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,800
I have several examples I'll talk only

328
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,720
about one Tom Brady my favorite

329
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,720
quarterback

330
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
retired unfortunately for those in the

331
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,440
United States you know what you're

332
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,199
talking about um

333
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,399
you know you don't know at the beginning

334
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,920
of the

335
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,360
which team and which player

336
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,440
will catch the fancy of the fans. So you

337
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,519
make basic

338
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,199
basic jersey they make in in Costa Rica

339
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,839
and some of them they they come with a

340
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,279
color of the team.

341
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,320
No, almost none come with a name because

342
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,800
what happens is they send it to a center

343
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,720
in Indianapolis and then only once the

344
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,800
season starts and they see what's going

345
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,440
on, they finish it. So it costs more but

346
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,320
it sells a lot more.

347
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,320
Anyway, many more example. You know the

348
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
basic of crisis management is having an

349
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,480
emergency management center

350
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,880
concentrating all information decision

351
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
making one place and communicating a lot

352
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,759
if theo don't or anybody not

353
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,000
communicating to the market to the to

354
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,720
the communities to the analysts people

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,680
will assume the worst decision making

356
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,160
authority you know and protocol you know

357
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,759
in many risks companies look like

358
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,839
children playing soccer everybody's

359
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,279
running after the ball everybody's

360
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,519
trying to help And GM had a term for

361
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,560
this. He says swim your lane just do

362
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,759
your job. Don't don't interfere. And in

363
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,800
my books I have many other examples when

364
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,279
you know senior VP came and had you know

365
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,839
made all kind of decisions that were

366
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,560
screwing up the whole the whole system.

367
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,560
Uh look at suppliers

368
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,560
review the product and customer. You

369
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,920
have to make decision ahead of time. If

370
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,360
you don't have enough to build the

371
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,920
product for all the customer who gets

372
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,320
the product and what and it's better

373
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,560
done before the crisis not under the

374
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,880
gun. Uh finance of course if there's a

375
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,079
recession or problem you know cash

376
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,399
becomes king and people start

377
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,959
you know lengthening the term of payment

378
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,680
to uh to supplier putting them putting

379
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,720
them at risk. People reduce the number

380
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,280
of stocking unit. So for example,

381
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,280
General Mill during COVID went from 90

382
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,079
variety to 50 variety. This does two

383
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,559
good things. First of all, it keeps the

384
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,400
the best sellers on the shelves and

385
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,079
second, it reduces cost because you have

386
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,079
less changeovers. So

387
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,000
planning for the recovery, you know,

388
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,559
it's a

389
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,559
it's really crisis are an awful thing to

390
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,640
waste. You find out who are the good

391
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,799
suppliers, who are the good customers,

392
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,440
who are the good employees. Some of

393
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:41,600
today's issue we talk about tariffs

394
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,400
and I explain let me skip this I

395
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,640
explaining why trade in the first place

396
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,799
and we can talk about it but let me let

397
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
me skip it for for for the sake of time.

398
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,039
It's a simple example that shows that

399
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,240
even if one country is better than

400
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,280
another country in everything,

401
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,080
they should still trade. They can both

402
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,880
get advantage from from trading.

403
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,840
So the reason for the current tariffs

404
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,799
are pretty clear. Um other countries

405
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,120
mainly China did take advantage of the

406
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,120
United States. That's a you know whether

407
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,880
you like tariffs or not you have to

408
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,559
acknowledge that there was problem with

409
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
intellectual property and all kind of

410
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,080
barriers and currency manipulation and

411
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,679
state support. So this administration

412
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,360
decide to do something about the trade

413
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:35,200
deficit was was going through the roof.

414
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,960
So um so what they do decide to do

415
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,960
tariffs however tariffs are problematic.

416
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,360
We all know that reshoring will take

417
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,120
decades. real reshoring of entire

418
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
because you don't reshore just the last

419
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,640
stage of manufacturing you have to

420
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
reshore the entire supply chain between

421
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,720
the supplier and their supplier their

422
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,120
supplier their supply takes decades um

423
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,720
the US does not have enough workers does

424
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,160
not have enough factory workers so who

425
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,760
is going to manage who's going to work

426
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,840
in all these factories then of course

427
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,520
tariffs create gets more tariffs it it's

428
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,840
there's always retaliation and

429
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,840
retaliation to the retaliation. The

430
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,480
stickiness some companies like it

431
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,400
because they their competitors are now

432
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,280
tariffs and their costs are higher so

433
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,679
they can increase cost. It can lead to

434
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,960
inflation, loss of product quality. If

435
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,559
you don't if you don't have to compete

436
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,240
worldwide,

437
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,640
quality over time will go down. Uh

438
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,400
possible recession. Not even clear that

439
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,400
tariff will help because reduce imports

440
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,559
there will also be reduced export

441
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,960
because companies because other other

442
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,240
countries will respond and then what we

443
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:55,039
see now is dumping when Chinese is

444
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:58,559
particular China huge manufacturing uh

445
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,280
capacity creates a lot of extra stuff

446
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,880
that is dumped all over

447
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:08,799
um creating problem. The uncertainty is

448
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,840
of course the major problem. Um this is

449
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,760
this is more a slide for some of your

450
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,520
supply chain manager how how you deal

451
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,559
with the tariff when when you have to

452
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,480
pay attention to it. There's a after

453
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,240
several processes it it goes to the

454
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
custom and border protection page.

455
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,280
That's the only page that counts.

456
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,120
everything the white house said and all

457
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,679
this don't pay any attention because

458
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,880
this exactly show what is the tariff on

459
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,440
exactly what product and at what rate

460
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,360
and then the question is who should

461
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,520
carry the burden the supplier the the

462
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,360
company the customer the retailer you

463
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,320
know China warned Walmart against

464
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,919
pressing Chinese suppliers and Trump

465
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,159
warned Walmart against raising prices so

466
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:55,520
a little problem

467
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:58,240
um again some some idea on how on how to

468
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,400
deal with some of this some of these

469
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,080
problems.

470
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,000
The one thing that I want to emphasize

471
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,559
here is the last point, guard customer

472
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,799
trust. Companies who raise prices

473
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,360
because they can

474
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,520
uh have are in danger of losing customer

475
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,039
trust. Companies may have to raise

476
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:21,520
prices. If if the tariff goes up by 20%

477
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,919
and Walmart margin is only 4%.

478
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,640
They'll have to do something about it.

479
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,080
But they have to explain it. Explain,

480
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,720
explain and communicate all the time.

481
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,360
So what's next? Uh we'll see what we

482
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,559
call bullip effect. As the tariff is

483
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,679
changing, there's a oscillation that go

484
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,400
through the economy and this is very

485
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,640
much not helpful.

486
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Finally, these are some issues of

487
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,360
concern in general. So, sustainability

488
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,280
may becoming a luxury good. When time

489
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,440
gets tough, people stop paying

490
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,400
attention. Of course, the polarization

491
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,240
of everything. Inequality is growing

492
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,280
now. We see it in the United States. We

493
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,480
see it in in other country. Some people

494
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,720
living large. You know, some stores are

495
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,320
doing great. Yet some people are voting

496
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,640
for Mandi in uh in New York because of

497
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,039
the lack of affordability.

498
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,200
The rise of populism and nationalism

499
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:27,600
that's you know the examples galore all

500
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,360
over. I even include Mandani here. Um

501
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,320
industrial concentration it's a

502
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,720
long-term issue. The media which with

503
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,000
fake news is now going to be a huge

504
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,400
problem with AI. the next pandemic which

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,919
may be which may be more contagious and

506
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,440
deadlier.

507
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:51,600
Uh to me for the United States the most

508
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,200
worrisome issue is the lousy level of

509
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,520
there's no other way to describe it the

510
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,320
lousy level of education

511
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,280
in the United States.

512
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,919
You know, you heard from the director of

513
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,600
the industrial leazison program about

514
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:12,000
how great MIT is.

515
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Let me give you a reality check.

516
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,640
I've been at MIT 51 years. I did my

517
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,640
master's PhD at MIT.

518
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,400
We now offer remedial physics for

519
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,919
incoming

520
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,440
incoming students undergrads.

521
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,360
What? At MIT? Yes. Students cannot do

522
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,559
the math.

523
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,039
There is a deterioration of K to2

524
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,799
education. There's a water down of the

525
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,200
SATs.

526
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:49,280
And this does not look good because

527
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,919
the only

528
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,520
The only good start I can tell you is

529
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,840
that we're honestly better than other

530
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:00,240
schools, which is not a great, you know,

531
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,440
you know, not a great thing to say, but

532
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,039
it's true. um

533
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,720
AI, we're still dealing with AI, how to

534
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,840
supplement more jobs and we are in for

535
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,840
huge social changes and the US depth is

536
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,120
just going out of going through the roof

537
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,679
and geopolitical event what may happen

538
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,760
with the you know China, Taiwan, who

539
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,520
knows anyway.

540
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,279
All right, let me stop here.

541
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,480
If you want to read more about what I

542
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,799
do, these are some of my books. And then

543
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,480
there are questions. So I let me read

544
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,360
some of the question are hard. Let me

545
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,039
let me rephrase them. The first question

546
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,559
was

547
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,320
are your books available on Amazon?

548
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,880
Yes,

549
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,760
it's a good question. Um,

550
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,120
how will advances in artificial?

551
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,720
How will advanced artificial

552
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,559
intelligence shape supply chain

553
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,400
resilience? And what new risk might AI

554
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,799
itself introduce to global logistic

555
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,840
networks? The real the real answer is

556
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,559
who the hell knows? The problem is I'm

557
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,960
now writing a book on the actual use of

558
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,760
supply chain, the actual use of AI and

559
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,520
supply chain. And it's a problem. The

560
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,360
train is running faster than I can

561
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,159
write.

562
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,480
The technology is moving so fast and

563
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,720
things that six months ago I said this

564
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,520
will not happen. This this is a hurdle

565
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,240
that are now taking place. So it's very

566
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,320
hard hard for me to answer but we see a

567
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,240
lot of automation,

568
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,039
autonomous vehicles, autonomous

569
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,159
warehouses, you know, dark stores, a lot

570
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,960
of these things that work with very few

571
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,840
people. I just landed in Barahas airport

572
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,080
in Spain over last last weekend. Just

573
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,679
came back.

574
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,760
I was stunned. The jetway that comes to

575
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,880
visit to uh to to meet the plan is

576
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,880
robotic. There's no person there. It

577
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,360
just comes that they had a red light

578
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,200
that shut right into the little hole

579
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,279
that the stewardist look through to

580
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,679
decide when to open the door. Then

581
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,360
suddenly it turns green. They open the

582
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,120
door and it fits like this. There's no

583
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,640
step or anything. It's the only airport

584
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,120
in the world that has it. But I was

585
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,080
looking at the future right there. So

586
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,520
they are they didn't want to answer me.

587
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,760
I went to the to the Barahas airport to

588
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,559
the the management asked how many people

589
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,360
work in moving the jetway. Find out how

590
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,240
many people no don't talk we will

591
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:44,480
reassign them. Reassign them to what? I

592
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,159
mean nobody had an answer. The answer is

593
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,640
some people are going to lose their job.

594
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:54,000
Some pe many jobs are going to change

595
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,760
but some people are going to lose it. Um

596
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
what can university bridge the gap

597
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,799
between theoretical advances in supply

598
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,960
chain analying and the practical

599
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,400
industry partner? Glad you who asked

600
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,159
this question. Best question because you

601
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,400
got you know an advertisement for the

602
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,000
industrial as an office. Now let give

603
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,799
you the the advertisement to the people

604
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,320
who work in the salt mines to the people

605
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,640
who actually do the work. We are the

606
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,360
center for transportation logistics. We

607
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,080
are funded unlike large part of MIT 85%

608
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,000
of our funding comes from companies. We

609
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,640
work directly with companies. Our

610
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,640
students that do the thesis, master of

611
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
PhD, they have to work with a company.

612
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,799
They have to to use real data.

613
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,320
Understand that real data does not come

614
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,520
in nice spreadsheet style. You have to

615
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,279
clean it. You have to work with it. You

616
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,400
have to understand it. You have to be

617
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,279
realistic about it. So we are absolutely

618
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,399
an element that bridges the gap in our

619
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,320
in our area. We by the way as long as we

620
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,080
do advertisement I didn't plan on it but

621
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,480
why not? Um we have our own industrial

622
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,559
lean office. We have 50 companies. We're

623
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,520
not as big as the ILO. We have 50

624
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,440
companies and usually

625
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,200
membership in the industrial lean office

626
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
is for the techn the the chief

627
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,960
technology officer or the technology

628
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,520
people. Our member are the chief supply

629
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,000
chain officers of all these companies.

630
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,159
We have some of the same companies and

631
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
lots of others

632
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,679
around the globe and we work with all of

633
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,360
them. They are students. We we do

634
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,720
masters and PhD. We don't do

635
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,240
undergraduate centers at MIT do not do

636
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,240
undergraduate. They just do graduate. So

637
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,559
we have

638
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,640
it's a big it's the it's the the unknown

639
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,200
biggest secret at MIT. Just give you

640
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,799
some statistics. We have we have an

641
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,279
online program in supply chain

642
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,880
management. We have 1.4 million

643
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,120
learners.

644
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,760
Every country on earth excluding North

645
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,320
Korea. North Korea we didn't break it.

646
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,640
Nobody from North Korea. But every other

647
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,799
country in the world we have we have

648
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,320
people who work in refugee camps who

649
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,480
take it on the phone. So it's huge

650
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,919
impact. We have centers around the world

651
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,080
that we start. We have a whole network

652
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,279
of centers around the world. We have our

653
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,760
own as I say education program. We have

654
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,559
our own um ILO type

655
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,279
thing. So this was a good question that

656
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,919
gave me the opening to give an

657
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:34,880
advertisement for CTL. If you want to

658
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,880
talk to us, you can find us of course

659
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,279
CTL, Center for Transportation Logistics

660
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,159
at MIT. You can find my name Sheffy.edu.

661
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,960
Just send me an email and we'll be happy

662
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,399
to talk to you. Let me stop here.

663
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,799
>> No, you can go through a few more

664
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,320
questions.

665
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,600
>> Oh, I can go through more of question.

666
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,600
Absolutely. Um,

667
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,880
what can we learn from supply chain

668
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,799
resilience approach to determine ways to

669
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,799
manage workforce planning in the coming

670
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,799
turmoil?

671
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,919
I have I actually have an answer for

672
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:13,440
you. Amazing. I have part of my group. I

673
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,640
have three students who develop together

674
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,919
we develop of course based on AI. We

675
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,760
develop a system that predicts which

676
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,159
jobs are going to be eliminated, which

677
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:29,520
jobs are going to be augmented by all

678
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:32,720
kinds of AI. So this is a

679
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,600
and it's a self-learning system. We just

680
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,159
did it with we so we developed it and

681
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,320
and and gave a theoretical presentation,

682
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,000
but some companies got excited. The

683
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,679
first company that got excited was the

684
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
US the Texas Department of

685
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
Transportation.

686
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,000
And they are wonderful to work with

687
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,279
because they don't care about privacy.

688
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm just they send us database that I

689
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,200
was oh my god anonymize it immediately.

690
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,039
I don't want I don't want names of

691
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,320
people and to have it you know on our

692
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,279
computers but it's wonderful to work

693
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,559
with them and we are working with them

694
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,679
over time to see first of all to check

695
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,360
our forecasts which jobs are going to be

696
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,120
eliminated which jobs are going to be

697
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,840
changed and they are very progressive if

698
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,000
I may say this word about Texas very

699
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,559
progressive

700
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,080
agency See, they really want to become

701
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,159
better. They want to understand how to

702
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,200
work. They want to understand how to

703
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:41,039
augment the jobs, what kind of uh um

704
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,440
what kind of uh upgrading or education

705
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,279
they should give. This is the

706
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,720
interesting thing is of course we use

707
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:52,159
very sophisticated AI to get into this

708
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,919
and some huge databases the the the US

709
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:59,760
labor labor department has in order to

710
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,240
create this type of uh uh of forecast.

711
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,399
We are now doing it for

712
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,679
three companies

713
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,440
doing it you know

714
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,840
getting paid for do it. So we are

715
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,679
improving the algorithm every time we do

716
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,440
another another implementation. Of

717
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,440
course

718
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,440
um

719
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,080
I applaud my I applaud my company that's

720
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,159
a good start somebody like what they

721
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,919
work with I applaud my company for

722
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,000
developing long range view of the future

723
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,600
in a similar fashion to your research. I

724
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,200
find much of the qualitative work

725
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,240
though. Yes. Yes. That's my reason

726
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,480
that's exactly my personal work and

727
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,960
others I

728
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,360
if you look at my books I work on many

729
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,519
many areas. I don't work in one area.

730
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,480
They're kind of all tied to supply chain

731
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,640
all with application to uh to supply

732
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,640
chain. But that's exactly the question

733
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,080
that we looked at. You see all these

734
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,960
estimates that are either based on

735
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:06,799
anecdotal evidence or economists making

736
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:10,320
pronouncement but there is no underlying

737
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,240
mathematical rigor. Now honestly at this

738
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,000
point I don't want to claim that

739
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,159
mathematical rigor is better than the

740
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,159
best economics

741
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,600
best economist professor in the world

742
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,519
but uh but it's true. No I'm at least

743
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,360
you have something to I'll tell you

744
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,679
what's the difference. The difference

745
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,760
when you have a structured algorithmic

746
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,480
process is you can make it better and

747
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,320
better all the time because you get more

748
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,919
data, you get more experience, you get

749
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,519
it better and better and better all the

750
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,799
time. As it runs, it gets better

751
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,840
automatically. So it it it learns from

752
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:47,679
itself and embeds this learning in what

753
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,720
it does. That's part of the magic of the

754
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,120
new AI. So

755
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,320
yes, we do it.

756
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,720
But I should say

757
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,200
data is still a problem. For example,

758
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
just some of the database is taken from

759
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,039
the New York Times. The New York 20

760
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,679
million records in the New York Times,

761
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,320
people talking about

762
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:15,359
what will happen to uh you know to jobs

763
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,839
and some and stories. So we took a lot

764
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,520
of these stories about people losing or

765
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,399
not losing or changing the job. We had

766
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,919
the same type of data from agency France

767
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,679
in in in it's the the Reuter of France.

768
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,639
Um

769
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,359
we have and had huge data sets of the

770
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,159
several data sets of the um labor

771
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,879
department and actually we look at it

772
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,040
just to explain because you ask we look

773
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,200
at the elemental unit is not a job it's

774
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,480
a task. So we know at every jobs the the

775
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,960
this labor department said every job has

776
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,599
multiple tasks and they talk about task

777
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,800
at the job. We look at what task may be

778
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:00,560
augmented and then we can aggregate it

779
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:05,359
to jobs to to to industries to companies

780
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,839
to states to countries whatever. So what

781
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,000
we can do because of this just a simple

782
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,800
example so we look at the two jobs and

783
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,040
say we this job is going to lose three

784
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,440
tasks and this job is going to lose two

785
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,720
task maybe in the future there'll be one

786
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,280
job but this is not only oneonone it's

787
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,520
kind of around the whole the whole

788
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,480
component so we reoptimize

789
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,480
everything so

790
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,000
as I said it is still the problem is

791
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,599
that the the technology technology what

792
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,599
people actually use is moving so fast on

793
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,240
and also there's a big difference

794
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,320
between when as I say when everything's

795
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,760
said and done in this area a lot more is

796
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,160
said than done so

797
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,720
my current book which I'm working on is

798
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,240
seeing what's actually being done and is

799
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,280
there ROI on this you know MIT had had a

800
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:04,079
report that said only 5% of the company

801
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,760
can see any ROI in AI implementation

802
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,800
Maybe I don't know we are checking we

803
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,200
are getting some different uh different

804
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,760
results but it it's hard to get because

805
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,160
it's very hard for a company on an

806
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,960
interview to say yeah we spend you know

807
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,960
a few million dollars but we got nothing

808
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,320
for it. There are not too many

809
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,880
executives that are willing to say

810
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,480
something like this in public. So this

811
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,280
is who knows what it exactly but we are

812
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,720
trying trying to work at it and get

813
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:39,880
there. Anyway,

814
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,880
let me stop here. Thank you very much.
