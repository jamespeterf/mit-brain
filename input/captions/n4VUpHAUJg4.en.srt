00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,970
Welcome to the 2025
Gardener Lecture.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,770
I'm Julie Shah.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,090
I'm the department
head here at AeroAstro.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,660
And this is a very exciting
event that we hold each year.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,490
And so thank you so much for all
coming out to be a part of it.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,820
The Gardner Lecture is
made possible by a bequest

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,300
of the late Major Lester D.
Gardner, a member of the MIT

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,440
class of 1898, to sponsor
annual presentations

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,450
on aeronautical history.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,890
He was an air officer
in World War One.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,860
And he was the recipient of
numerous aeronautical awards,

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,310
including the Daniel
Guggenheim Medal in 1947,

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,360
given for the citation for
Outstanding Achievement

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,930
in Advancing Aeronautics.

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,905
He had a long and
storied career.

17
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,280
He established a
publishing group

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,370
that's responsible for a number
of major aeronautical trade

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,060
publications, including the
predecessor to Aviation Week.

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,250
And he was also the
founder of the Institute

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,640
for Aeronautical
Sciences, which eventually

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,040
evolved to become our AIAA.

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,890
Major Gardner's interest
in MIT and our department

24
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,870
continued throughout his life.

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,200
And it lives on not only in
this Gardner Lecture, which

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,580
is a big, important event
for us in the department,

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,620
but also in the
Hunsaker professorship,

28
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,240
which he helped to establish.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,120
And in his honor, we
continue the tradition

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,100
of hosting the Gardner
Lecture to celebrate

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,040
our history and our field,
and to keep looking ahead

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,370
by looking up.

33
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,000
And so over the years,
our Gardner Lectures

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,600
have included Grover Loening;
Igor Sikorsky; Yvonne Brill;

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,260
Neil Armstrong; Robert
Seamans, Jr.; John Langford;

36
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,920
Pam Melroy, just to name a few.

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,930
And so with that incredible
history under our belts,

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,710
it's my great pleasure
to welcome and introduce

39
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,510
this year's Gardner
speaker, Dave Limp.

40
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,860
Dave is CEO of Blue Origin,
a private space company

41
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,620
founded by Jeff Bezos, with a
vision of millions of people

42
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,480
living and working in space
for the benefit of Earth.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,320
And as you all know, the company
builds reusable rocket engines,

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,070
launch vehicles and space
systems and lunar landers.

45
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,460
So Dave joined Blue
Origin as CEO in 2023.

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,240
And he also serves as the board
chair for Blue Origin's Club

47
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,030
for the Future, which is a
nonprofit organization dedicated

48
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,280
to inspiring and mobilizing
future generations

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
to pursue careers in STEM.

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,260
Dave has previously been
at Amazon, since 2010,

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,740
where he oversaw the
development, retail sales,

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,740
and operational aspects of
Amazon's consumer electronics

53
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,390
devices and the
services behind them.

54
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,400
So, including Alexa,
Echo, Kindle, Fire TV,

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,660
Ring, just to name a few, as
well as other initiatives,

56
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,730
such as Project Kuiper.

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,100
And many MIT alumni have gone
on to work at Blue Origin.

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,680
And we've also had quite
a few research payloads

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,570
launch on Blue Origin's
New Shepard rockets.

60
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,280
So now, with Dave at
the helm, Blue Origin

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,540
is exploring increasingly
ever more exciting

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,300
missions and aerospace
engineering challenges

63
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,980
that are truly at the
cutting edge of spaceflight.

64
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,350
And he's here today to
tell us all about it.

65
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,750
So please join me
in welcoming Dave.

66
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,914
[APPLAUSE]

67
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:11,820

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,790
Thank you.

69
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,635
Thank you, Professor Shah.

70
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,930
I hear the previous
speakers on this

71
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,110
and the quote from Wayne's
World pops up in my head,

72
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,080
that I'm not worthy.

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,900
So I'm going to do my best
to give you little words.

74
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,400
Hopefully, they inspire
you in some ways.

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,900
This lecture series
goes back to 1959.

76
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,340
And it's just an amazing
honor to be here.

77
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,640
I want to talk
today about how we

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,070
as a collective species,
and specifically this class

79
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,730
and you all, given your
focus on aerospace,

80
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,930
can help build a road to space.

81
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,270
This is a big, really
important mission in our mind

82
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,930
and one that's going to
take multigenerations to do.

83
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,000
But it is critically important.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
And so to plant
that seed, I'm going

85
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,890
to start with a quick video.

86
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,740
And then we can
talk about something

87
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,330
that is seemingly small.

88
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,230
But is the seed that plants
this very, very large vision.

89
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,600
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

90
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,880
- Holy cats, weightlessness.

91
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,540
Oh, Jesus.

92
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,840
[LAUGHTER]

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,570
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,210
Oh, wow.

95
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,440
I can't believe this.

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,690
Everybody in the world
needs to see this.

97
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,165
- Stand by, touchdown.

98
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:40,910
Stand by, touchdown.

99
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,320
- There is Mother
Earth and comfort.

100
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,250
But what you see is black.

101
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,030
Oh, my God.

102
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,070
I hope I never
recover from this.

103
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,240
I hope that I can
maintain what I feel now.

104
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,216
I don't want to lose it.

105
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,630
[LAUGHTER]

106
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,340
What you have given me is
the most profound experience

107
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,800
I can imagine.

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,460
I'm so filled with emotion
about what just happened.

109
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,550
Jesus.

110
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,500
Oh, my God.

111
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,936
It was unbelievable.

112
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:25,360

113
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,820
Oh, I'm telling you--

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,460

115
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,300
[END PLAYBACK]

116
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,710
You saw Bill there.

117
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,710
And there's been
over 700 people that

118
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,680
have gone above the Karman line
and had their version of this.

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,790
I've been super lucky to
meet a number of astronauts,

120
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,080
a pretty significant number.

121
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,710
And Julie and I have
seen a few of them

122
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,150
in some of the same conferences.

123
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,340
And to a T--

124
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,290
I haven't met them
all-- but to a T,

125
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,978
they all have a similar story
to what you just saw Bill have.

126
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:59,270
There's actually a name for it.

127
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,710
It's the overview effect.

128
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,330
And everybody comes
back from space

129
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,470
changed in many different ways.

130
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,350
But one common thread
is this overview effect.

131
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,970
And it's the sense that as soon
as you leave the atmosphere,

132
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,440
you see how thin of a
line there is protecting

133
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,010
this great planet, Earth.

134
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,410
And then you look up and you
see the deep darkness of space

135
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,400
and see how vast it is.

136
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,660
And you come back with a
feeling that Earth is small,

137
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,180
Earth is fragile, and
Earth should be protected.

138
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,790
And we've sent-- with lots of
people in this room's help--

139
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,670
probes to all the moons--

140
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,850
most of the moons-- all the
planetary bodies we've crossed.

141
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,530
And rest assured, the
Earth is the good planet

142
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,630
if you want to live.

143
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,740
And we know that now.

144
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,440
And so our purpose
is to figure out

145
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,550
how to think about
that in that context

146
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,190
and preserve that
which is the Earth.

147
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,470
And to do that, we have
to think about what

148
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,270
has happened over the
past couple hundred years.

149
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,420
If you go back a
couple hundred years,

150
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,320
and you think about almost every
metric that we would measure

151
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,060
prosperity by, life expectancy
is up from 40 to 75 years,

152
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,670
infant mortality is decreased
from 175 deaths per 1,000

153
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,830
to less than 28.

154
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,245
Global literacy is
at an all time high,

155
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,490
highly correlated to prosperity.

156
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,550
Poverty rates are below 10%.

157
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,210
Hunger is at an all-time low.

158
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,460
I could go on and
on and on again.

159
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,710
And you would find reasons why
our lives are incredibly better

160
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,030
than they were.

161
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,740
There's one notable
difference, though.

162
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,860
That notable
difference is, I can't

163
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,370
go down to the Charles
River, ladle up

164
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,490
a good scoop of that
water and drink it.

165
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,030
We've paid the price
of all this prosperity

166
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,790
by using some of the
natural resources that

167
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,750
are on this Earth.

168
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,630
By any dimension,
it's more polluted.

169
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,620
We could argue how
much warmer it is.

170
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,190
But the fact of the matter is,
it's still the great planet.

171
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,680
And our job is to try to
figure out how to preserve it.

172
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,210
And this is the foundation of
our mission statement, which

173
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,400
is, in a simplified way, we want
to take the polluting industries

174
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,110
and move them to space.

175
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,770
And then we can rezone this
great planet of ours, Earth,

176
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,049
to parks, recreation, maybe
a little light industry,

177
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,778
roller coasters, you name it.

178
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,320
But it's going to
be a place that you

179
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,409
can come back and visit.

180
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,820
Some people still live here.

181
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,080
And we'll be prosperous
in space and preserve

182
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,940
that which is the thing
we love about Earth.

183
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,880
So for the next 20,
25 minutes or so,

184
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,510
I'm going to try to paint a
blueprint of the infrastructure,

185
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,893
the key pieces.

186
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:57,060
And they're not all of them.

187
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,143
They're not all-inclusive.

188
00:08:58,143 --> 00:08:59,870
But some of the key
pieces that we think

189
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,860
are critical to invent, to
make this a reality as we

190
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,830
move forward.

191
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,090
So the first thing I would say
is that to get this to happen,

192
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,090
space needs fundamental
infrastructure.

193
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,080
And if you think about the
building blocks of any step

194
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,210
function change, as
you think about how

195
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,740
to get to a big
vision like this,

196
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,080
it is the infrastructure that
you actually think about.

197
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,500
I have a front row seat to this
because I've spent a lot of time

198
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,350
with Jeff.

199
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,030
And Jeff tells the story of
this in the context of Amazon.

200
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,110
So let me tell you that
story about Amazon.

201
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,620
Jeff started Amazon in
a garage in Seattle.

202
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,490
It's just him, a
couple other people.

203
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,092
And yet now you look ahead
and it is your new normal.

204
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,300
What would you do without it?

205
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,940
How would you get
packages delivered to you?

206
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,857
How would you do this?

207
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:54,620
But how does one or two or three
people do this in a garage?

208
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,640
It's because they
had infrastructure

209
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,210
that they could rely on.

210
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,730
They were standing on
the shoulders of giants.

211
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,550
They didn't have to build an
entire transportation network.

212
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,240
There was UPS, there was FedEx,
there was the postal system.

213
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,043
They didn't have to build
new payment systems.

214
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,460
There were credit
card companies--

215
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,570
Visa, Mastercard,
American Express.

216
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,680
All those existed.

217
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,540
So you didn't have
to go build that.

218
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,540
You didn't have to build
that which was the internet.

219
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,740
That was on the backs
of DARPA and Xerox PARC

220
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,480
and a lot of other
research institutions

221
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,980
that had built
this infrastructure

222
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,150
to be able to move bits around.

223
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,650
And so the young entrepreneur
that was Jeff at that time

224
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,570
could focus on building
the application layer,

225
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,930
knowing that all that
infrastructure existed for him.

226
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,850
And we want to do the
same thing for space,

227
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,640
build that infrastructure such
that when your kids' kids--

228
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
it's likely a multi-generation
thing-- wake up and decide,

229
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,980
gosh, I want to do X in space,
they can take it for granted

230
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,720
that all the hard,
heavy lifting is there

231
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,080
and focus on the
application layer of what

232
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,660
they want to bring to market.

233
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,078
So what do we want to do?

234
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,370
I'm going to give you a couple
different infrastructure

235
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,450
pieces, selfishly that
Blue is working on.

236
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,970
But there's lots of other
people working on this as well.

237
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,860
The first is we have
to dramatically reduce

238
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,070
the cost of launch,
specifically, dramatically

239
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,130
reduce the cost of a
kilogram of payload

240
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,110
to the orbit of your choice.

241
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,980
One of the hardest
things here is, in fact,

242
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,150
getting payload to space
in an affordable manner.

243
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,000
Now, we've done this.

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,010
You can go all the way
back to the Apollo program.

245
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,780
And we got a lot of mass
all the way to the Moon.

246
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,360
It came in an incredible cost.

247
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,310
At the peak Apollo,
it was spending--

248
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,050
there's different estimates on
this-- but spending about 2.5%

249
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,680
of GDP per year.

250
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,020
That is an unfathomable
amount of money.

251
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,612
Give me 2.5% of GDP, I will
give you fusion in 10 years.

252
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:02,170
But it's not going to happen.

253
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,540
And even at the end of
Apollo, the American people

254
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,900
got fed up with it.

255
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,698
It was too much of a
drag on the economy.

256
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,490
And it had to be slowed
down and eventually

257
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,040
shut down because it's
unsustainable at those rates.

258
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,060
But you can do amazing
things in space

259
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,660
if you have the
ability to do this.

260
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,410
So our job as this industry,
and certainly at Blue,

261
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,550
is how to take the amount
of price of that kilogram

262
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,910
to orbit and bring it down?

263
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,800
And you can start
seeing this on a curve.

264
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,080
It's a logarithmic curve--

265
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,670
dollars on one axis and
then years on the other.

266
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,510
And you can start seeing where
the knee in the curve happened.

267
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,800
And specifically, where
that started happening,

268
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,990
is when you started to
see the introduction

269
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,610
of reusable rockets.

270
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,617
When you get in your car and you
drive from point A to point B,

271
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:50,450
you don't throw away
your car into the ocean

272
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,510
at the end of the trip.

273
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,690
Similarly, when you get
on a Southwest Airlines

274
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,590
and you fly point A to point
B, they don't scrap the plane.

275
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,900
Yet, for the last 50 years,
except for the last 10,

276
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,750
that is how we treated rockets.

277
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,750
We just got rid of them.

278
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,880
They were disposable.

279
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,220
And so reusability is a key.

280
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,270
And Professor Shah
mentioned that you've

281
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,160
seen some of this in
some of your classwork

282
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,290
because we have a
suborbital reusable vehicle.

283
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,560
And it's incredibly profound
that things like this

284
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,000
are our new normal.

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,050
Just 10 years ago,
this was the thing

286
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,970
that science fiction
was made up of,

287
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,790
that the idea that we would
be landing rockets literally

288
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,740
every other day,
or every third day

289
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,890
right now, orbital,
suborbital, is just

290
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,600
an amazing and profound change.

291
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,290
And this reuse is
completely new.

292
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,090
And on the booster
side, it dramatically

293
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,300
changes the formula.

294
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,990
And as we start thinking
about reusing second stages,

295
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,430
it furthers that formula.

296
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,880
And you can see us
continuing to climb down

297
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,916
that curve that I showed you.

298
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,638
I know this is something
that you, in Course 16,

299
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:02,680
have been studying a lot.

300
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,890
And you've put payloads on this.

301
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,140
So it shouldn't be new to you.

302
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,930
But it's dramatic in its ability
to help us down that cost curve.

303
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,310
The second part of
the cost curve--

304
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,570
anybody know what this is?

305
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,070
No.

306
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,280
Rocket formula.

307
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,132
Rocket formula.

308
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:16,840
There you go, OK.

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,990
Extra credit for you.

310
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,920
I have no grades to
give, but you get it.

311
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,330
So this is--

312
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,760
Tsiolkovsky is often
credited with this.

313
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,880
I think there's some controversy
that it might have been Moore.

314
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,400
But anyway, this is a
very famous formula that

315
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,390
tells us a lot about delta-v.

316
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,160
But one of the most incredible
things that it says is--

317
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,050
it's a function of wet
mass over dry mass.

318
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,190
And it leads you to a lot
of different conclusions.

319
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,660
The one I'll focus on here
today is that it leads you--

320
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,880
that rockets want to be bigger.

321
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,940
As rockets get bigger,
that mass fraction changes.

322
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,880
And every extra amount
that fraction gives you,

323
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,200
we can move to payload, assuming
we're maxing out on payload.

324
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,790
You could argue that some
payload is volume out.

325
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,280
And so we want to
be able to do that.

326
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,110
And that is where the
industry is moving.

327
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,480
We're moving to
ever larger rockets.

328
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,140
It's another place-- it's kind
of amazing how much the Apollo

329
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,973
engineers had right.

330
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,670
I'll talk some more
about that later.

331
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,900
But large rockets have
incredibly good mass fractions.

332
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,850
And you can start seeing that in
the percentage of the propellant

333
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,470
that goes over the payload.

334
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,380
And our rocket, which is New
Glenn, our big rocket-- which

335
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,383
we launched earlier
this year, got to orbit.

336
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:34,300
Haven't landed it yet.

337
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,190
But just hang on to your hats.

338
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,400
Coming soon-- is an incredibly
large rocket by any measure

339
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,560
that we would have been talking
about just five or 10 years ago.

340
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,440
It's 320 feet tall.

341
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,310
It can throw 45 metric
tons to LEO orbit,

342
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,140
which is 13 metric tons to a
high energy orbit like GEO.

343
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,130
So this is an
incredible workhorse.

344
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,130
But more important
than that, it also

345
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,260
has a completely
reusable first stage.

346
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,670
We launch from the Cape.

347
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,030
We land out on a barge about
300 nautical miles offshore.

348
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,170
We barge it back in.

349
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,790
We refurbish it for
a couple of days.

350
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,680
And then we go ahead
and try to fly again.

351
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,770
And it also has--

352
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,910
I talked about that
mass is important,

353
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,000
but increasingly
the amount of volume

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
that you can put up as well.

355
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,510
It gives you more flexibility
to design the payloads.

356
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,110
So our fairing size is 7 meters.

357
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,290
So to give you a sense of
the size of that fairing,

358
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,070
New Shepard, which I
showed you land earlier,

359
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,210
with the nose cone on it, can
fit into the payload fairing

360
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,610
of New Glenn, to give
you a perspective

361
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,620
on the size of this vehicle.

362
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,410
And it's powered by
seven BE-4 engines that

363
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,980
are methalox engines and
optimized for the atmosphere.

364
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,010
And then the upper
stage is powered

365
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,390
by BE-3 engines, which are very
high efficient and optimized

366
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,070
for non-atmospheric work.

367
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,880
So these are incredibly
powerful vehicles.

368
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,720
And when you get to
this size again start

369
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,000
seeing the cost per kilogram
of payload come down.

370
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I would be remiss to
talk about New Glenn

371
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,050
without at least
showing you a launch.

372
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

373
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,630
- There we go.

375
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:19,262

376
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:20,970
- I think it's a big
day for a lot of us.

377
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,217
A lot of us worked
many, many years,

378
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,800
putting a lot of blood, sweat,
and tears to get to this point.

379
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,150
And it's a very,
very awesome day.

380
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,340
- I'm very excited
for the world to see

381
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,240
what Blue Origin is capable of.

382
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,230
- I'm most looking forward to
seeing us safely reach orbit.

383
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,065
And I'm excited to celebrate it
with my team and with my wife.

384
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:43,330

385
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,280
- [INAUDIBLE] set the fire
switch to launch function.

386
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,815

387
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:49,315
Liftoff.

389
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,195
- All seven engines
have full throttle.

390
00:17:57,195 --> 00:18:10,923

391
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,590
- [INAUDIBLE] continues
to perform well.

392
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,780
Now, passes through
max q, [INAUDIBLE].

393
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,240
- We have ignition
and [INAUDIBLE].

394
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,530
Chamber pressure is good.

395
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,570
- GS-2 is now orbital.

396
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:29,680

397
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,740
- As soon as we saw liftoff, we
were like, oh my God, we did it.

398
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,690
We got to orbit.

399
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,475
What an incredible rumble
from the diesel engine.

400
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:41,750

402
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,270
Yeah.

403
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,510
[APPLAUSE]

404
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,310
Never gets old.

405
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,380
You just got to do it
over and over again.

406
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,320
I also love-- the thing about
that video I love is the BE-4

407
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,912
team is like--

408
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:55,870
they see Miko.

409
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,760
And they're just like,
we're done, we're out.

410
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,970
Meanwhile, the BE-3, the Blue
team, the upper stage team,

411
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,470
is just like-- just sweating
bullets trying to get to orbit.

412
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,137
It's OK, though.

413
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:05,637
So what have you
done for me lately?

414
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:06,260
It's great.

415
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,870
[LAUGHTER]

416
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,720
So we talked about
reducing the cost of mass.

417
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,830
That's the first critical
infrastructure thing

418
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,300
that we have to think about.

419
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,940
The second critical
infrastructure thing

420
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,980
I would postulate is how do we
build a hydrogen space economy?

421
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,320
So why do we want hydrogen?

422
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,300
Well, there's a lot of reasons,
but some have come very true

423
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,430
to fruition in the
very recent time,

424
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,500
which is with the
latest exploration--

425
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,450
that's just again all come
about in the last decade or so--

426
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,450
is now we have very
high confidence

427
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,020
that water is on many parts
of the Moon and also on Mars.

428
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,170
And this means you
can just crack H2O.

429
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,060
And we can get both the
fuel and the oxidizer

430
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,810
from hydrogen. And being able
to get that, if you just go back

431
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,410
to the rocket equation, the
mass fraction would tell you--

432
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,460
for all the things that
make this Earth great,

433
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,840
the atmosphere is pretty good.

434
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,670
I like it.

435
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,840
Gravity, 1 G-- kind
of like 1 G, too.

436
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,480
But it's pesky for rockets.

437
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,980
So every time we have to
bring fuel up or oxidizer up,

438
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,250
it's just mass, that if we
could build it in space,

439
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,900
it's so much better.

440
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,620
And so knowing that
we now have water

441
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,230
on Earth-- on the Moon and
Mars and likely elsewhere,

442
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,950
gives us high confidence that
hydrogen was the right choice.

443
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,370
But again, I go back
to the Apollo era.

444
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,270
And they had it right again.

445
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,840
It's amazing how a bunch
of folks using slide rules

446
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,940
had so many design decisions.

447
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,630
But this is another
example of it,

448
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,370
which is that you
really do like to have

449
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,020
a carbon-based first stage
engine-- in our case,

450
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,290
we're using liquid natural gas.

451
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:58,924
But back in the Apollo days,
it was a different propellant--

452
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,620
because you have such
good density from it.

453
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,630
So you can pack a lot
more in your tanks.

454
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,830
And while you're fighting that
atmospheric and gravitational

455
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,290
drag, you can go ahead
and get through that.

456
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,050
However, when you start
getting to upper stages

457
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,170
and you're not
fighting those forces,

458
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,210
you want to try to
get something that's

459
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,840
much, much more efficient.

460
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,300
And when you think
about ISP in an engine,

461
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,090
the actual specific
impulse of the engine,

462
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,150
there's really
almost nothing that

463
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,050
beats the ability to put
hydrogen and oxygen together.

464
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,400
And it just makes sense.

465
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,860
And so we have chosen
that for those reasons.

466
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,730
Now, there's obviously
downsides to this.

467
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,700
I can make a lot of
arguments about why

468
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,470
you wouldn't want
to do this, not

469
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,150
the least of which is they're
entirely different engines,

470
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,600
with entirely different cycles.

471
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,180
So the logical choice, if
you're running a business,

472
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,810
is to just say, OK, I'm going
to take my atmospheric engine

473
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,050
and I am just going to
optimize a vacuum version of it

474
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,400
and I'm going to call it a day.

475
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,940
It's less test stands,
less infrastructure,

476
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,870
less ability to have
things go wrong.

477
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,040
But the right answer
architecturally,

478
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,160
to create a hydrogen
economy, is to have

479
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,790
optimized hydrogen engines.

480
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,060
And we do it not only
in what you see here,

481
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,800
which is-- this is the BE-3U.

482
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,290
That was the upper stage
engines you saw on the video.

483
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,110
And there's two of those
on the New Glenn vehicle.

484
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,580
But we also have a secondary
hydrogen-oxygen engine.

485
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,020
Different cycle, smaller,
10,000 pounds thrust engine,

486
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,810
that we're developing, called
BE-7, that is available--

487
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,400
think of it as the
inter-solar system engine,

488
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,270
to get you around.

489
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,910
So it'll fly our
transporter to the Moon.

490
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,430
It'll power our lander
to land on the Moon.

491
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,720
And it also uses hydrogen
for all the same reasons,

492
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,300
that it's readily available
and incredibly good

493
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,760
in terms of performance.

494
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,810
So what's the other downside of
going to hydrogen and oxygen?

495
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,260
Well, they're stored
at cryo temperatures.

496
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,370
And cryo temperatures
have this pesky thing.

497
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,580
They want to boil off.

498
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,870
And we can insulate them.

499
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,250
We do and we can.

500
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:19,400
But for longer duration missions
in space, traversed to the Moon,

501
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,600
starting to think about
traverses to Mars, that boiloff

502
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,320
as a percentage of--

503
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,560
you can see the numbers
here-- as a percentage

504
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,630
of where you are starts
to add up pretty quickly.

505
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,670
And so you want to figure
out how are there ways

506
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,780
that you can mitigate this?

507
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,650
Again, insulation helps,
but in itself is not enough.

508
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,860
And so, again,
thinking about what

509
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,150
do you have to build to
do this hydrogen economy,

510
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,820
it comes back to what
do you have to invent.

511
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,090
And so in this case, you
want to invent a cryocooler.

512
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,420
And so zero boiloff
cryocoolers-- by the way,

513
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,730
cryocoolers are not
anything that's brand new.

514
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,090
If you ever see somebody
with heat vision goggles--

515
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,550
they have a version
of these kinds

516
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,340
of things in miniature Stirling
engines and things like that,

517
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,220
inside of them.

518
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,600
But when you want
to do this in space,

519
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,820
it's just never really
been done before.

520
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,480
And you're talking about
liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen.

521
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,350
And you need to store them at
very, very low temperatures

522
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,090
and in a vacuum.

523
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,430
This is one of those
things where I say,

524
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,900
when I got to Blue 18
months ago, I was actually--

525
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,830
I was worried about
this invention.

526
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,150
It had never been demonstrated.

527
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,970
But we hit our NASA
milestone about two months

528
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,098
ago or so, on Earth.

529
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,640
So we still haven't
done it in space.

530
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,470
But it was in vacuum on Earth.

531
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,710
We demonstrated that we
were able to, in vacuum,

532
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,535
keep at 20k and 90k.

533
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:43,910
Those are the
stable temperatures

534
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,860
that we need to
keep liquid hydrogen

535
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,360
and oxygen from boiling off.

536
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,520
And so it's a huge
milestone change.

537
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,780
Again, hard problem--
but if we can knock down

538
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,910
these hard problems,
we can actually

539
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,980
get the incredible foundation
of this hydrogen ecosystem

540
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,570
in space.

541
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,570
So we talked about reducing the
cost of space at least to orbit.

542
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,290
We've talked about building
a hydrogen economy.

543
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,530
Third, I would
postulate that the Moon

544
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,570
is our strategic gateway.

545
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,750
And this may not be the
common wisdom across all space

546
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,290
companies, but it is ours.

547
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:25,020
And I don't know where you all
fall down on the Fermi paradox.

548
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,250
But if you're in
the simulation camp,

549
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,930
the Moon would be a cheat code.

550
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,330
I mean, who would possibly
put this body three days away

551
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:41,000
from Earth, no atmosphere, with
asteroids and meteorites hitting

552
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,730
it for millions of
years, guaranteed

553
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,527
to have every element
known to personkind on it.

554
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:51,110
You would never have
guessed something

555
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,735
like this could
possibly have happened.

556
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:53,777
But, indeed, it is there.

557
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,443
And I don't think
we're in a simulation.

558
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:56,700
So we're going to use it.

559
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,070
[LAUGHTER]

560
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:04,710
And it's our mine, our resource
depot, three days away.

561
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,190
And it's incredibly
rich in resources.

562
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,440
And it's something
that we really want.

563
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,160
We want to do.

564
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,150
So a lot of what we're
doing is thinking

565
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,830
about going back to the Moon.

566
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,070
But it's not just about
going back to the Moon.

567
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,160
In fact, our lunar team
is not called Lunar.

568
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,960
It's called Lunar Permanence.

569
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,160
We've been to the Moon.

570
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,300
We've been there and back
a few times, a dozen times.

571
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,660
But we didn't stick.

572
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,400
And that was an
amazing accomplishment,

573
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,900
by the way-- probably
fast-forwarded

574
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,400
the Moon 20 years, the
Apollo program, if not more.

575
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,130
But now you want to
go there to stay.

576
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,690
And you want to go
there and be able to use

577
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,600
the resources that are up there
in clever and innovative ways.

578
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,010
So how are we doing that?

579
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,020
Well, we're going to
do it in two steps.

580
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,800
This is the original
Apollo lunar

581
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,490
module, the LEM on top of it.

582
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,850
Our first vehicle, that you see
here, is our Mark 1 vehicle.

583
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,670
It is in final
assembly right now.

584
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,450
It's just about to go off to
vacuum test in a little bit.

585
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,520
And it is a cargo lander.

586
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,940
And we'll go to the Moon, first
quarter of next year probably,

587
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,150
in that range.

588
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,710
And it will be the
biggest vehicle

589
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,467
to have ever landed on the Moon.

590
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:21,800
We're not going to make it easy.

591
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,120
We're going to do a
triple Lindy here.

592
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,537
We're going to land it on near
the south pole of the Moon.

593
00:27:25,537 --> 00:27:28,450
So it's a big
effort for the team.

594
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,520
But just to put
that in comparison,

595
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,880
then contrast it to
what we call Mark 2--

596
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,230
by the way, Mark 1--

597
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,810
we just won a NASA contract
to take Viper to the Moon.

598
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,690
So it'll be serial
number 2 of Mark 1

599
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,260
will take Viper to the Moon.

600
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,910
And then next to it is the
human-rated Mark 2 vehicle.

601
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,800
We're also doing a
cargo version of that.

602
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,720
But to give you a sense
of the scale of that,

603
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,490
it's 15 meters tall--

604
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,340
30 metric tons to
the lunar surface.

605
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,750
So this is the
semi-truck that is

606
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,480
going to be able to
pull lots of cargo

607
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,690
down to the Moon to allow
us to get that permanence

608
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,600
and begin to plant the
seeds for a permanent base

609
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,600
there, that we can then-- again,
manufacturing, mine the Moon,

610
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,270
and begin to build the
infrastructure there to hop

611
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,540
off to the rest.

612
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,190
And so you can see an incredible
amount of difference in mass

613
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,740
from where the Apollo
missions were up until--

614
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,790
that might be a typo.

615
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,970
I think it's 30 metric
tons, but I could be wrong.

616
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:29,350
So what do we have to
do to make the Moon more

617
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,120
interesting in terms
of infrastructure--

618
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,950
back to the same things.

619
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,320
Actually, this is going to
seem very duplicative to some

620
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,820
of the students
that presented to me

621
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,910
earlier on your
own class project,

622
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,650
or I guess NASA project,
for being able to navigate

623
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,340
autonomously on the Moon.

624
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,100
We're going to have
to build vehicles

625
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,580
that can traverse the Moon.

626
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,460
Some are going to
do mining, some

627
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,150
are going to be
to do exploration,

628
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,500
some are going to be transport.

629
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,440
And the first stages
of this are how

630
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,450
do we build a rover that
can be able to do this?

631
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,990
And I know you guys--
the Maple team, which

632
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,850
I saw present earlier
today, it was just

633
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,320
great to see the
progress you made.

634
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,980
Second place is a huge
achievement in this.

635
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,930
And I was sitting
there biting my tongue

636
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,270
because I know how hard the
problem is, because I meet

637
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,890
with this team every
two weeks and I

638
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,430
get a sense of what's going on.

639
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:25,350
So our effort here is to start
taking payloads up to the Moon.

640
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,190
Our first one will be on
Firefly's next lander.

641
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,900
Our honeybee team
is doing the rover.

642
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,050
And it will be a
traditional rover

643
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,590
in every sense of the word.

644
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,400
It's lower cost.

645
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,080
But it will be teleoperated
and be able to be teleoperated.

646
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,300
But we're, in
parallel with that,

647
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,870
going to put a complete
autonomous package on it,

648
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,960
so that we, in parallel, can
run experiments about what does

649
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,620
autonomy look like on the Moon?

650
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,920
So that vehicles after
that and after that

651
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,380
will get steadily more
advanced as we move through.

652
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,460
And I think, again, it was
one of those things that

653
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,540
was shown in very, very
good detail earlier today.

654
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,650
But having worked on
autonomous vehicles

655
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,190
for a lot of the last
10 years of my life--

656
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,700
Zoox was in my team at Amazon--

657
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,780
much of the problem of
getting autonomy working

658
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,662
is a data problem.

659
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:22,190
That's why when you go
around San Francisco,

660
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,500
you see lots of Waymo
cars with a driver in it,

661
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,210
with sensors on it or Zoox cars.

662
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,420
They are training
up the road systems

663
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,190
and getting data
and understanding

664
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,900
what are the anomalous things
that happen in traffic.

665
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,670
Last time I checked, we
don't have those on the Moon.

666
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,880
And, in fact, you could say,
oh, but wasn't Apollo up there

667
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,580
with a rover?

668
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,960
Yes-- but the
cameras, not so good.

669
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,050
They were running.

670
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,410
I think there's seven
hours of true video.

671
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,910
But when you back
it off, it ends up

672
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,070
being about an hour
because it was running

673
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,810
at 12 frames per second.

674
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,040
It only took a snapshot
every so often.

675
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,810
And so we do have that data.

676
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,250
But it is not
representative of what

677
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,900
you're going to see, especially
at different parts of the Moon.

678
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,440
As you get to the poles,
obviously, the lighting

679
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
conditions change dramatically.

680
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,728
And you can be in night
for a long period of time.

681
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:12,770
You can be in sunlight
for a long period of time.

682
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,700
And so the navigation challenge
becomes incredibly complicated.

683
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,220
And so what we're able to
do through simulation--

684
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,740
this is actually a game engine
running our lunar terrain

685
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,340
scenarios internally.

686
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,360
And we can then do a digital
twin of what a rover looks like.

687
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,330
And we can try different
sensor packages

688
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,550
and say, huh, I wonder if it'd
be better with stereo optics

689
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,780
or it'd be better with LiDAR?

690
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,350
Would it be better if we
had a really good IMU?

691
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,460
Or should we figure out
a way that the lander has

692
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,170
really, really
interesting beacons

693
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,600
and use trigonometry to
figure the problem out.

694
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,740
There's lots of different
ways you can solve this.

695
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,920
But it turns out to be a
pretty tractable problem.

696
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,770
And we are very
excited about where

697
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,010
we're going to get to here.

698
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,780
The other thing about the Moon--

699
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,070
I talked about how
resource-rich it is--

700
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,540
is that you don't
have to go very far.

701
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,360
I was implying
that you could dig

702
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,370
and you'd find platinum
here and gold there

703
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,930
and unobtainium there.

704
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,840
That's true.

705
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,490
I'm very big an
optimist on that.

706
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,530
But the regolith itself is
incredibly rich in resources.

707
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,040
So we have a whole different
team called Blue Alchemist.

708
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,460
Again, infrastructure--
figuring out

709
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,300
how to build reactors that
can be powered on the Moon,

710
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,500
but that you can just put in one
side of this robotic reactor,

711
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,270
throw the regolith in it, and
literally out the other end

712
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,830
is going to come a
silicon solar panel.

713
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,250
And this has been proven in our
labs already in the piece parts.

714
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,040
And we're now in the
formulation stage

715
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,090
of putting that all together.

716
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:49,170
And in our labs, in California,
we're getting purities

717
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,970
of silicon at more than,
I guess, three or four--

718
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,210
five 9s at this point, 99.999%.

719
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,980
So this is incredibly optimistic
to be able to now create

720
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,100
power on the Moon.

721
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,270
And once we crack
silica and that,

722
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,150
the refining process
actually works across a lot

723
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,390
of different types of things.

724
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,650
So the more we find out
about regolith and what's

725
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,390
there and one layer below,
the more this on premise, on

726
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:20,180
lunar ability to be able
to get rich resources

727
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,450
is really going to
be game changing

728
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,990
in a sense of infrastructure.

729
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,480
Again, it's just
less payload you

730
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,230
have to bring from other Earth.

731
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,475
The final thing I want
to talk about in terms

732
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,850
of infrastructure-- we've
talked about lowering the cost,

733
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,770
hydrogen economy, use this cheat
code of the moon as a stepping

734
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,490
stone--

735
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,560
is building comms
infrastructure.

736
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,340
If there's anything
we've learned on Earth,

737
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,150
is that comms communications
infrastructure

738
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,990
is incredibly important.

739
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:56,823
The amount of just exponential
growth in both free speech

740
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,740
and the ability to
understand what's going on,

741
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,790
because we have open comms
systems and effectively

742
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,190
unlimited bandwidth in
lots of parts of the Earth,

743
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,010
has changed how we think
about our social life.

744
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,510
It certainly thinks about how
we change about our work life.

745
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,949
It changes productivity.

746
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,219
There's no reason to believe
that that's not going

747
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,760
to be true in space as well.

748
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,065
And if you look at the
infrastructure in space today--

749
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:19,690
again, not taking anything away
from the amazing engineers that

750
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,830
put the infrastructure
that's there--

751
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,389
it's aging.

752
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:29,960
The infrastructure around Mars
should have died many years ago.

753
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,679
What's around cislunar is aging.

754
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,400
Even in the upper parts of Earth
orbit is aging in many ways.

755
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,120
And so we believe that
you have to think about

756
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,900
how do we build the
internet of space,

757
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,520
how do we lay that
infrastructure?

758
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,090
So again, that entrepreneur,
that's coming in the future,

759
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,850
just knows comms is
free or so inexpensive.

760
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,880
It rounds to free.

761
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,520
And so one of the things
that we're thinking about

762
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,830
to start this is building--

763
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,890
we have a satellite
platform that

764
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,870
can be used for lots of
different esoteric orbits.

765
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,760
It can be in GEO.

766
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,710
This example I'm
showing you here

767
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,740
is for the Mars
Communication Orbiter or MCO.

768
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,810
So we would take a-- this is
a 20 kilowatt satellite bus.

769
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,240
It has an incredible delta-v--

770
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,310
4,000 meters of delta-v through
both chemical and electrical

771
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,430
propulsion.

772
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,350
And we would send this to Mars.

773
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,800
It would sit in Mars orbit.

774
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,997
Then you can see it shed off a
bunch of little baby satellites,

775
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:31,330
because it has a lot of payload.

776
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,630
That would circle Mars.

777
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,020
Think of them as the Kuiper
constellation around Mars.

778
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,840
And they would then
call back to this hub,

779
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,850
which is highly powered.

780
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,370
And it would use laser
communications and RF

781
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,890
communications to get back
to something in LEO orbit

782
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,330
on Earth or a ground station,
depending on what we do.

783
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,460
And then you can
then stamp these out.

784
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,110
You can do a few
around cislunar.

785
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,420
You can do one out in GEO.

786
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,330
You can communicate down
to these proliferated LEO

787
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,530
constellations, like
Starlink or Kuiper.

788
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,460
And you begin to start
seeing an architecture where

789
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,050
you, as an entrepreneur, have
this amazing comms capability,

790
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,005
just like you have if you plug
in to your Wi-Fi that's kind

791
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:11,130
of right around the corner.

792
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,370

793
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,610
This is a sense of the
kind of data bandwidth

794
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,880
that we'll be able to change.

795
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,225
And i it's an order of
magnitude at least--

796
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:23,100
I think we'll actually
do a little bit better

797
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,050
than this-- as when you can
start thinking about this.

798
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,740
And the first
advantages here is not

799
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,240
going to be that
young entrepreneur.

800
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,780
Like I said, that's multiple
build generations away.

801
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,150
But it's going to be science.

802
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,080
And we're going to
learn more about Mars.

803
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,530
So much is throttled today
about what we can put down

804
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,150
on the surface of
Mars for payloads

805
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,480
or on the surface of the Moon.

806
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,960
And more bandwidth we have, the
more science that can be done,

807
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,050
the more we'll understand
about these bodies

808
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,540
as we look through this.

809
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,150
So I'll just finish
just summarizing

810
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,646
a few of these things.

811
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:56,640
That if you're going
to go and build

812
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,775
a place where millions of people
can live and work in space,

813
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:01,728
you have to start somewhere.

814
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:04,020
Somebody asked me this question
earlier today at lunch.

815
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,980
They said, well,
where do you start?

816
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,970
And I would postulate, what
we talked about here today is

817
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,790
where you start.

818
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,910
Start with the LEGO building
blocks that are infrastructure.

819
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,430
And if you start there
and you do it well and get

820
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,940
other companies to do
it well, then generation

821
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,440
after this or the generation
after that will help a lot.

822
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,000
My team would kill me
if I just stopped there.

823
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,470
So I'm going to give a
unbelievable pitch for MIT.

824
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,340
Despite not going
to this university,

825
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,770
I'm still going to give a pitch.

826
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,160
We have incredible people.

827
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,388
I know a number of you
have done internships.

828
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:39,180
Thank you for that.

829
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,555
If you haven't
done an internship

830
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:42,930
and you want to do an
internship, please,

831
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,100
that would be great, too.

832
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,290
But some of the faces
that you see here--

833
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,330
Jordan is the
first one up there.

834
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,720
He runs all of New Glenn
and he is an MIT graduate.

835
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,830
Henry, who runs the entire
second stage and reusable

836
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,780
and fairing program,
MIT graduate.

837
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,580
And his son just was one of
the 10 most recent invitees

838
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,120
to be astronauts for NASA.

839
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,700
So that's kind of cool, too.

840
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,230
And I would just
say that I'm biased.

841
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,380
I'll be the first
person to say that.

842
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,970
But I love this company.

843
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,901
It is so missionary.

844
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,537
I told Jeff I would do
this for free for him.

845
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:19,120
Luckily, he didn't
take me up on that.

846
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,850
[LAUGHTER]

847
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,180
But every little bit
of it, I go to work

848
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,870
with a smile on because I
really do think WHAT we're doing

849
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,850
is helpful for the planet
and it's very cool.

850
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,350
And so often, having worked
in and around technology

851
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,790
for 30 years, you don't
often find the Venn diagrams

852
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,560
that intersect there, where
it's awesome, cool technology.

853
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,140
And you just have
a ball doing it.

854
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,480
Sometimes it's laborious
or sometimes you

855
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,200
trade those various
different things.

856
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,390
So I want to thank you for that.

857
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,900
And before I go
to Q&A, I did want

858
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,138
to ask Professor Shah
to come up as well.

859
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:57,650
We've been thinking about
this relationship from MIT

860
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,260
for a long time, so
much so that every

861
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,860
once in a while on New Shepard,
we fly a pennant to space.

862
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,810
And this one went up
on our first flight.

863
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,820
And so there's not
many from that flight.

864
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,470
But we wanted to present
it to MIT as a thank you

865
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,350
for the partnership.

866
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,270
OK.

867
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,205
Yeah, thank you.

868
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:15,830
That's awesome.

869
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,640
Thank you so much.

870
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,000
I appreciate that.

871
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,840
