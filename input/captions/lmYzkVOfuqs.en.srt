1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,400
okay here we are good

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,000
afternoon so we have done chemical uh

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,320
kinetics and

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,599
U today again with with chemical kinetic

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,800
we are going

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,800
to uh approach

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
uh

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:48,559
the truly non equilibrium thermodynamics

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,120
topics including on Sager relations that

10
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,960
will we will introduce uh

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,920
today from the chemical kinetics point

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:03,480
of view so let

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,480
me remind you of where we

14
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,200
were and also it will allow us to

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,240
introduce uh some new

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,240
ideas on things that we already

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,920
know so consider a a a single chemical

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
reaction

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,680
mechanism which we have learned

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,920
to represent by this equation here

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,040
stochiometric coefficients and symbols

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,920
so the chemical compounds

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,920
and this is the way we have

24
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,680
written the reaction

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,640
rates or more precisely the rates of

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,640
change of the reaction

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,920
coordinates and just as a

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,200
reminder these are the concentrations

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,840
stochiometric coefficients of the

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,280
forward and backward half

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,439
reactions these are the reaction

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,280
constants and the reactant for the

33
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,320
reaction constants we

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,520
have uh

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,760
developed two equivalent ways of writing

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,760
them one in terms of the arous

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
activation

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,599
energy and the other in terms of these

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,480
um equilibrium constants of the uh

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,840
forward than backward

41
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,840
reactions half

42
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,200
reactions

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,480
okay and of course the the net reaction

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,720
rate is the difference between the

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,599
forward and the backward we

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
Define uh this ratio and the logarithm

47
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,400
of this ratio we call the degree of this

48
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,760
equilibrium and we have seen examples in

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,400
which this degree of dis equilibrium

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:04,760
builds up as the uh chemical

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,040
uh Dynamics doesn't isn't fast enough to

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,959
catch up and maintain equilibrium for

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,080
example in the nozal expansions that we

54
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,080
have

55
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,760
seen now we can write this difference uh

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,599
also by using this

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,760
ratio in this

58
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,640
way we

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,519
Factor Epsilon plus out and inside

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,080
remains Epsilon minus over Epsilon plus

61
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,760
which is e to Theus the

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,040
Affinity or we can Factor also Epsilon

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,080
Min do minus and then this is the

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,879
equivalent

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,080
expression

66
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,720
clearly this shows that the reaction

67
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,040
rates are

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,040
functions of the

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,280
um um

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,879
the affinities of of of each reaction is

71
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,040
is a function of its own Affinity

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,200
through this

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,519
exponential but it is also a

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,759
function of a bunch of other stuff which

75
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,880
is included in here and in these

76
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,560
concentrations so it is it is not

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,840
correct to say that the uh reaction

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,080
rates are functions of the Affinity

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,360
period they're also function of the

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,000
affinities this is important

81
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,759
because in a moment we will see that you

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,199
may want to uh construct

83
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,199
other relations between rates and

84
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,080
affinities you can also do uh the

85
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,600
following you can uh

86
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,400
divide the rate reaction rate by the

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Affinity of that

88
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,639
reaction and

89
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:10,039
therefore it would uh this would look

90
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,800
like uh and if I write

91
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:18,199
Epsilon dot J equals

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,039
L JJ y

93
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,600
j it

94
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:29,000
looks like uh a linear relation that it

95
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,440
is not linear because the LJ JS depend

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,120
on the affinity

97
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,120
and depend on bunch of other

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,560
stuff nevertheless

99
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:46,000
this uh ratio this

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,800
L proportionality constant

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,520
between which constant is not between

102
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,600
rate and Affinity can also be viewed as

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,600
if you do the substitutions as except

104
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,400
for the gas constant the denominator is

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,479
this is the logarithmic

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,840
mean of the forward and the backward

107
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,000
reactions

108
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,599
okay now we are interested in seeing

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,280
what happens if we are near equilibrium

110
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,240
you know that at equilibrium the

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,639
Affinity is equal to zero so if we

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
approach

113
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,639
equilibrium uh so the

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Affinity uh is small positive or

115
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,319
negative but

116
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,680
small then

117
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,240
we can linearize these Expressions here

118
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:41,400
e to the e to the minus

119
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:49,080
X the first linear approximation is 1 -

120
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:54,599
x or e to the x is uh 1+ X in either

121
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,599
case this linearizes becomes just the

122
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,800
affinity and so we get an expression

123
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,160
like this

124
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,039
one but

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:13,080
with the coefficient now being the value

126
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,400
at y equal Zer in the taor series

127
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,960
expansion you have to take the constant

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,800
terms and evaluate

129
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,440
it evaluate them where do you do the

130
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,120
expansion about in this in this case

131
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,199
it's when the Affinity is equal to zero

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,440
and when the Affinity is equal to zero

133
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,960
the Epsilon plus and minus 10 to the

134
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,199
same value which is epsilon0 the

135
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,160
equilibrium

136
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,319
value which is also so since they are

137
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,360
equal also their mean even even the

138
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,360
logarithmic mean are is

139
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,400
equal and you can Al also Express that

140
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,520
if you use

141
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,479
this definition down here and what we

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:00,240
have done in the previous lecture uh

143
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:03,560
lectures you can also connect it to the

144
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,120
um concentration at equilibrium of the

145
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,120
activated con uh

146
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,159
complex

147
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:16,039
Okay so we've

148
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:18,400
linearized now we have a linear

149
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,680
relation and if we substitute this

150
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,520
linear relation the expression for the

151
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,400
entropy rate of change of the entropy

152
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,479
which for a closed um

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,479
system is also is also the entrop

154
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,599
entropy produced by reversibility so it

155
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,080
has to be greater than

156
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,080
zero you see

157
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:47,800
that uh it becomes the

158
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:50,720
square it's a constant this L uh times

159
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,680
um the Affinity Square I mean yes the

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
Affinity

161
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:04,200
um uh squared or the inverse of L

162
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:07,320
times the rate squar this is why we can

163
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:12,680
identify the inverse of

164
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:16,360
this ratio L as a sort of a chemical

165
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,240
resistance uh to

166
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,240
um going back to

167
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:29,440
equilibrium the the

168
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,640
higher this it means the lower the L and

169
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,839
therefore for a given dise equilibrium

170
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,600
because the Affinity is dise equilibrium

171
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,160
for a given dise

172
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,160
equilibrium you have uh lesser rate

173
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,160
towards

174
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,320
equilibrium

175
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,640
okay now in practice we have

176
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,360
seen like in this example that we've

177
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
discussed few

178
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,200
times

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,560
hydrogen the detailed kinetic mechanism

180
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,399
contains a lot of chemical

181
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,519
reactions and you need them in order to

182
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,279
describe the the

183
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,760
Dynamics however you may notice that uh

184
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:19,279
these reactions are not all independent

185
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,279
of one another just for an

186
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:30,320
example uh here if you take uh the 11

187
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,440
and the 14 reaction and subtract them

188
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,040
it gives you the same result as if you

189
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,519
take the first and the third reaction

190
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,880
and you subtract

191
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,320
them so they are lineally combined

192
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,320
they're not

193
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,279
independent and there may be uh there

194
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,399
are many

195
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:55,079
other U linear dependencies

196
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,760
here so let's go back so up to here is

197
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:03,680
the same slide that we were on uh a

198
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:07,680
minute ago this is the new part so in

199
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,720
the idea is that now we have a complex

200
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,040
chemical uh detailed

201
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,600
scheme or a reaction

202
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,600
Network and

203
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,240
uh it contains a lot of linearly

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,680
dependent

205
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,880
reactions that means that we can

206
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,600
identify a subset

207
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:38,160
of linearly independent

208
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,160
ones with respect to which you

209
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,920
can um write all the

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,600
others so let's suppose that the

211
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,880
stochiometric

212
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,120
coefficients now here I'm running out of

213
00:11:50,880 --> 00:12:00,360
symbol so instead of new I'm using this

214
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,720
other uh letter that I wish uh your

215
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,600
Greek colleague was here today because I

216
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,760
forget what the name

217
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,880
is in any case it's

218
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,240
a this is the doomric coefficients of

219
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,560
the linearly independent mechanism with

220
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:20,000
respect to which I can write all the

221
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,800
other ones so all the other uh schemes

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,880
for example in the 24 for hydrogen are

223
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,279
linear combinations so these X are the

224
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,440
linear combination coefficients of the

225
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,519
independent ones

226
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,399
and due to the uh

227
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,399
linearity of the

228
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,399
way

229
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,480
uh uh

230
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,240
the the affinities

231
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,800
are

232
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,240
defined also the Affinity of the J

233
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,120
reaction is the same combination of with

234
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,279
the same linear coefficients of the

235
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,399
affinities of the independent

236
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:00,519
ones and so when you substitute this

237
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:03,240
into the expression for

238
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,760
the rate of entropy

239
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,519
change which for many reactions is the

240
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,240
sum of the products of of the rate times

241
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,639
the affinity for each

242
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,279
reaction that substitution plus plus a a

243
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,279
change

244
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,760
of switch of summation symbols and

245
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,320
uh and recognizing that this

246
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,560
one I'm sorry that this uh that this

247
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,199
linear combination of the rates is also

248
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,600
uh the rate of the independent reaction

249
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,600
turns out that this summation which

250
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,800
before had the 24 terms now as the

251
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,880
minimum number of terms which is the

252
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,199
number of independent reactions their

253
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,680
rates and their affinities it's the same

254
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,680
product of rate and an affinity

255
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,199
that's what we just

256
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,720
got and above is just a reminder what

257
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,600
was the

258
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,399
essential of in the previous slide so if

259
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,839
we keep

260
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:29,839
U uh going and

261
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,839
substitute um

262
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:39,759
uh again the the expression for

263
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,040
the for

264
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:47,759
the affinities of the J reaction in

265
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,480
terms of the of these

266
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,839
other

267
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,279
Upsilon Affinity of the independent ons

268
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,279
you come up with

269
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,920
this and

270
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:08,759
therefore you have a a a

271
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:13,240
quadratic form in

272
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:16,920
the uh coefficients of the linear

273
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,880
combination that couple and

274
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,720
combine uh the L's so the ratio rate to

275
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,639
Affinity of the single non indpendent

276
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,519
reactions okay so this linear

277
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,519
combination if you notice

278
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,839
uh not linear this is a quadratic

279
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:39,000
combination of the L's if you notice uh

280
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,519
is symmetric because if you change K and

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,040
L it doesn't it doesn't

282
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,680
change all

283
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,160
right so we come up with the fact that

284
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,560
the entropy production is a quadratic

285
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,800
form in the affinities of the

286
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,759
independent uh

287
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:04,040
reactions and the Matrix of the U

288
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,360
quadratic form is non- negative that's

289
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,480
required by the fact that you need that

290
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,480
to be non negative to satisfy the

291
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,199
principle of entropy non

292
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,199
decrease and it is also

293
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,519
symmetric if you take this Matrix and

294
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,519
take the its

295
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,880
inverse you

296
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:35,319
can uh re

297
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,600
right uh this double summation in

298
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:41,319
instead of in Terms of the quadratic

299
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,319
form in the affinities it's a quadratic

300
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:46,440
form in the rates of the independent

301
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:50,839
reactions where the coefficients are

302
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:55,040
these and these RS are some sort of

303
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,040
generalized uh resistance

304
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,399
now these independent mechanisms are

305
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,520
coupled via these um linear

306
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:19,679
combinations so if you try to write the

307
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:24,640
rate of uh each one it is uh not any

308
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:30,840
longer just uh dependent on its

309
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,840
Affinity it depends also on the others

310
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,919
and this

311
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,799
coupling

312
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,880
uh is important and is typical of uh of

313
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,880
non equilibrium

314
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,760
behavior and we will see more about this

315
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,919
because that's a a good introduction to

316
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,080
what happens in in many other phenomena

317
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,400
for non

318
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,240
equilibrium of course I mean so far we

319
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,799
didn't believe linearize yet but of

320
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,559
course we can linearize again we can

321
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,000
assume that we go near equilibrium where

322
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,679
all the affinities are go to

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,039
zero so that's the linearization that we

324
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,000
did

325
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:18,960
before and this is the linear

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
combination of the rates so the rate of

327
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,720
the independent reactions becomes

328
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,960
summation like this and if you keep

329
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,960
going in the end you find that it is a

330
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,520
um a

331
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,640
summation of

332
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:44,240
the those affinities times these um sort

333
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,480
of generalized inverse resistance so

334
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,120
let's call it the generalized

335
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,760
conductivity

336
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,039
Matrix

337
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,039
symmetric and

338
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,200
again the rate of entropy production is

339
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,159
a quadratic form either in the

340
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,360
affinities or in the Rays this time it

341
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:09,799
is a real quadratic form up

342
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:14,280
here I sort of were a bit sloppy in

343
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:18,679
saying it's quadratic form but

344
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,520
um these coefficients uh may also depend

345
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,760
on the affinities when you're far from

346
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,000
equilibrium so it's not really a

347
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,240
quadratic dependence when you're off

348
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,320
equilibrium whereas when you linearize

349
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,320
then it becomes a a a quadratic

350
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,880
form and these properties here since

351
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,840
they are evaluated at

352
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,320
equilibrium they are equilibrium

353
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,400
properties so if you want to measure

354
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:55,480
them for example in a molecular Dynamic

355
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,730
simulation you would have to wait uh uh

356
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,840
you you have to to to go and wait for

357
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,600
[Music]

358
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,799
uh identify an equilibrium state in

359
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,200
order to evaluate

360
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,840
this which makes it easy because

361
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,600
equilibrium is is is reached quickly

362
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,120
because of

363
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,039
collisions and uh uh and so these

364
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,520
are easily

365
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:26,679
measurable Properties

366
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:30,440
or since we know if we have the full

367
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,679
reaction mechanism like the 25 24

368
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,120
reactions for hydrogen then you you can

369
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:40,120
infer these values from those uh

370
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,120
rates

371
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:55,559
okay so now let's step back one moment

372
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,559
and assume we don't

373
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,559
have uh developed

374
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,320
a a

375
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,280
theory

376
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,919
for uh reaction

377
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,799
rates and all we know is from the

378
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,159
entropy

379
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,600
balance this expression which is one of

380
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,000
the first that we derived on indeed

381
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,600
chemical reactions because remember the

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,279
Affinity is the derivative of s with

383
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,600
respect to

384
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:27,279
Epsilon so this is simply the rate of

385
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,480
change the derivative of s with respect

386
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:33,200
to T which here

387
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,919
is taken to be the entropy produced by

388
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,960
reversibility because we are consider

389
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:41,240
considering the isolated

390
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,240
system okay so that is our

391
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,480
constraint it's part of our model with

392
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:52,039
which we like to describe properties uh

393
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,840
even far from equilibrium from chemical

394
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:58,279
equilibrium but assuming a sort of a

395
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,279
pseudo equilibrium

396
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:09,000
okay we also know that at maximum

397
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,159
entropy which is stable equilibrium

398
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
chemical equilibrium the affinities must

399
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,960
be equal to zero and now suppose that

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,440
our Theory we want to develop a theory

401
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,120
in which the rates are functions of the

402
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,120
affinities and nothing

403
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,760
else or maybe some other parameters that

404
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,919
can be kept constant while you change

405
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,919
the

406
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,760
affinities clearly when you are at

407
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,760
equilibrium the net rate must be zero so

408
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
you want this function to be zero when

409
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,360
the argument is

410
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,679
zero and this this argument is a is a is

411
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,159
a vector so that's why it's bold phase

412
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,159
so this zero this is a list of

413
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,159
conditions

414
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,919
so that you can substitute that into the

415
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,919
expression for the entropy and you get

416
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,679
that the

417
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,799
entropy uh rate of change is also a

418
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,039
function of the

419
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:16,640
Affinity

420
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:20,320
now you linearize linearize around

421
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,320
equilibrium this

422
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,159
postulated

423
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,440
constitutive equation which presumably

424
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,440
should represent uh our rat

425
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,840
so we

426
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,760
do the

427
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,120
linear uh tailor

428
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,360
series and we will stop at the first

429
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,360
term that is non

430
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,559
zero okay so the first term is zero this

431
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,080
should be a bold phase zero okay then we

432
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:58,120
have plus the first derivative evaluated

433
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,320
at zero this is also another bold uh and

434
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,400
that

435
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:06,600
multiplied by y so this is the linear

436
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:11,640
term plus dot dot dot dot because in

437
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:15,039
fact this is already um different from

438
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,440
zero I'm going to call

439
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:22,159
this partial

440
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,320
derivative H is L our generalized

441
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:29,200
conductivity the inverse of the

442
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,279
resistance matrix it's a matrix

443
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,360
and it's a matrix that we can also write

444
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
as the

445
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,960
Jacobian

446
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,520
matrix uh of the various uh rates as

447
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,240
functions of the

448
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,000
various

449
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,799
affinities big Matrix to be evaluated at

450
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,799
Y is equal to

451
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,799
Zer then you take these expression

452
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:59,000
substitute it into the expression for

453
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,960
the entropy production and get

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,919
that the entropy production is a

455
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,799
quadratic form in the affinities with

456
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,600
the metrix of the generalized

457
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,919
conductivity set to serve as

458
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,200
coefficients of that

459
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,120
form that

460
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,480
requires that being this the dominating

461
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,200
term in the our expansion these Matrix

462
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,039
must be non- negative in order to

463
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,600
satisfy the principle of entropy non

464
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,600
decre non

465
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:32,760
decrease you may also do uh the linear

466
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:38,120
expansion of this expression here for

467
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:40,919
the entropy with respect to again to Y

468
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,799
around

469
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:49,399
equilibrium if if you do

470
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,320
that you get the the term at equilibrium

471
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:53,360
is zero because the affinities are zero

472
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,640
you put zero here you get

473
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,279
zero the first derivative of s uh dot

474
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:04,320
with respect to

475
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:07,080
Y uh at equilibrium is also

476
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,240
zero when you evaluate it you here is

477
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,240
the

478
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:16,120
evaluation so you you have to take

479
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,399
derivative properly of this expression

480
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,120
here with respect to the Y's and it's

481
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:25,679
better to do them with the indexes

482
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,679
otherwise you sort of Miss uh some

483
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,600
details so it

484
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:38,039
the S with respect to y

485
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,279
j it picks up from this summation the

486
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,840
Epsilon J

487
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:47,600
plus the summation of the Yi times the

488
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,200
derivative of Epsilon I with respect to

489
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,760
YJ

490
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,919
and at equilibrium the epsilons are zero

491
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,960
the Y are zero so this is zero that is

492
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,640
why this first term that the linear term

493
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,520
in the entropy

494
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,080
disappears showing that indeed indeed uh

495
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,440
we are at at a

496
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,440
maximum or a

497
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,760
minimum the derivative is

498
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,679
zero and then we go to the second uh

499
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,679
term in the tailor

500
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:26,000
expansion so this is the general one but

501
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,080
then you remember that the coefficient

502
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,960
has to be evaluated at zero

503
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:38,679
so you have to evaluate this hestian of

504
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,679
this Matrix of the second order

505
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,039
coefficients second order

506
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,399
derivatives

507
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:50,640
uh and so you take uh it's the

508
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,840
derivative with respect to YK of this

509
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,720
first derivative so you get derivative

510
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:00,120
of Epsilon J with respect to

511
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:04,799
YK then from the summation

512
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:08,080
uh corresponding to the YK you pick up

513
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:12,080
the cor coefficient that multiplies y k

514
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:16,360
is partial of Epsilon K respect to

515
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,720
YJ and then the summation also has some

516
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,960
leftovers which are the second

517
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,159
derivatives of the

518
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,399
epsilons however when you evaluate them

519
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,919
at equilibrium these are zero so the

520
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:30,120
summation disappears but these ones do

521
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,120
not

522
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,760
and

523
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,080
notice that the these is not equal to

524
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,760
that because one is derivative of J

525
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,000
respect to K the other is derivative of

526
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,320
K with respect to

527
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,360
J so essentially you

528
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,440
left

529
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:54,320
with these Matrix here plus it's

530
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:58,440
transpose when you switch the uh i j

531
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,440
with K you get the transpose

532
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,720
so

533
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,080
clearly the sum of the Matrix plus it's

534
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,559
transposed is a symmetric

535
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,919
Matrix which satisfies the fact that we

536
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,480
know like Schwarz theorem of second

537
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:20,760
derivatives that they're symmetric it

538
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,399
doesn't depend on the order so that that

539
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:28,399
is

540
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,399
okay so we get the same expression here

541
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,960
however in addition

542
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,000
to uh non-

543
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,600
negativity there is an additional

544
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,320
constraint that U was U proved and we

545
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:47,080
will try to see how we get there U as we

546
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:51,919
go on was proved by on Sager in 1931 for

547
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:56,320
which he got Nobel Prize in 68 and uh

548
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:59,159
which he used the statistical uh U

549
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,840
considerations to show that this

550
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,840
Matrix needs to be

551
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,320
symmetric and this

552
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:14,279
symmetry is not a trivial result it's

553
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:18,480
actually the basis for a number of

554
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:20,640
rationalizations of uh coupled non

555
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,360
equilibrium

556
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,279
phenomena that are used in variety of

557
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,600
applications of which we will touch a

558
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,519
few

559
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,760
as we go on and until the end of of the

560
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,960
course few lectures that we are left are

561
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,120
going to be all

562
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:45,600
around uh seeing the consequences of

563
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,080
this important uh result in addition to

564
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,360
seeing how you could

565
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,360
uh prove

566
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:59,919
it now this is just

567
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,919
a reminder of a

568
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,399
simple mathematics of when you have a

569
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:10,960
system like for a two for a 2X two uh

570
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:14,600
Matrix

571
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,919
L what is the consequence if the Matrix

572
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,399
is symmetric and positive and positive

573
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,399
semide definite or non-

574
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:29,600
negative and also by by seeing that uh

575
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,120
seeing this um more

576
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,440
explicitly

577
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,480
uh these relations will uh we will

578
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,000
return to these relations Al not only

579
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,960
for chemistry like here but later on

580
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,320
also we will have couple defects and we

581
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,279
will typically take them two by two

582
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,480
because uh it's already complicated with

583
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:54,559
two and uh going with more um you have

584
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,519
to first have understood the two and

585
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,519
then go to more complicated

586
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:08,919
so that's the linear

587
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,320
relation so it says that the Affinity

588
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:17,279
that the the rate of reaction

589
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:19,519
One H is proportional to the uh as a is

590
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,480
partly due to the to the fact that

591
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,600
reaction one is in dise equilibrium

592
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,240
absolute

593
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,440
one but also it's coupled with the

594
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,760
disequilibrium of reaction

595
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,799
to so in some extreme cases you might

596
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:41,200
have

597
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:44,440
a a reaction one that

598
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,039
advances not due to its own degree of

599
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,360
dise equilibrium but due to the degree

600
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,360
of dise equilibrium of another

601
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,559
reaction and you may rewrite this system

602
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,360
of equations in various ways you can

603
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,679
solve solve it so you can write the

604
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,679
affinities as functions of the rates or

605
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,679
you can do something in between in which

606
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:11,360
say the the rate of

607
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:16,639
one is U given by its own coefficient

608
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:19,679
times its own Affinity Plus something

609
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:23,240
that relates it to the rate of the other

610
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:27,000
equation the other

611
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,519
reaction okay now when a a matrix is

612
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,519
positive semide

613
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,480
definite it

614
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,480
means

615
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:42,639
that the elements of on the diagonal are

616
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,120
are non negative it means that the igen

617
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:47,600
values are non-

618
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,600
negative therefore also the product of

619
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,559
the igen values which is the determinant

620
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,360
is not

621
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,200
negative the

622
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:59,639
sum which is the trace of the Matrix is

623
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,639
not negative and so on

624
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,840
and the rate of entropy production is a

625
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:07,879
quadratic form of this

626
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,079
Matrix and a quadratic form is

627
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:12,079
written uh General this

628
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:19,919
way uh however if you write it in this

629
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:23,839
way you notice that this um um double

630
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,800
product in in the middle may not have a

631
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,399
a definite sign because the affinities

632
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,760
can be positive and negative so because

633
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,760
y1 is positive and Y2 is negative this

634
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,760
is negative and so you have a negative

635
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,200
term so there are ways like we did also

636
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:45,879
for the

637
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:48,200
brown theorem to write quadratic form in

638
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:51,040
canonical

639
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,679
forms either in terms of the affinities

640
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,079
or in terms of the rates so that it's

641
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,520
essentially a sum of squares

642
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,320
multiply it by positive

643
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:07,320
coefficients and so you make sure that

644
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,920
uh you I mean if you can manage to write

645
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,640
it this way you have

646
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:19,560
proved that you are in in shape in in

647
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,560
terms of non- negativity of the entropy

648
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,200
production sorry so the proof uh that

649
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,119
onager

650
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:38,560
gave is a requires some statistical

651
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:43,760
mechanics and I might be able to give

652
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:49,599
some hints about it later on but

653
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:52,760
um hopefully it will be given in some U

654
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,119
later versions of this course when

655
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,520
Professor Constantino will will join

656
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,280
in uh

657
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:04,520
but for the

658
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:08,440
moment let us uh prove it

659
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:11,680
from uh this principle of Maximum

660
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,440
entropy production rate proposed by

661
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,440
Ziggler around

662
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,440
1957

663
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:28,800
58 which is simple

664
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:30,440
enough and uh doesn't contain any uh any

665
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,880
a lot of

666
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:39,440
uh physics accept the

667
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:43,880
idea that um when a system is in

668
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,880
a non equilibrium

669
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:47,920
State we already know that it tends to

670
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,440
reach

671
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,640
equilibrium developing

672
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,200
entropy uh until it gets this entropy

673
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,280
gets to the maximum allowed by the

674
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,319
constraints for example

675
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,079
the energy if the system is

676
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:07,319
isolated

677
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,880
uh but this is not about uh the fact

678
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:14,000
that the entropy increases it's the fact

679
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:19,720
that the system when it is in non

680
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:23,800
equilibrium uh searches for the path of

681
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,400
U steepest Ascent in the entropy Allowed

682
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,359
by the

683
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,400
constraints so it's like you need to

684
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:32,040
climb a mountain and go to the maximum

685
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,240
of the

686
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,520
entropy there are many path that you can

687
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,760
choose in order to climb that

688
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,319
mountain okay uh it turns out the

689
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:47,119
systems like to go there in the most

690
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:49,520
direct way as possible of course there

691
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,960
are constraints like the internal

692
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,440
structure of your

693
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,680
system the molecules the collisions and

694
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,680
all

695
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,440
that uh

696
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:07,200
so here the idea is is the following

697
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,040
what are the constraints for a chemical

698
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,079
chemical reacting system they we take as

699
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,720
a constraint this equation which comes

700
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:20,160
from the entropy balance plus our model

701
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,160
for the

702
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,839
properties and

703
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:31,520
then we we we make an assumption

704
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,119
like we did before where okay we want a

705
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,720
theory in

706
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:40,599
which the rates are uh linearly related

707
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,599
to the

708
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,079
affinities so I want a linear

709
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,319
theory that means that the entropy

710
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,839
production is given by

711
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:57,560
this quadratic

712
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:00,480
form and when we take the derivative

713
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,119
respect to Affinity we have this

714
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,119
expression

715
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:15,119
here okay H notice l i j and

716
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:17,800
lji uh I am not I do not know uh if they

717
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:22,560
are equal or not I'm not assuming I want

718
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:25,400
to prove that if you assume that this

719
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,960
rate of entropy production is maximal

720
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:33,000
subject to that constraint

721
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,000
then we prove the

722
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Symmetry

723
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,560
okay now the method for uh maximizing is

724
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,839
simple we know it it's the lrange

725
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,200
multipliers method we have only one

726
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:55,359
constraint which is this

727
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,440
one so you Maxim you in order to take

728
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,240
the constrained maximum you take the

729
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,599
maximum the unconstrained maximum of

730
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,440
your function

731
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:08,599
minus the undetermined lrange

732
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,000
multiplier multiplied by uh the

733
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,079
constraint written in in the form

734
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,760
something is equal to zero so this is

735
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,720
equivalent to that equation set equal to

736
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,319
zero so it's the left hand side of that

737
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,560
equation okay and then all you do is to

738
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:27,880
take the derivative of this with respect

739
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,079
to the affinities and the set it equal

740
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,079
to

741
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:39,640
zero and so the affinities are in

742
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,079
here in here and in here so we get three

743
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,400
terms one is multiplied by one and one

744
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,680
by minus Lambda so one minus Lambda of

745
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,520
the derivative of s with respect to y s

746
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,520
dot with respect to Y plus this last

747
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,760
term uh which uh contributes an Epsilon

748
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,119
Dot time

749
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,920
Lambda okay so you set that equal to

750
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,680
zero you get this relation which says

751
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,200
Okay then if you want to do that

752
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,920
maximization your rates must be equal to

753
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Lambda minus one / Lambda times this

754
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,640
derivative this is called Ziggler

755
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,359
orthogonality principle and

756
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:28,720
we'll try to interpret that

757
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,440
in in a while

758
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,680
for for the moment uh this is the result

759
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,280
in terms of the lrange multiplier and

760
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,200
then as typical in the in the method you

761
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,640
substitute this back into the

762
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,920
constraint in order to find the value

763
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,240
for the LR multiplier so you take this

764
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,200
one substitute it back into the

765
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,200
constraint which is

766
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:57,400
here and do the

767
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:59,319
things carefully so when this derivative

768
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,480
is written up

769
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:06,480
here and it has the

770
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:11,920
L's plus the transpose of

771
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:16,160
L but now these are multiplied by ep y y

772
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,920
i and YJ under a double

773
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,440
summation if you

774
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,920
switch the I and JS here things don't

775
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,160
change because of the double

776
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,640
summation there therefore for

777
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,400
this is

778
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,800
twice this double summation here with of

779
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,800
just one

780
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,880
L but this double

781
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,800
summation written this way is the

782
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,800
entropy production

783
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,280
rate okay so we got entropy production

784
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,079
rate is equal Lambda minus 1 / Lambda *

785
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,880
T ice the right all right so that

786
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,839
imposes that this combination must be

787
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,480
equ Al to one and therefore Lambda you

788
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,400
get it when Lambda is equal to two so we

789
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,480
found the lrange multiplier Lambda is

790
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,599
equal to

791
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,040
two and we can substitute it substitute

792
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,359
it into result and so the result of the

793
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,400
maximization is that is this expression

794
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,960
here the

795
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,960
orthogonality um coefficient

796
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,760
is2 finally

797
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:39,240
uh we can substitute into

798
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,599
here our assumption for Epsilon dot so

799
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,119
this is for the left hand

800
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:49,440
side and this is for the right hand

801
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,440
side and you get this expression

802
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:58,040
here then you move things left and right

803
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:03,000
so to keep uh the this the summation of

804
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:07,319
the ljs together and and leave the lji

805
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,800
on the other side and here is the final

806
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:11,839
result that this summation must be equal

807
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,520
to

808
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:18,160
zero and it has to be equal to

809
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:21,160
zero wherever your

810
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:26,000
theory applies that

811
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:29,440
means uh in any of the non-e equilibrium

812
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,160
States so for our arbitrary choices of

813
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,119
the affinities and remember here the

814
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,280
affinities are many because you have

815
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,680
several

816
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,640
reactions that are coupled like uh like

817
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,839
the like we've seen in the example

818
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,319
so among the various choices you can

819
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:49,559
select one for example in which only one

820
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,440
of the

821
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:55,079
reactions is that um is off equilibrium

822
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,200
and the others are at

823
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,280
equilibrium that therefore picks up only

824
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,040
one term in this summation and imposes

825
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:07,160
that the uh

826
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:11,640
coefficients uh must be zero and so that

827
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,640
proves uh the symmetry of the

828
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,280
Matrix

829
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,079
so uh so we prove that at least you get

830
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,280
you get on

831
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:28,559
sag

832
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,920
symmetry if you accept the principle of

833
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,920
Maximum entry production

834
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,680
rate it's

835
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:45,520
uh not sure you can do it also in the

836
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:49,680
reverse in other words is is this and if

837
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:54,720
and only if theorem uh not so sure in

838
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:58,280
other words does uh on Sager

839
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,400
reciprocity reciprocity prove the

840
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:06,359
principle of Maximum ENT production rate

841
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,359
well I think it probably need a little

842
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,559
more this is

843
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:18,040
Ziggler and this is the pictorial

844
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:22,000
um representation of its of his

845
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,000
orthogonality relation

846
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,440
so suppose we have two

847
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:39,440
reactions and this

848
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,440
plot wants to uh

849
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:46,920
represent on a

850
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:49,760
plane um the uh

851
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:54,680
affinities so for example suppose you

852
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,680
are in this point here it represents a a

853
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:00,559
non equilibrium state

854
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,359
in which the Affinity of reaction one is

855
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,720
this

856
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,599
much the center is zero and that's

857
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,800
equilibrium and the Affinity of the

858
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,920
second reaction is is this

859
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,839
much

860
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:18,400
okay here the rate of entropy uh

861
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,640
production so the quadratic

862
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,960
form has a certain

863
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,359
value different than

864
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,480
zero and these Contour plots represent

865
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:30,800
all other

866
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,000
non equilibrium states that have that

867
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,160
same value of the

868
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,520
entropy As you move further from

869
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,200
equilibrium the entropy goes

870
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,599
up as you go towards equilibrium the

871
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,800
entropy goes down so you may think of

872
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:54,079
those U uh contour lines as those of an

873
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:54,079
ellipsoid that is touching zero at

874
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:03,359
equilibrium the red curves

875
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:07,599
represent uh the gradients of these

876
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,920
Contours so these are these curves are

877
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,480
everywhere

878
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:15,880
orthogonal

879
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:18,880
to uh the constant entropy Contour

880
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,880
uh

881
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,440
lines

882
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:29,559
okay all

883
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,559
right the expression for the

884
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,040
gradient is the gradient is like a

885
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,760
generalized derivative so uh the

886
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:46,319
derivative of s dot with respect to Y

887
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,319
Vector this is the

888
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:55,200
gradient and if I plot the gradient

889
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:58,720
uh it has it is a

890
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,720
vector which is

891
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,720
orthogonal I plot it here so it's

892
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,720
orthogonal to uh the curve for which it

893
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,160
is the

894
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:14,920
gradient

895
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:17,319
okay now what the Ziggler principle

896
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,200
orthogonality relation says is that I

897
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:25,079
take this Vector which is the gr take

898
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:27,760
half of it and that gives me the uh

899
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,799
right

900
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,720
the right

901
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:35,119
Vector the Epsilon dot is the right

902
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,040
Vector is just a half of the the red is

903
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,920
the half of the of the

904
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:44,119
black and this Vector

905
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:49,559
here uh let me now last step move it

906
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:53,280
back to uh the to to here to the

907
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:57,880
zero so then on the same plot I am now

908
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:01,280
reading on this axis the

909
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:04,000
one component so that is the rate of the

910
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,079
first reaction and on this other axis

911
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,799
the second component so that's the rate

912
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,799
of the second

913
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:18,880
reaction and what this shows is that uh

914
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:22,240
yeah you know if uh if you didn't if you

915
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,240
had only one reaction and one

916
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,640
Affinity uh the proportionality is

917
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,640
typically that uh

918
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:37,680
the rate and the Affinity have the same

919
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:41,240
sign so if uh uh if Y is is neg is

920
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:45,319
positive um Epsilon one is

921
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:48,040
positive and the their relation is uh

922
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:49,960
like take instead of this system here

923
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:54,079
instead of having 2 by two just one by

924
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,920
one it's simply the proportionality l11

925
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,720
is the direct proportionality and it

926
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,920
says that the rate of one is is

927
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,720
proportional to and also if you had only

928
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:09,160
two reaction two the rate of reaction

929
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:12,960
two is proportional to its degree of

930
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:16,599
dise equilibrium same sign because we

931
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,599
said that these L's are

932
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:23,040
positive but here you see the

933
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:27,599
coupling makes it

934
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:31,160
so so the cross the off diagonal ter

935
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,440
makes it so in this particular region of

936
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,440
of

937
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:42,359
states that look at reaction two it has

938
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:46,799
a positive Affinity but as a result of

939
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:49,160
the cap gets a negative reaction rate so

940
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:54,760
these off diagonal

941
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:59,760
terms may actually uh Drive the system

942
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:02,079
in uh somewhat unexpected

943
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,359
Direction something that if it were by

944
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,000
itself would

945
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:11,280
violate the uh the

946
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,960
entropy non decrease

947
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,640
principle because if I didn't

948
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:22,079
have also the other terms and only this

949
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:25,119
one uh it's so if I have only one

950
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:28,119
reaction it is impossible that the rate

951
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:32,280
be in the opposite sign of the

952
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:35,280
Affinity okay so that is

953
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,720
the at least in the business of

954
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,720
reactions chemical

955
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,799
reactions uh the importance of these

956
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,799
coupling

957
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:54,119
terms and it is

958
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:57,240
actually for things like these for many

959
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:59,640
aspects of this chemistry

960
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:03,640
of equilibrium that

961
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:07,640
uh also IIA pin

962
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:11,040
has gotten Nobel Prize forget now what

963
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,480
year um but I want to just that I

964
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:17,400
mention him I want to also mention that

965
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,520
if you're doing your PhD thesis in the

966
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,119
field of thermodynamics whatever field

967
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,440

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,559
thing doesn't bring a lot of money but

974
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:44,839
it's it gives you some Prestige and you

975
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:47,920
may look up uh the website of the of the

976
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:53,000
prize and see what the previous winners

977
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:56,799
are uh very diverse and very um high

978
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,799
level set of uh of guys who most of

979
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:03,400
which are now uh renowned

980
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:06,920
professors World worldwide because it's

981
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,920
like an international

982
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,119
PR

983
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,599
okay so let's do a little uh

984
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,240
switch first of all it sound like like

985
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,760
sounds like a switch back and then it

986
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,440
will be a switch forward so let's go

987
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,000
back to heat

988
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,040
transfer and this is a a slide that more

989
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,920
or less we have already seen maybe not

990
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,920
exactly in this

991
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,520
fashion you take a a onedimensional

992
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,520
fluid

993
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:51,960
element subject to a gradient of

994
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,000
temperature so it's it's fluid element

995
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,599
on one side as one temperature so

996
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,599
there's a heat interaction at one

997
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:02,480
temperature with the fluid element on

998
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:02,480
its left and another heat

999
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,480
interaction at a different temperature

1000
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,160
slightly different temperature with the

1001
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,480
element on the

1002
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:14,680
right and for the moment let's assume

1003
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:18,680
that this is in a steady

1004
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,680
state so let's do the energy

1005
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:28,520
balance and we do the energy balance per

1006
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:33,000
unit of area of the surface of of um

1007
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,000
interaction between these adjacent

1008
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:40,400
elements so zero because we are at

1009
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,520
steady state so there is no accumulation

1010
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,480
of energy

1011
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:49,359
um otherwise here it would be the

1012
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,400
derivative of uh of the energy per unit

1013
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:54,319
volume

1014
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,880
divided with respect to time but it's

1015
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,799
zero because we are assuming steady

1016
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,359
state

1017
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,880
is equal

1018
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:03,839
to the heat flux I'm going I'm using

1019
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,480
here the notation of heat transfer so

1020
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:09,640
qou Prime is the typical notation for

1021
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,640
heat transfer

1022
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:17,200
uh and then we have a heat flux at X

1023
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,119
Plus

1024
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,119
DX so you may recognize this is the

1025
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:23,119
incremental

1026
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,920
uh the increment of of the function Q

1027
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:33,839
Prime is a function of X so this is the

1028
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:38,280
partial of Q Prime with respect to X

1029
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,280
time DX and it is equal to

1030
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:45,520
zero and then we do the entropy

1031
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,799
balance remember we're doing the balance

1032
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,799
for this element in the

1033
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:56,359
center so here we have to account for

1034
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,240
here I multiplied by a okay so we have

1035
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:00,200
to account for the entropy coming in

1036
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,720
from the

1037
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,720
left which is Q dot over

1038
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:13,000
t

1039
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:18,240
uh and qou Prime is Q do over a is the

1040
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,240
flux so this is the heat rate per unit

1041
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:24,880
area minus the uh entropy that goes uh

1042
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:28,440
out on the other

1043
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:30,079
side and this is Q Prime divided by the

1044
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,839
temperature which prevails there which

1045
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:36,039
is different slightly but different

1046
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:37,280
different and then plus the entropy

1047
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,200
produced by

1048
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,559
irreversibility so here I'm going

1049
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:47,079
denoting this lower case s with the

1050
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:49,520
triple prime is entropy generated by

1051
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:52,480
reversibility per unit

1052
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:55,200
volume and the dot is the right so

1053
00:57:52,480 --> 00:58:01,079
that's soon we will go actually already

1054
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:05,480
here we give a a a special symbol for

1055
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:08,960
that so we use from one from now on when

1056
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:11,680
we you see Sigma it's not it's not the

1057
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,000
stress tensor it's not the surface

1058
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,240
tension it's the rate of entropy

1059
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,160
production per

1060
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,280
unit sometimes different fields uh use

1061
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:27,160
the same symbol for different purposes

1062
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,160
but uh there is only one Greek alphabet

1063
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,640
okay so from this

1064
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:41,079
one if you do properly this

1065
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,760
uh use this

1066
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:48,799
and recognize the

1067
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,760
incremental TX plus DX minus TX ided by

1068
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,880
DX that's the derivative of t with

1069
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,799
respect to

1070
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:57,640
X and the

1071
00:58:54,799 --> 00:59:00,160
denominator um

1072
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,680
here you can neglect the

1073
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,720
difference

1074
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,440
of and so this denominator you can

1075
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,160
simply call it t^ s that's why the

1076
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,480
approximate

1077
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:16,280
symbol

1078
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:19,599
okay okay so we like uh to write this as

1079
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:22,520
a so the entropy production

1080
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,720
rate you we write to write it as the as

1081
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,160
the flux heat flux times this gradient

1082
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:31,400
of the inverse

1083
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:34,240
temperature this will is analogous and

1084
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:39,000
this is why we we are doing it now it's

1085
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:42,599
analogous to the chemical um um idea

1086
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,520
that right entropy production rates are

1087
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:47,240
given by a product

1088
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:51,359
of reaction rate times an affinity if

1089
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:54,160
you interpret this gradient of uh the

1090
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:57,599
inverse temperature as the

1091
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,400
Affinity or the degree of this

1092
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:03,119
equilibrium

1093
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:09,039
in with respect to heat

1094
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:11,599
transfer then you have a similar

1095
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,559
concept and we have already discussed

1096
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:19,000
this in a previous lecture so I will not

1097
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:22,960
do it now but I simply remind you that

1098
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,520
this part of the slide was to

1099
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,559
um uh show

1100
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,880
that

1101
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:35,000
um you cannot be at

1102
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:38,640
equilibrium if this is different from

1103
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,640
zero and

1104
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,880
therefore when we actually

1105
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,359
adopt an

1106
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:50,039
equilibrium local equilibrium model for

1107
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:54,039
our fluid element we are neglecting this

1108
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:58,400
difference and you will see uh hopefully

1109
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:00,200
uh today uh we will see what that uh

1110
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,720
what accounting for that

1111
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:06,280
difference uh

1112
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:08,760
makes uh and how things change if you do

1113
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,720
account for that but for the

1114
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,760
moment if you want you just go back to

1115
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:18,480
that previous lecture to

1116
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:22,799
find more discussion about this this

1117
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:26,839
graph what we may uh

1118
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:29,640
also add is the following

1119
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:31,480
now this fluid element in the middle of

1120
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:34,520
two things that are at different

1121
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:37,559
temperatures although minute

1122
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:40,039
differences uh could be in

1123
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:44,079
principle see that was a that was that

1124
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:46,640
heat transfer uh direct with with no

1125
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,280
useful effect is dissipative and in fact

1126
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,039
you have entropy produced by

1127
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:52,680
reversibility and we have learned that

1128
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:55,319
whenever you have entropy produced by

1129
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,440
reversibility you could if you have if

1130
01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:00,799
you can avoid that entropy production

1131
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,599
you can do something useful with it so

1132
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:05,480
here what you would uh what what you

1133
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,400
would need to do is to replace your

1134
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,279
fluid element

1135
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,880
by a small heat engine a

1136
01:02:10,279 --> 01:02:16,400
local uh

1137
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:20,039
something maybe bacteria maybe um

1138
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:24,039
because here it maybe a small small

1139
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:29,119
system in any case a heat engine

1140
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:31,839
that while uh uh exploiting this

1141
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:35,559
temperature difference extracts some

1142
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:35,559
work like a Carno

1143
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:45,599
engine uh we have learned that in order

1144
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,160
to compute this the maximum work you

1145
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:51,480
have to do energy balance and entropy

1146
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,799
balance and you have to assume that the

1147
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,279
entropy produced by irreversibility is

1148
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:58,279
equal to zero if you do that so you

1149
01:02:56,279 --> 01:03:01,599
start from the entropy balance and

1150
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:01,599
impose that this the

1151
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,480
derivative that the entropy that goes

1152
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,960
out here is equal to the entropy that

1153
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,960
comes

1154
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:17,240
in

1155
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:20,240
uh that gives

1156
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,160
you one relation then if you substitute

1157
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:27,760
it back into the energy balance it gives

1158
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,760
you uh that maximum work

1159
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,960
and of course the answer we could have

1160
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,039
done it even without redoing the energy

1161
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:38,240
and entropy balances it the answer is

1162
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:41,200
that the maximum work you extract there

1163
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,599
is equal to the to the

1164
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,720
temperature that prevails around there

1165
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:51,400
more or less is the

1166
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:53,960
same so T times the entropy times Sigma

1167
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,520
times the entropy that you uh you would

1168
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,599
have produced by IR ibility if you

1169
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:04,680
didn't do that

1170
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,680
work okay so you get this relation

1171
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,200
here

1172
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:15,000
um if your fluid element is in is a is

1173
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:18,200
is three dimensional instead of of if

1174
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:23,319
you okay here we've

1175
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:23,319
discussed uh a onedimensional

1176
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,760
case but if you

1177
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:32,599
you can make it also

1178
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:36,599
three-dimensional so you you have a nice

1179
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:40,880
uh a nice uh fluid elements of the kind

1180
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:46,000
that you consider in in 3D heat transfer

1181
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:48,359
then of course you have to account for

1182
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,559
exchanges uh

1183
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:56,400
of heat the heat flux is a vector that

1184
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:59,760
has the three components

1185
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,960
and the equivalent of the energy balance

1186
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:06,119
here this derivative of Q respect to X

1187
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:10,559
is equal to zero becomes the the

1188
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:14,200
Divergence of the vector Q Prime is

1189
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:18,920
equal to zero or in this other problem

1190
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:22,160
it becomes the Divergence of Q overt of

1191
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:27,240
the vector Q overt which is the entropy

1192
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,240
flux uh is equal to zero

1193
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:36,279
and uh this expression for the entropy

1194
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:41,119
production rate per unit

1195
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:44,359
volume if from this uh which is just the

1196
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,520
X component of the heat flux times the X

1197
01:05:44,359 --> 01:05:51,119
component of the gradient in one / T it

1198
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:55,240
becomes the dot product the scalar

1199
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:58,000
product of the heat flux into the

1200
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:01,079
gradient of 1/ T which is a

1201
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,279
vector so I like this is why I like to

1202
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:10,720
put the underline uh into under the

1203
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:10,720
nabla symbol because nabla is a vector

1204
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:19,799
operator like Q okay I'm sure you are

1205
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,799
familiar with

1206
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:27,559
that so

1207
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,559
nabla is this operator here

1208
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:38,039
it's a vector which has as components

1209
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:38,039
the partial derivative

1210
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,079
symbols all right so we have seen the

1211
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,039
analogy in the

1212
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,880
structure for the rate of entropy

1213
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,119
production

1214
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,680
with the chemical

1215
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:06,240
U

1216
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:09,760
formalism Affinity times rate Affinity

1217
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:12,599
times rate rate of heat rate of heat

1218
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,559
exchange and so the Affinity is the

1219
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:17,079
gradient in the

1220
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,960
temperature so if we do let's do the

1221
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:22,240
same

1222
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:25,160
procedure let us

1223
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,880
assume like we did that the Epsilon dot

1224
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:31,319
is a fun function of the Infinity with

1225
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:33,359
the function being zero at equilibrium

1226
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:35,279
let's assume the same here so let's

1227
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:42,319
assume that the

1228
01:07:35,279 --> 01:07:46,039
heat flux Vector is a function of the

1229
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:46,039
gradient of the inverse

1230
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:51,400
temperature and it is equal to zero if

1231
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,839
there is no

1232
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,839
gradient because we know that if the

1233
01:07:53,839 --> 01:08:00,839
temperature profile is flat there's no

1234
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:04,000
gradient there is no heat flux okay and

1235
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:06,279
we linearize this expression here like

1236
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,520
we did

1237
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:11,720
here so you take this

1238
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:15,440
derivative and so the derivative of

1239
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:18,560
vector respect to another Vector becomes

1240
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:23,319
tensor we call it

1241
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,319
l double underline it's for a

1242
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:31,640
tensor and the first term in the and so

1243
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:34,159
you're linearizing in in gradient of one

1244
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,480
/ T so that multiplies gradient of one

1245
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:38,839
over T and of course this tensor is to

1246
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,600
be evaluated at equilibrium so this is

1247
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:44,679
an equilibrium

1248
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,000
property you would evaluate this when

1249
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:48,520
there is no gradient when the

1250
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,520
temperature is

1251
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:56,799
flat well if you call that

1252
01:08:54,120 --> 01:09:02,799
L uh

1253
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:06,400
K tensor times t^ s you obtain the for

1254
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,400
of thermal uh

1255
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,199
conduction

1256
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:17,520
okay on which most of the heat transfer

1257
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:21,880
is

1258
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,279
based so this is a fundamental step then

1259
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:27,279
from this you construct all the

1260
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:27,279
applications

1261
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:35,880
notice that uh K is is a tensor first of

1262
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,679
all and

1263
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:42,719
only in some special

1264
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:47,640
cases uh that tensor is isotropic so you

1265
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:51,839
need only one one variable to represent

1266
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:54,080
it so for an isotropic material then you

1267
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:59,520
can write uh

1268
01:09:54,080 --> 01:10:01,560
that you Q Prime I'm sorry Q Prime is

1269
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:05,320
equal to minus

1270
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:08,280
K the gradient of of

1271
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:14,280
T that's because of course the gradient

1272
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:19,520
of uh 1 / T is equal to minus 1 / T ^ 2

1273
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:19,520
* the gradient of T okay

1274
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:36,239
so that is the uh standard the forier

1275
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,960
law of proportionality heat and so that

1276
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:41,239
it says that the heat flux is in the in

1277
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,360
the direction of of

1278
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:46,280
the the

1279
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:48,760
gradient

1280
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:52,560
right and that's true for an isotropic

1281
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:57,239
material but for an an anisotropic

1282
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:57,239
material you may have

1283
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:06,360
that the gradient is in One Direction

1284
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:06,360
and The U heat flux is in another

1285
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,040
direction for example here suppose you

1286
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:17,040
have a

1287
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:21,560
two-dimensional problem in which you

1288
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:24,159
have a two-dimensional anisotropic

1289
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:27,239
material um and so the two- dimensional

1290
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,239
means that uh

1291
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:33,679
whatever uh nothing changes with the Z

1292
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,400
Direction neither the temperature nor

1293
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,639
the heat flux nor the boundary

1294
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,239
conditions in that case every everything

1295
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:42,040
that every partial derivative with

1296
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:45,600
respect to Z is equal to zero that's

1297
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:47,719
condition for 2D symmetri of

1298
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,800
things so for example the temperature

1299
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:54,840
field depends only on X and Y that's to

1300
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:56,159
simplify and here so this is this

1301
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,239
expression

1302
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:01,239
the for La

1303
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:05,239
becomes this linear expression

1304
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:09,480
here and how do you build nonisotropic

1305
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:12,639
materials for example by sandwiching uh

1306
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:15,320
layers of different materials for

1307
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:19,960
example you could have a a highly

1308
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:22,159
conductive layer of material like carbon

1309
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:26,159
sheet uh

1310
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:26,159
in sandwiched

1311
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:33,800
between an epoxy or some other material

1312
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:33,800
with low

1313
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,360
conductivity that makes an

1314
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:49,920
isotropy okay so these are the equations

1315
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,920
let's see how you would

1316
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:56,159
uh so in order to characterize this

1317
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:56,159
material

1318
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:05,840
uh don't just have one thermal

1319
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:08,639
conductivity you need to measure three

1320
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,679
parameters or actually there are four

1321
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:15,480
entries in The

1322
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:19,199
Matrix but thanks to onager

1323
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:22,800
principle the off diagonal ones must be

1324
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:24,600
equal because of it his reciprocity

1325
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,159
General reciprocity theorem which

1326
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,360
applies all also in this

1327
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:31,320
business and therefore you need only to

1328
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,080
measure three and here are the three

1329
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:37,159
measurements that you could

1330
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:42,960
make you cut the sample of your

1331
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:42,960
material thin in the X

1332
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:54,639
Direction and assume that uh things in

1333
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:57,679
the y direction do not change or set up

1334
01:13:54,639 --> 01:14:00,880
in EXP expent in which they don't

1335
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:05,040
change and then so that you are set up

1336
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,800
to use the first equation here with no

1337
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,560
component of the gradient in temperature

1338
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:12,159
in the y direction this is zero and you

1339
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:14,440
have only the this direct relation so

1340
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:17,000
you measure the heat flux you measure

1341
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:20,920
the gradient in temperature the across

1342
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:24,280
the small thickness of your sample and

1343
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:29,880
you take that ratio uh and uh so this

1344
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:33,440
ratio gives you the conductivity the

1345
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:35,760
XX component of the conductivity tensor

1346
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:40,159
that must be

1347
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:43,520
positive because uh this

1348
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:46,800
tensor is is a onager matrix so it is to

1349
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,400
be positive semide

1350
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:56,000
definite do the same for the y direction

1351
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:56,000
and and and and you measure kou y

1352
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:05,760
uh now to measure the off diagonal terms

1353
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:08,600
one way is to put your

1354
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:12,440
sample you squeeze

1355
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:15,360
it uh between

1356
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:19,320
insulating um

1357
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:22,800
materials in the uh two faces on the

1358
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:25,159
with the direction in the Y Direction

1359
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:29,520
with the normal in the y direction okay

1360
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:29,520
so this is a an insulation this is an

1361
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:41,360
insulation and you subject your sample

1362
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:41,360
to a gradient in temperature in the uh X

1363
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:50,480
Direction

1364
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:54,600
okay now since the insulating material

1365
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:55,639
uh since this um wall is insulated the

1366
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,719
Heat

1367
01:15:55,639 --> 01:16:01,400
component in the Y the y direction here

1368
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:03,560
is zero and also here is zero so you can

1369
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:07,280
assume that it is zero

1370
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:09,880
also uh not really precise but that it

1371
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:13,679
is zero also in in between because this

1372
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:15,920
is supposed to be a small thickness of

1373
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,920
your

1374
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,560
sample

1375
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:25,040
however in spite of that so there is no

1376
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,320
heat flux in the vertical Direction

1377
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:31,840
Direction yet you're going to build up a

1378
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,840
gradient in temperature in that

1379
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:39,920
direction

1380
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,600
because of uh this equation here which

1381
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,320
is Rewritten

1382
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:48,679
here the insulation sets this equal to

1383
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,000
zero and therefore makes these two terms

1384
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:53,120
equal to one

1385
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,120
another I mean equal and opposite to one

1386
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,120
another

1387
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:02,480
so by measuring the gradient in

1388
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:05,880
temperature that that builds up in the y

1389
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:08,239
direction and dividing by dividing it by

1390
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:12,400
the imposed gradient in temperature in

1391
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:14,199
the X Direction you get this ratio of

1392
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,920
the off diagonal

1393
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:20,920
coefficient versus the direct

1394
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,920
coefficient okay

1395
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:32,960
and in fact you notice that u in this

1396
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:34,560
case the X Direction component of the

1397
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,840
heat

1398
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:41,199
flux Q Prime

1399
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,199
X is

1400
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:50,960
less than it was in this other example

1401
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:52,840
in this other situation because you see

1402
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,440
the the the there is still

1403
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:58,960
proportionality between the flux

1404
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:02,480
and the imposed gradient in the X

1405
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:05,760
Direction but the coefficient of

1406
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,760
proportionality is

1407
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:16,199
smaller physically you can you can

1408
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:18,840
realize that uh this sandwich makes it

1409
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:22,600
so that the heat

1410
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:25,679
flux finds it easier to run through the

1411
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:28,199
high conductivity uh

1412
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:31,840
layers and since those layers are

1413
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:35,960
inclined as hinted by these inclined

1414
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:40,360
lines here uh the heat flux enters here

1415
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:42,400
but it it likes to go up in following

1416
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:45,280
the

1417
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:48,880
um the high conductivity

1418
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:52,440
materials that's why you build up

1419
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:56,719
temperature gradient in the direction uh

1420
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,719
where there is no heat uh net heat flux

1421
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,960
all right

1422
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:10,320
so this uh is also called riluk

1423
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:15,120
effect which was discovered before on

1424
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:17,320
Sager theorem many of the uh things that

1425
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,000
are rationalized by the onager

1426
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:22,600
reciprocity theorem were actually

1427
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,239
discovered independently and not uh

1428
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,440
sometimes not even connected to one

1429
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:29,960
another

1430
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:32,199
uh by uh various researchers in the 19th

1431
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:35,920
century and

1432
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:39,440
U it's only later on that you could

1433
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:42,960
connect them and so it's somehow you had

1434
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:45,560
four different effects that thanks to on

1435
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,320
Sager were related and become only three

1436
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,320
independent

1437
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:56,040
ones notice also that for example using

1438
01:19:53,040 --> 01:20:01,679
this uh idea

1439
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:01,679
you can construct a sensor a

1440
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:09,040
non-disturbing heat heat flux

1441
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,080
sensor

1442
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:14,520
uh

1443
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:16,960
because in here by putting the

1444
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,920
thermocouples across the

1445
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:22,639
sample which are off the way the where

1446
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,239
the heat flux

1447
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:27,840
goes by measuring this temperature

1448
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:30,000
different difference you measure you

1449
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:33,239
measure the heat

1450
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,760
flux and

1451
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:37,880
therefore uh you don't have to put

1452
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,760
thermocouples in the way of a small

1453
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:42,639
sample because the typically if you put

1454
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:45,199
the thermocouple that will disturb the

1455
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:49,159
measurement because the thermocouple has

1456
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:52,159
it own size and therefore it uh it

1457
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:56,159
Alters the actual

1458
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:56,159
situation okay

1459
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,120
of course

1460
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:10,360
in the Fier uh equation

1461
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:16,080
of so the the complete energy

1462
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,719
balance for

1463
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:29,159
a for a for a

1464
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:31,600
uh with with no uh no motion no velocity

1465
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:35,360
so not not a gas or a fluid but say

1466
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:38,840
solid or maybe a static

1467
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:45,000
fluid this is the

1468
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:49,120
U equation and if you have for example a

1469
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:56,520
gas uh okay this

1470
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:56,520
U uh row U is the okay let's say that uh

1471
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:06,280
rou is the energy per unit

1472
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:11,800
volume okay so you could write it as

1473
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:18,000
as M over V * U over

1474
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:18,000
M and so by seeing that you see this is

1475
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:25,120
wrw and this is U so here I'm using U

1476
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:30,000
without the star the asteris

1477
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:35,120
but that's the uh energy per unit

1478
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:38,360
Mass so specific energy per unit

1479
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:41,440
mass and for example for a gas that

1480
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:45,880
would be row

1481
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:50,120
uh CV times

1482
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:50,120
t or at least the

1483
01:22:52,120 --> 01:23:01,159
derivative with respect to time of r u

1484
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:01,159
can be written as uh this derivative

1485
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:06,159
here and if the density is constant and

1486
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:10,320
the specific heat is constant it goes

1487
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:13,679
out of the derivative and you get only

1488
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:16,040
uh uh row

1489
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:18,280
CV DT

1490
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,840
oft minus the

1491
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:25,280
gradient

1492
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:28,400
of uh Q okay Q is

1493
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,679
uh for your equation if you have an

1494
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,719
isotropic

1495
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:36,280
material if it is a okay let's keep it

1496
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:40,639
as a Tropic just simplicity so I have to

1497
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:44,719
M to substitute here minus K times the

1498
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:49,600
gradient in t Okay so that makes

1499
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:53,560
it if K this requires that K be

1500
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:55,679
independent of of space of temperature

1501
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:58,239
so if K is a constant it goes out of

1502
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:02,320
this otherwise you have to keep it

1503
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:05,400
inside so if K is constant because con

1504
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,960
because uh the conductivity of materials

1505
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:11,320
does change with temperature so this

1506
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:13,560
step may not be always allowed but if

1507
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:17,400
you do that this

1508
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:20,600
becomes um the laash of the temperature

1509
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:23,960
because you know that the gradient

1510
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:26,280
dotted into the gradient gives the laian

1511
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,960
operation

1512
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:30,520
if you dot this Vector into another

1513
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:34,199
Vector equal to

1514
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:35,880
itself the dot product gives you uh the

1515
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:38,400
products of the components of the

1516
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,800
vectors and so here you have the partial

1517
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,280
of x times another partial of X so

1518
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,119
that's the second derivative with

1519
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:51,520
respect to X twice and those are uh the

1520
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:55,880
various ingredients the three uh of that

1521
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,880
represent uh the LA

1522
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:09,239
okay all right so in any case this is

1523
01:25:07,239 --> 01:25:13,840
the equation of

1524
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:13,840
Fier the for energy energy

1525
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:22,080
balance and

1526
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:23,320
um yeah um there is a if you have

1527
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:26,000
nonisotropic

1528
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:29,360
material

1529
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,480
material there is an interesting change

1530
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:37,960
of coordinates if we have seen

1531
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:39,600
that the the heat flux and the gradient

1532
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,600
temperature are not in the

1533
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,600
same

1534
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:50,600
direction and there is

1535
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:54,800
a a change of

1536
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:57,800
coordinates that you can do

1537
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:01,440
uh so Define nonorthogonal coordinates

1538
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:04,920
instead of the usual orthogonal X and Y

1539
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:07,080
small X and Y you can define capital X

1540
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,639
and Y here

1541
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:14,199
actually this is wrong it's not there is

1542
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:15,800
no equal sign here this is just the

1543
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:17,920
multiplication so that's the linear

1544
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:20,560
combination of the original coordinates

1545
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:23,280
to give these

1546
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:27,040
um coordinates with are at a certain

1547
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:29,440
angle between one another and if you

1548
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:31,040
write it that way then

1549
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:35,920
the

1550
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:38,440
equation um the the laion in terms of

1551
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,880
the new coordinates becomes like that

1552
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:43,760
for

1553
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:48,440
a uniform

1554
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:49,360
material and um where K is equal the

1555
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,600
effective

1556
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,480
conductivity uniform conductivity is

1557
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,440
equal to this linear combination of the

1558
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:58,520
various

1559
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,679
uh term so this is the it's like the the

1560
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:05,880
gradient I mean the the square root of

1561
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:08,880
the of the determinant of the

1562
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,960
tensor conductivity tensor and also the

1563
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,440
heat

1564
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:14,400
flux a vector in the original

1565
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:16,920
coordinates it becomes a linear

1566
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,600
combination also here there is should be

1567
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:20,679
I have to correct this it shouldn't be

1568
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:25,199
an equal sign it's just a multiplication

1569
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:28,159
sign and it gives the um

1570
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,159
the the

1571
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:35,520
flux component in this new nonorthogonal

1572
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:37,600
coordinates and they are related through

1573
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,360
that uh

1574
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:44,600
conductivity directly so there are no

1575
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:47,239
off diagonal terms okay so this is just

1576
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:50,760
a useful change of coordinates but there

1577
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:52,719
is one last uh item that I wanted I

1578
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:57,639
promise I would

1579
01:27:52,719 --> 01:28:00,639
discuss which has to do with this

1580
01:27:57,639 --> 01:28:04,800
problem that if you

1581
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:07,920
are dealing with the heat

1582
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:13,320
transfer there is this

1583
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:13,320
conundrum of the fact that

1584
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:21,320
um the

1585
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:24,159
entropy that you cannot be at

1586
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,760
equilibrium uh and in fact the so the

1587
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:28,840
entropy of

1588
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:33,239
your sample or your

1589
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:36,239
material is off the equilibrium so

1590
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:38,600
assigning it the equilibrium entropy

1591
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:44,199
introduces an error and it's interesting

1592
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:49,080
to see how you now solve that problem uh

1593
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:52,639
by assuming uh instead assigning to the

1594
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:55,480
fluid element or continum element not

1595
01:28:52,639 --> 01:29:01,080
the equilibrium entropy but an entropy

1596
01:28:55,480 --> 01:29:01,080
Which is less than equilibrium and it

1597
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:06,800
is departs from equilibrium more the

1598
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:08,760
higher the heat transfer so we make it

1599
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,960
through a proportionality constant which

1600
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:14,080
I for convenience called B over2 uh

1601
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:16,480
proportional to the modulus of the

1602
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,320
square of the heat transfer so clearly

1603
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:21,480
if you're at equilibrium there is no

1604
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:23,600
heat transfer and this

1605
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:26,560
difference so the entropy is that over

1606
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,840
equ but the higher the heat transfer the

1607
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,760
farther you are from

1608
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:34,040
equilibrium so if I take the

1609
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:35,679
differential of this one uh it gives me

1610
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:38,000
the differential of the equilibrium

1611
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:39,119
State plus the differential of that

1612
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
which

1613
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:49,119
is so the two goes away it's B Q doq

1614
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,639
Plus q. DQ plus DQ doq so it's twice Q

1615
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:52,800
do

1616
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:56,040
DQ

1617
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,040
okay now

1618
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:03,920
the this is important because if we do

1619
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:06,719
the um the entropy

1620
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:10,280
balance like we wrote the energy balance

1621
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:14,400
here we should write also the entropy

1622
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:18,159
balance and that is given by the

1623
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:21,520
Divergence of the heat of the entropy

1624
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:26,000
flux uh which is Q over

1625
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:28,360
t plus uh the rate of entropy production

1626
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,600
uh per unit

1627
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:33,800
volume which is

1628
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:38,159
Sigma now usually these

1629
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:41,639
two are related through the Gibs the

1630
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:43,920
Gibs relation the Gibs relation is you

1631
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:50,600
can write it as

1632
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:55,600
the S = 1 / t d of row

1633
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:59,280
U and uh there is

1634
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:03,560
I like to write it in terms of entropy

1635
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:06,000
per unit volume is that in this way from

1636
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:09,320
the Gibbs relation we'll see more later

1637
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,199
about this uh the pressure disappears

1638
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:16,600
the pressure is always a bit problematic

1639
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:20,400
to treat so if you find a way that it it

1640
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,960
disappears uh it's better okay so if

1641
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,400
this is true for the differential

1642
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:27,639
differential it means all possible

1643
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,480
changes in all directions it's true also

1644
01:31:27,639 --> 01:31:33,440
if you take the derivative with respect

1645
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:36,119
to time so just move uh only with

1646
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:41,400
respect to time so this can also be

1647
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:41,400
written as partial with respect to

1648
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:48,119
T and is 1 / T * the partial with

1649
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:53,199
respect to T overall

1650
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:56,199
U okay and yeah this is short end for

1651
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:59,040
the partial with respect to time and so

1652
01:31:56,199 --> 01:32:03,119
this the Gibs relation couples the

1653
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:04,360
energy uh and the entropy balance and so

1654
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:06,600
in that

1655
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:11,280
way and this is

1656
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:14,480
actually what I just uh

1657
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:16,400
wrote yes I should no this is true

1658
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,840
because the GS relation is valid for

1659
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:24,199
equilibrium so this is true for the E

1660
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:28,239
for the equilibrium entropy s SA

1661
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:32,280
or S Sub s stable equilibrium

1662
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:35,159
State yeah here I should just unify the

1663
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,159
notation

1664
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:40,840
anyway so if you do this

1665
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,600
substitution and you can obtain the

1666
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:45,760
expression for the entropy production

1667
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:49,119
which is the product of the heat flux

1668
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:55,280
times this thing so this not only the

1669
01:32:49,119 --> 01:33:01,360
gradient in one / t uh but there is also

1670
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:06,159
B uh a q dot b times derivative with

1671
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:06,159
respect to T of Q which comes from

1672
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:15,080
here so this term in in in square

1673
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:17,280
brackets is now the

1674
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:20,280
Affinity so the Affinity change the

1675
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:25,000
expression for the Affinity has

1676
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:29,639
changed and if we assume a linear

1677
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,639
relation between flux and

1678
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:35,159
Affinity

1679
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:38,199
through positive constant

1680
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:42,600
L what we obtain is a

1681
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:43,320
correction to the F law of conduction

1682
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,920
which

1683
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,719
was proposed by

1684
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,480
katano which gives rise to the katano

1685
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:54,400
heat equation

1686
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:56,760
1948 katano didn't uh start

1687
01:33:54,400 --> 01:34:00,159
from these premises he wanted to fix

1688
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:03,800
another problem that I'm describing in a

1689
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:08,239
second but so uh let's let's take this

1690
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:11,639
one and then substitute back into the

1691
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:16,320
energy balance equation so we have an

1692
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:20,719
expression for qou Prime you can take uh

1693
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:24,040
the the Divergence of that and that

1694
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:27,719
gives you this term

1695
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:30,920
which is like typical for but also it

1696
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:33,280
takes it's the gradient I mean the the

1697
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,560
the Divergence of the partial derivative

1698
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,119
with respect to

1699
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:39,400
T diverence of this

1700
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:41,360
contribution you can

1701
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,840
switch

1702
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:45,639
different partial derivative with

1703
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:48,520
respect to time with have the partial

1704
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:52,119
derivatives with respect to

1705
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:55,800
space and uh and so this also appears

1706
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:58,639
and again using the energy balance is is

1707
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:00,280
the partial with respect to time of r u

1708
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:04,199
so you have the double partial with

1709
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:05,960
respect to time which if you then

1710
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:09,679
substitute

1711
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:12,080
um this expression for the for the

1712
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:15,960
specific Heats and the

1713
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:19,199
density uh then can be Rewritten in this

1714
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:22,920
way so in other words you will

1715
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:25,440
obtain an equation with double second

1716
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:27,679
derivative uh with respect to time of

1717
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,800
the temperature first derivative respect

1718
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:35,440
to time and then the usual if you didn't

1719
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:37,880
have that term you would have the

1720
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:39,719
standard

1721
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,679
for

1722
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:47,560
equation but with that term things

1723
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:51,199
change and it becomes a dumped wave

1724
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:54,360
equation and it actually

1725
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:57,000
fixes a a problem the probably I'm sure

1726
01:35:54,360 --> 01:36:00,199
you're familiar with uh this problem

1727
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:04,679
from heat transfer in which you have

1728
01:36:00,199 --> 01:36:08,119
semi infinite uh solid which is

1729
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:12,159
initially at a certain temperature T

1730
01:36:08,119 --> 01:36:15,760
t0 and at time equal zero you um

1731
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:19,000
suddenly change and keep from from then

1732
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,800
on the temperature temperature here on

1733
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,360
the

1734
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:27,600
surface uh as a result you obtain Pro

1735
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:30,440
temperature profiles that look like that

1736
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:34,080
given by the error function uh

1737
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:36,960
distribution uh with SP

1738
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:40,480
with and as time goes on the

1739
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:44,840
distribution goes like that so as time

1740
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:47,880
proceeds but what is the problem the non

1741
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:52,320
physical problem is that already start

1742
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:54,280
starting from time0 plus when the error

1743
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:56,600
function uh

1744
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,600
sets

1745
01:36:57,199 --> 01:37:02,040
on it turns out that since the error

1746
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:05,800
function

1747
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:09,840
is is non zero everywhere it turns out

1748
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:12,360
that maybe minute but you still have a

1749
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:17,320
an infinite prop propagation rate of

1750
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:21,760
what you have done uh here which is UN

1751
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:25,600
physical uh because there is no

1752
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:29,119
infinite if you you do something here

1753
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:34,040
now it it is unphysical to think that it

1754
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:37,000
is felt immediately at infinite

1755
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:40,000
distance uh so the katano equation

1756
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:44,320
solves this uh

1757
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:48,119
problem and in fact uh this Pro so this

1758
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:51,480
equation has been used to represent the

1759
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:54,360
Early times of this sharp change of

1760
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:57,000
temperature problem or

1761
01:37:54,360 --> 01:38:00,599
uh situations in which

1762
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:05,400
you change the uh boundary conditions

1763
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:10,760
very quickly and therefore

1764
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:14,000
uh you need to to to account for a a

1765
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:18,320
propagation speed which is this

1766
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:20,480
coefficient here becomes now the wave

1767
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:25,440
celarity and the

1768
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:25,440
gamma becomes The Dumping coefficient

1769
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:35,599
okay

1770
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:38,480
and okay so yeah yeah um so time is up

1771
01:38:35,599 --> 01:38:41,719
and uh I think we should stop uh here

1772
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,719
for today
