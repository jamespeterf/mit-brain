00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,240
Hi everyone. I'm delighted to be here to

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,160
present the startup lightning talks.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
Today we're showcasing some of the

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,199
newest startups that have recently uh

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,000
joined Startup Exchange. They're all

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,560
working in the AI space and they focus

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
on a wide range of industries from

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,920
manufacturing to transportation,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,760
insurance, forestry and others.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,719
Application wise, this is a pretty

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,800
diverse uh group too with applications

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,920
ranging from workflow automation

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,399
uh infrastructure safety, human behavior

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,239
um among others. With this broad

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
selection of startups, we want to give

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,760
you an idea of the technologies emerging

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,640
from MIT. We believe these technologies

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
and businesses have the power to solve

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
some of the challenges you're likely

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,039
facing and can contribute to the growth

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,480
of your

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,239
businesses. They are going to show us

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,040
some of the use cases they've been

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,040
working on with partners and customers.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,439
And one thing they need more of is

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,920
customers like you. So I encourage you

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,600
to meet them throughout the day and

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,960
start discussing uh potential joint

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,960
opportunities. And this is that's what

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,360
we do at Startup Exchange. We bring

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,920
together MIT connected startups and

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,320
industry to help you foster some kind of

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
collaborations and partnerships. We do

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,640
that in a few different ways as you'll

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,119
find out in a moment. So uh the startups

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,000
we support all of them have a strong

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,920
connection with MIT. In some cases the

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
connection comes through the founding

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,479
team in other cases through the

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,600
technology. And we also support startups

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,920
that although don't have origin at MIT,

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,479
they are vetted and supported by some of

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,680
our peers which then makes them eligible

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:01,520
to us. In this case, by peers I mean

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:05,439
Cale Startup Connect plus engine um um

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,840
and I'm blanking on one

47
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,840
center

48
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:16,319
if start on Nano. Thank you very

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,920
much. Um then uh our network uh

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,239
currently has uh about close to a

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,120
thousand startups virtually working in

52
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,480
any sector and we're also location

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,560
agnostic. So uh in our portfolio we have

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,840
companies that are based here but as

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,239
well spread throughout the world. Now

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,800
everything we do at Startup Exchange is

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,599
to expose and connect startups and

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,760
industry in a highly created way and we

59
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,400
also provide learning opportunities to

60
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,480
both parties. This includes launching

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,680
calls for startups based on corporate's

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,840
own priorities and challenges,

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,280
facilitating one-on-one meetings between

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,160
both parties, hosting uh virtual demo

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,239
days, although these typically tend to

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,640
take place once a quarter, but this year

67
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,360
we have a special live edition that is

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,000
taking place tomorrow, and other formats

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,720
of events. The learning opportunities

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,840
can take different formats as well from

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,519
workshops, training sessions and these

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,760
we tend to coorganize with peers such as

73
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,360
the Martin Trust Center for MIT

74
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,480
entrepreneurship

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:32,560
um uh E14, Sandbox, VMS uh and

76
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,040
others. This slide features a small

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
sample of the success cases we had to

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,640
date. again all focused on

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,879
collaborations and partnerships that um

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,120
and the ones we see taking shape more

81
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:50,319
often are proofs of concept pilots uh

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,159
joint development and even acquisitions.

83
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,920
This is startup exchange in a nutshell.

84
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,200
If you'd like to learn more about it,

85
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,640
please do reach out during the

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,480
breaks. And now before passing the word

87
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,599
to the entrepreneurs, I'd like to invite

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,519
you to our upcoming events. Tomorrow

89
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,120
we're hosting two additional events

90
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,599
dedicated to AI. We are at capacity, but

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,480
you can still register to get your uh

92
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,040
link a link to the live stream. Then on

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,320
April 10, we're hosting a new leading

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,240
edge webinar this time around about

95
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,479
computationally assisted materials. And

96
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,040
then on May 8, we're back with a new

97
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,199
edition of the Health Science Forum.

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
And now it is my pleasure to kick off

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,440
the startup lightning talks. Each

100
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,280
entrepreneur is presenting for five

101
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
minutes and then at the end you can meet

102
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,680
them all uh at the startup exhibit that

103
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,680
is taking place uh in the room next

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,680
door.
