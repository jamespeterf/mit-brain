1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
okay good

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,559
morning

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,279
so we are still here in

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,279
studying uh cross

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,199
effects that

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,360
emerge from

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:38,239
the on Sager theory

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,239
of know equilibrium near

9
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:47,360
equilibrium as a result of linear

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,360
relations between forces and

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,160
flaxes just as a

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,360
reminder in this slide we uh got these

13
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,520
uh Expressions that

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,240
summarize uh the relation between

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,560
U energy

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,320
flux and entropy flux and constituents

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,840
flux

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:25,000
including Uh current electrical charge

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,759
flux uh and these

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,079
are diffusive flues so they are relative

21
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,000
to uh

22
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:39,759
the if you if we have a motion like in a

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,200
fluid they relative to the body center

24
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,200
of the fluid

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,680
parcels and this other slide

26
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,680
also which we have reviewed the last

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,719
time allowed us to

28
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:07,599
write the this term uh uh in the uh

29
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:10,759
expression for the rate of entropy

30
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,480
production in terms of independent

31
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:18,160
fluxes

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:23,360
or actually in terms of this ji JS these

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:27,160
are differences between um fluxes of

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,040
pairs of uh constituents that are

35
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,760
present in our system

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,959
and they go together so the conjugated

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,120
Force to this U diffusive relative

38
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,800
fluxes are uh we could call them

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,360
diffusive relative forces and they are

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,200
uh given by the difference in the

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,080
gradients of the chemical potentials of

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,800
the same two

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:00,159
uh kinds of

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,840
particles notice that

45
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,360
these by definition are

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,480
anti-symmetric so you change you swap

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
the IND indexes you change the sign of

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,239
course

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,959
because it's obvious from here and um

50
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,239
therefore you see here we have one half

51
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,599
of the summation over i j and you're

52
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,319
supposed to sum over all the I and all

53
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,239
the JS and that will pick

54
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:32,040
um

55
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,239
uh each of these elements uh

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,920
twice uh

57
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,959
so the the one half will go away and so

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:47,760
for example if you have just one

59
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:52,680
pair you will have uh J12 plus

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:56,560
j21 and uh they will uh end up this sum

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,560
will end up being just one term J12 *

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,560
X12

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,480
you also should remember that uh we have

64
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,319
to use the Gibs do relation which

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,959
relates the gradient in pressure to the

66
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,920
gradi in chemical potentials for example

67
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,359
for a pure

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,320
substance so there's only one uh

69
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,280
constituent this also holds and it says

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,240
that the gradient in pressure is equal

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,400
to the concentration of the substance

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,080
times the gradient in the chemical

73
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,759
potential uh at constant temperature of

74
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,280
that substance we will use this today in

75
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
one of the

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,199
examples so here uh I've

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,600
included up

78
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,199
there here there still the full

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,199
expression but now I'm I want to focus

80
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:57,880
only

81
00:04:52,199 --> 00:05:01,400
on on the vectorial uh fluxes and

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:06,160
forces so the fluxes of extensive

83
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:10,039
properties that are U that are of

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,960
vectorial of yeah vectorial character so

85
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,560
we exclude the scalars chemical

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,960
reactions we exclude the tensorial uh

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:24,759
flues so we exclude the citation

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:27,960
function you see here that we have

89
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:31,000
many uh different

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,720
terms and then

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,720
the let's suppose we have

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,720
only three kinds of particles in our

93
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:48,560
system that summation over the i i and

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:53,919
JS uh ends up

95
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:58,360
contributing only uh three of these uh

96
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,360
products of forces and fluxes

97
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,759
only three of them are non zero and

98
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,000
independent so this will be the inter

99
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,000
diffusion of particle one with respect

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,440
to two of particle one with respect to

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,759
three of particle two with respect to

102
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,960
three and then we

103
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:28,639
have um the diffusion of of electrical

104
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,960
charge related to a change in

105
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,520
electrostatic POS potential gradient in

106
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,160
electrostatic

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,080
potential of course heat is in the

108
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,199
gradient of one / T and then there is

109
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,199
also this term with the

110
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:54,360
pressure which gives you uh flux of

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,360
particles um driven by a gradient in the

112
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,520
pressure so we have six

113
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,360
terms six

114
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,759
different uh extensive properties that

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,319
can be transported in our

116
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,120
system and six

117
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:22,560
different degrees of dise equilibrium

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:25,520
which uh uh control and uh Drive the

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,240
system back towards equilibrium this is

120
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,680
also related to the chatelier brown

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
principle and

122
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,639
you

123
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:40,479
remember um the

124
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:44,639
more see each one of these uh degrees of

125
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,000
this equilibrium is related to a

126
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,879
a condition necessary condition for

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,240
Mutual equilibrium so if you have no

128
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,520
gradient in temperature you have a

129
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,680
quality of temperature that so from that

130
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,199
point of view uh uh you have uh you you

131
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,720
are okay for equilibrium but that's not

132
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,720
the only condition you also need no

133
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,680
gradient in pressure that's pressure

134
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,759
equality if the systems can exchange

135
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,039
volume

136
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,120
um this is part of the chemical

137
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,960
potential but it's the electrical

138
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,039
electrostatic so if

139
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,520
you so you have a you're at equilibrium

140
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,120
at least from that point of view from

141
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,039
the electrostatics if you have no

142
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,919
gradient in the electrostatic potential

143
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:34,159
and here also you you have

144
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:38,080
the equality of chemical potentials of

145
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,560
the various pairs if they are all equal

146
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,279
to zero then we are at

147
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:50,279
equilibrium uh the more you have of them

148
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:53,600
that are different from zero the farther

149
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,959
you are from equilibrium the more degree

150
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,079
they add up to the degrees of of

151
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:03,560
equilibrium and therefore like chat

152
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:08,000
Brown says uh you uh your system will

153
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:10,160
have a stronger tendency to uh uh return

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,320
to

155
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,519
equilibrium and the way they uh the

156
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,160
system returns to equilibrium is is uh

157
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,440
described by this big

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,279
Matrix in

159
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,959
fact I didn't put the the tensor signs

160
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,640
but these are each each of them is a

161
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,760
tensor because the most General relation

162
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:38,360
between a vector and another Vector is

163
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,360
through even if linear it's through a

164
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,600
tensor so you see how uh

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Rich the variety of

166
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,519
phenomena uh that we can uh encounter

167
00:09:50,200 --> 00:10:00,079
and that

168
00:09:51,519 --> 00:10:00,079
we we can model uh is so of course

169
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,519
uh if you want to uh include all of them

170
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:12,360
you need the computer uh computer

171
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:18,320
program to to do it this is done in

172
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,760
simulations but um even though uh

173
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,680
nowadays uh we have computers and we

174
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,560
have uh softwares that are

175
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:31,320
very they're able to com to to to to

176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,320
model very complex uh

177
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,399
phenomena in

178
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,519
fluids and not only fluids because of

179
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,200
course I'm talking fluids but also in

180
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,040
solids we have the

181
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,480
same

182
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,760
ideas

183
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,399
um very

184
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,800
seldom they are implemented to include

185
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,680
all these off diagonal

186
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,480
terms most of the times you just uh keep

187
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,480
the diagonal

188
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:11,320
ones for example here I've

189
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,160
already uh sort of shaded out these off

190
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,360
diagonal ones because most of the times

191
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,480
you assume that um uh each

192
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:25,399
pair so the relative Flux Of pair one

193
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:29,300
two is driven by the relative

194
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,800
um uh difference in gradient of

195
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,160
[Music]

196
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,399
the chemical potentials of that

197
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,360
pair and not the other ones but these

198
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,560
are possible cross effects and these

199
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,040
possible cross effects may

200
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,240
result in for

201
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,399
example

202
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,399
uh the possibility

203
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,079
that concentration

204
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:04,120
gradients uh you have two two different

205
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:07,200
different so you you could have a flow

206
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,880
uh upward the concentration gradient of

207
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,760
one constituent driven by the the flow

208
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,720
downward of of two other constituents

209
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,720
and part of it could be captured by

210
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
these

211
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,199
but I think that if you want the most

212
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,279
General description of that you you

213
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:26,360
would need to include also these off

214
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,240
diagonal

215
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,920
terms okay now we have have

216
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,160
uh already done thermoelectric effects

217
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,040
and from this point of view the

218
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,560
thermoelectric

219
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,000
effects

220
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,000
uh cover these degrees of the

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,399
equilibrium so a material in which you

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,720
have gradient in temperature and a

223
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,800
gradient in electrostatic

224
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,040
field and so our system becomes just 2

225
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,040
by two two

226
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,079
quantities extensive quantities

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,519
transported and two degrees of this

228
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,199
equilibrium

229
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,760
and since we are at it uh I think I

230
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:09,079
should uh there was something wrong in

231
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,000
the The View graphs that uh in the slide

232
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:15,160
where I did this calculation last time

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,800
so I corrected it

234
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:23,519
now because I was using the wrong

235
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:27,800
expression for uh the work the work

236
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,680
triple work so here uh I've have taken a

237
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:37,480
slightly different approach to correct

238
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:41,199
that uh first of all I write what the

239
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,639
reversible work is and you remember in

240
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,639
the situation like we have

241
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:55,600
done uh in when we did the heat transfer

242
00:13:51,279 --> 00:14:00,680
so we had here uh this is

243
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:05,120
X here is T and here is T Plus uh

244
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,240
DT and then we put in an

245
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,639
engine that

246
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,639
receives a heat

247
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,480
flux and like a Carno Engine with the

248
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,519
Carno efficiency because it's a

249
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,880
reversible engine

250
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:27,120
produces a W

251
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:33,759
uh let's call it U th for thermal uh

252
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,759
reversible which is given by that

253
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,279
minus Q gradient in t over

254
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:52,240
T now here we also have a a a gradient

255
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:59,000
in the electrostatic

256
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,000
potential so you we can use that by

257
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,240
extracting with an electric motor for

258
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,800
example some uh work also this

259
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:15,600
way and that will

260
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,600
add a an electrical work

261
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:26,360
reversible which is given by uh since uh

262
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,279
the effect that the the gradient in U uh

263
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,959
in the electrostatic potential is is

264
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:37,920
driven by the the um CC

265
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:39,600
effect this is given by minus

266
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,639
I

267
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:47,920
times uh the gradient in

268
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,920
v and that's minus

269
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,480
I

270
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,480
time

271
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,639
Epsilon uh gradient in t

272
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:08,519
or maybe sorry there is no minus

273
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:11,160
here uh I drive a current

274
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:14,240
down from high potential to low

275
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,279
potential and the power of the engine is

276
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,360
uh current per per voltage the power is

277
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,440
a current per voltage and so there's no

278
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:29,079
I here the minus sign comes from the

279
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,079
relation for the uh CC effect

280
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,800
so

281
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,800
that's what I've done

282
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,880
here and next I say

283
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:48,040
well the actual if I put

284
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,959
uh my uh thermoelectric

285
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,319
generator and it does have uh some

286
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,319
entropy produced by

287
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,399
irreversibility and that entropy

288
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,480
produced by irreversibility

289
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,480
is given by the

290
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:10,919
Fier term and the Jewel effect

291
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,880
term of course the actual work of the

292
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,919
generator will be uh less it will be the

293
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,919
reversible minus t *

294
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,000
Sigma and since I was I was there I was

295
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,960
just I just decided to keep also all the

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,280
tensors that I know complicates the

297
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,120
story but uh since I I haven't seen it

298
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,160
done

299
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,919
uh anywhere not that I looked everywhere

300
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:46,960
but uh so I said well why not working it

301
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,590
out and I hope I did the right thing

302
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,799
um so

303
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,240
[Music]

304
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,400
you using that expression and

305
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,240
substituting the

306
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,400
thermoelectric electric relations these

307
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,679
ones you find an expression for

308
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,360
the actual electrical work you can

309
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:11,559
maximize it so you find at which current

310
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,559
density it has the maximum

311
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,480
power so maximum power doesn't mean that

312
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,480
the engine is

313
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,320
reversible uh it's a particular

314
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:30,200
particular point of operation of the

315
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,960
engine and uh or generator

316
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,000
and so if you if you compute this

317
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,400
current if you substitute this

318
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
maximum current density at maximum power

319
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,480
into the expression for the work you get

320
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,880
this expression

321
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,960
here where there begins to appear now I

322
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,480
highlight this parameter

323
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,159
Z which forign an isotropic material

324
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,559
takes this form and it's what is called

325
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,000
the U the

326
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:05,400
the yeah the parameter of Merit the

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,159
figure of Merit for the electro for the

328
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,919
thermoelectric

329
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,480
material and there are some materials

330
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,440
that have have that parameter of the

331
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:23,000
order of one but uh there are also some

332
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Nano structured materials that go well

333
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,280
above one maybe I think even two or even

334
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,960
three um

335
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,200
and this is why the fact that you can

336
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,039
achieve and that

337
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,440
nowadays you

338
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,919
um you are actually uh engineering

339
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,720
materials by

340
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:49,360
layering exactly like we did uh for for

341
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,000
the non-isotropic heat transfer example

342
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,360
here you can cook

343
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,280
up um layers layered materials that have

344
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,559
uh properties alternate properties with

345
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:09,120
high conductivity or or low

346
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:13,600
um I mean um yeah High um uh CC

347
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,960
coefficient and uh low conductivity

348
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,640
thermal

349
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,480
conductivity and uh depending on how you

350
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,960
structure them you may

351
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,240
obtain uh good aspects of this tensor

352
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,120
which of course relates to the

353
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,120
properties uh of how how much it I mean

354
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,039
in the direct if the the directions come

355
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,640
in see see the gradient in temperature

356
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,520
dotted into the tensor means that the

357
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,000
directions are important the relative

358
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,400
direction of your material and uh the

359
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,400
direction in which you put the the

360
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,159
gradient okay then you once you have

361
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,039
this you can also substitute all the

362
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,640
rest in all the rest and compute also

363
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,720
the second low efficiency second low

364
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,240
efficiency is the I

365
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,039
between

366
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,440
the work at maximum power and the

367
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:12,240
reversible work that you could

368
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,919
get with that current that you have at

369
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,919
the maximum

370
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,720
power and this is

371
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,880
the generalized expression for that

372
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,760
efficiency which for the isotropic

373
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,840
material becomes this one the figure of

374
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,960
Merit divided by 1 plus 2 Z and if you

375
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:39,679
if you look at this

376
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:43,200
function uh um I mean z and what is it Z

377
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,919
ided by 1 + 2 Z well it's a function

378
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,640
that of course is zero at

379
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,640
zero uh and then it goes

380
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:57,720
up and

381
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,720
eventually it could reach one

382
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,400
does it reach

383
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,400
one or does it

384
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,120
reach2 uh it's a good question H yeah it

385
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,120
looks one half

386
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
yeah

387
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,919
yeah

388
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,679
okay all right so this fixes that um

389
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:38,000
error that I made a while ago but it's I

390
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:40,240
mean errors are instructive and uh

391
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,760
stimulating so that you try to correct

392
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,120
them so that's

393
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,120
good here is

394
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:54,320
another example somewhat similar to that

395
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,600
one

396
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,960
uh think of having instead of the

397
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,799
electrostatic potential having the

398
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,559
pressure so you have two reservoirs one

399
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:10,679
at T and P and the other at t plus DT

400
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,679
and P plus

401
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,760
DP so here you could uh since you have

402
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,679
suppose this is a

403
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,440
fluid uh well then you could use in

404
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,279
addition to the termal work you you you

405
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,039
in in um you could use the difference in

406
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:33,520
pressure to drive a

407
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,520
flow through a hydraulic

408
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,880
turbine and the work of the hydraulic

409
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,720
turbine is given by the difference in

410
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:53,080
pressure times the volumetric fluide

411
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:56,840
like in a pump no uh so that uh is sort

412
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,159
of uh very analogous to the

413
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,640
thermoelectric effect

414
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:10,919
and so with this pair of degrees of dise

415
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:10,919
equilibrium o sorry here no yeah okay so

416
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,480
um you treat exact you you take those

417
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,200
two elements that survive in the

418
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,159
expression for the entropy

419
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,159
production you assume linear

420
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:32,360
relations and now the flows are Heat and

421
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,120
instead of charge here now you have just

422
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:41,039
particles and if

423
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:45,240
you divide the uh flow of particles by

424
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:48,360
the concentration you get a volumetric

425
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:53,080
fluide so this is cubic meters per

426
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:56,360
second per square meter uh

427
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:00,320
flowing so you can rewrite because

428
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,320
usually what we do is rewrite

429
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:09,919
these Expressions were

430
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,640
uh we have been careful in using the

431
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,279
entropic uh degrees of dise equilibrium

432
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,399
so

433
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:21,559
that that we know that that's where the

434
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:24,480
onager reciprocity applies and so I can

435
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,880
uh safely say that these coefficients

436
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,320
lqp is equal to

437
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:34,279
lpq here Q Q stands for heat and P

438
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,320
stands for pressure of course and so now

439
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:42,080
at this level I can apply on

440
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,440
sagger but then we like to work with

441
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,039
more familiar variables which in this

442
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,559
case are the volumetric flow rate and

443
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,360
the gradient in pressure is already

444
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,039
there and the gradient in temperature

445
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,559
instead of the inverse temperature so we

446
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,520
introduce

447
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:01,279
parameters

448
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,279
like the normal

449
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:11,000
conductivity uh or on the other uh the

450
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:15,360
other diagonal element is usually

451
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,720
written as K Over new where new is the

452
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,039
viscosity the sheer viscosity of your

453
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:25,039
fluid and K is

454
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:28,760
the Dy uh permeability because if you

455
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:36,080
had only these um

456
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:40,120
uh diagonal term here uh this is simply

457
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:43,679
Theo of flow in like in a capillary or

458
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:48,159
in a porous medium driven by the

459
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:52,399
gradient in uh in pressure which is what

460
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:55,440
you would use for example to describe uh

461
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:56,640
the flow in a porous material or a semi

462
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,080
or a permeable

463
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,159
membrane like here

464
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,320
or in a in a capillary tube or in a

465
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:09,760
micro fluidic device or things like

466
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:14,679
that but the off diagonal terms are

467
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:17,720
also there and they give rise to U two

468
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,760
cross phenomena that are related to one

469
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,840
another that sometimes are go under the

470
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,399
name of thermoosmotic effect or

471
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,600
mechanocaloric

472
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:33,880
effect so the thir

473
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,880
osmotic is is this

474
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,399
one uh no I'm sorry Theros motic is this

475
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,720
one you have a flow of

476
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:48,840
material in the

477
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:52,200
absence of uh gradient in in in in

478
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,200
pressure driven by a gradient in

479
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,760
temperature we could

480
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,760
actually have this

481
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:04,279
flow uh go uh if the gradient in

482
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,159
pressure is is small but opposite to

483
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:12,120
what it would what the Dilo would drive

484
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:15,480
the flow you could uh go against that um

485
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,799
pressure gradient by uh using a thermal

486
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,679
gradient appropriate thermal gradient so

487
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:29,039
that is one way in which you could

488
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:34,080
U somehow uh drive your material in uh a

489
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,240
capillary uh or mic microfluidic device

490
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,440
with a gradient in

491
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,840
temperature

492
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:45,240
against Grine pressure and the the

493
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,159
opposite or the

494
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,640
um yeah cross the conjugated the cross

495
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,000
effect is this one where you would

496
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,320
without a gradient in

497
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,279
temperature you could have a gradient in

498
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:04,960
pressure that drives a heat

499
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:07,080
flux but also here you could have uh if

500
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
if depending on the relative diff

501
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,080
differences you could have a gradient in

502
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,360
pressure Drive

503
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,960
Heat against uh up a temperature

504
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,240
gradient so in the opposite direction of

505
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,960
what you would

506
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,960
expect if you just had for you

507
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:40,640
okay so now let's move into the realm of

508
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,640
uh diffusion of

509
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,440
particles the

510
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:50,559
simplest is when we have two uh

511
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,559
constituents like a pair of particles so

512
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,559
we have inter diffusion of one into the

513
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:03,519
other and uh so this is a sort of a

514
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,000
direct uh low

515
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:10,159
case which you which gives rise to fix

516
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,159
law of

517
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,799
diffusion or

518
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:20,600
also since we're talking about a pair uh

519
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,720
it it it is belongs to instead of fi

520
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,720
it's called Stefan Maxwell Stefan um law

521
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,480
of of

522
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,840
diffusion and here is uh the story

523
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,960
actually uh see on the left hand side

524
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,200
here uh it's just repeated all the

525
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,919
various steps that took us

526
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,799
to uh the relation I just said so uh

527
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,760
let's just look at uh what we have here

528
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:51,679
on the right hand side which is the new

529
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,039
aspect so we assume a linear Force flux

530
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,600
law and as we've seen in the previous is

531
00:30:54,039 --> 00:31:00,240
just a direct

532
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,720
effect the of this equilibrium X12

533
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,600
drives the flu the relative

534
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,919
flux J12

535
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:13,799
through a a coefficient that yeah on the

536
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:18,519
previous slide we call it l1212 here

537
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:21,760
just sort of drop the double one

538
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:24,559
two okay you

539
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,919
usually there are a couple of ways of in

540
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:31,080
which this is typically

541
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:35,440
Rewritten so there is no single uh

542
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,440
familiar way of writing of rewriting

543
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,120
this uh we like to rewrite it in terms

544
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,000
of diffusion

545
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,760
coefficients which are the things that

546
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,799
we measure in the

547
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,799
laboratory or we measure

548
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:59,720
also of nowadays with Monte Carlo

549
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,720
molecular dynamic simulations

550
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,480
uh and so we rewrite we call this l12

551
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,960
this way identify so these are the

552
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,440
concentrations of the

553
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,840
two constituents and of course they are

554
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,159
related to one another not because the

555
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,399
mole fraction is of SEC of the second

556
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,600
species is one minus the mole fraction

557
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:28,960
of the other one so uh also between the

558
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,120
concentrations you have a

559
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,559
similar

560
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,559
relation because uh all right and

561
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:46,120
so the other aspect is that you uh

562
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:55,440
somewhere yeah here you yeah here you

563
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,840
you you notice that you can prove that

564
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,639
the

565
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:05,559
X12 can also be written by virtue of the

566
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:09,679
um relation of

567
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:09,679
the Gibs DM

568
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,000
relation uh can be written also in terms

569
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,480
of either just

570
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,200
one uh gradient X1 is just the gradient

571
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,600
in in chemical potential of uh substance

572
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,519
one so it's just is this one like min-1

573
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:36,159
/ ttimes gradient of

574
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:39,200
mu1 and that's uh X1 but you could also

575
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:44,159
Define an X2 and these are all related

576
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,159
to X12 so by substituting and expressing

577
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,639
these uh in terms of the flux of

578
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,799
particles

579
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:58,799
one as proportional to the gradient in

580
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,799
chemical potential of that particle

581
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,000
you can rewrite it this way and then the

582
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:08,520
gradient in chemical potential of

583
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,399
particle one can be related if you do

584
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,800
properly the various derivatives since

585
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,320
the chemical

586
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:21,839
potential uh is a function of the

587
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,839
concentrations so you remember our

588
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,119
uh

589
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,560
usual expression here

590
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:33,320
for uh

591
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:37,200
for example for an ideal uh

592
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,280
mixture uh for an ideal mixture you can

593
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,599
U write this and therefore the gradient

594
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,119
in in the chemical potential done

595
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,280
because here we temperature fixed

596
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,679
temperature and pressure so this doesn't

597
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,879
enter into the gradient and so that so

598
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:58,440
then you get that gradient in mu is

599
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:03,079
RT times uh the

600
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,079
gradient of the logarithm so

601
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,000
that's

602
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:14,839
that's the gradient over over

603
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:18,680
Y and of course since the the con the

604
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,839
the mole fraction are related to the

605
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,880
concentration you can also rewrite it in

606
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,760
terms of

607
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,320
concentration so uh that

608
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,640
is I mean this expression is for the

609
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,760
ideal if you have a more General

610
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:38,079
situation uh you would have to do the

611
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,760
the partial derivative of U with respect

612
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,240
to to to n which is written here and

613
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,240
that's that's what appears

614
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,920
here so if you include all these then

615
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,599
you have a relation between the flux of

616
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,640
particle

617
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,640
one and the con the the con

618
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,640
concentration of particle one times the

619
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,240
gradient in the mole

620
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,200
fraction and then you can call this

621
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:12,440
group The F diffusion

622
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,599
coefficient which you see is related to

623
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,599
the Maxwell St and diff Fusion

624
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:24,599
coefficient and so it all depends

625
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,560
on giving names to these diffusion

626
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:33,359
coefficients the

627
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:38,200
um typically people measure F diffusion

628
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,200
coefficients notice also that you can

629
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,640
uh you can also Define

630
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,040
a self

631
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,119
diffusion uh

632
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,000
case this is done for example

633
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,560
U suppose you have just water in your in

634
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,119
your box

635
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:05,319
and but suppose that some of the oxygens

636
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,920
some of the water molecules some

637
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:13,400
percentage of of water molecules are U

638
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,000
doped well actually they're made with

639
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,119
isotopes of oxygen so instead of using

640
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,200
oxygen 16 you use oxygen 18 so you have

641
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,359
water

642
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:28,280
molecules that have a a an isotope for

643
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,760
the for the for the oxy

644
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,240
oygen that doesn't the isotop doesn't

645
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,480
change the chemical

646
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,960
properties uh but that allows you to uh

647
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,119
with

648
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:47,720
proper uh detection to follow the

649
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,400
diffusion of the sort of a heavy uh it's

650
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,119
not really heavy water because the heavy

651
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,040
water is with the arterium not with the

652
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,520
oxygen 18 but uh that in this case it's

653
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,400
a heavier water than uh than the other

654
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,160
one so you can see the inter diffusion

655
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,800
and and of course this diffusion is

656
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:08,240
related to the brunian motion the random

657
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,560
motion uh generated by collisions and

658
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:16,000
the kinetic energy that the particles

659
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:18,240
always have at finite temperatures so in

660
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,200
that case you

661
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:27,520
measure the self diffusion of uh

662
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:32,079
water uh which is which is a which is an

663
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,079
interesting uh case and subase of this

664
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,040
one now if in addition to having

665
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,040
gradients in concentrations you have

666
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:50,720
also gradient in

667
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:54,920
temperature this opens

668
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,920
up uh to diffusion or Thermo diffusion

669
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,920
effects

670
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,720
and so the transport THM of for Asis

671
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,200
means remember foris means transport so

672
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,160
uh it's

673
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,839
you you

674
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:16,760
generate Flux Of of um

675
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,599
particles with a gradient in temperature

676
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,920
even if you don't

677
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,880
have the driving force of the gradient

678
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,800
of the chemical potential so even if you

679
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:31,440
don't have gradients in concentrations

680
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,440
just the GR in temperature drives

681
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,760
particles so that so that

682
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:53,040
is this is

683
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,000
the written explicitly X12 which is

684
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,319
minus one / T times the gradient mu1

685
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,319
minus mu2

686
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,720
uh we can write it also in terms like

687
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,280
I've said here with the partial

688
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,680
derivative starting from the chemical

689
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,760
potentials you can write it this

690
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,680
way in terms of the

691
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:22,520
concentration uh yeah sorry this should

692
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,520
be a C1 over C1 not I I'll correct that

693
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,119
yeah okay so this is the setup up so

694
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,480
that's the usual formula for the entropy

695
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,599
production from which you infer what are

696
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,280
the entropic degrees of thise

697
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,440
equilibrium which are the ones that

698
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,440
enter in the linear Force flux

699
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,640
relations and

700
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,960
um

701
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,079
so the

702
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:05,440
the force flux relations are are this

703
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,240
you therefore put in Matrix of

704
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,880
coefficients and the Matrix has to be

705
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:13,079
symmetric so we will have that L

706
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,680
q12 is equal to l12

707
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:21,280
q and we rewrite it

708
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:24,599
in so-called familiar variables or the

709
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,359
traditional ways so as to single out the

710
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,560
gradients in concentrations instead of

711
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,599
the gradient in canical

712
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,119
potentials however when you do

713
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,760
that your system of

714
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,040
equation loses the

715
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,839
apparent

716
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,079
symmetry so you see this of diagonal

717
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,880
terms are not uh

718
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,040
identical

719
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,720
H but I have

720
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:59,319
used in order to uh to put this DT here

721
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,319
you see DT is called the thero thermod

722
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:02,319
diffusive

723
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,040
coefficient and

724
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:14,319
uh whereas

725
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,960
D12 is the FI so this is the F diffusion

726
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:22,960
coefficient is the direct effect

727
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,960
between so it's it's you drive a flow

728
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,119
flux of particles a diffusion of

729
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,359
particles by the concentration grade

730
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:35,079
of one of

731
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,079
them and uh whereas this

732
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,480
drives the flow of

733
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,800
particles the flux of particles the

734
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,480
diffusive flux of particles with the

735
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,480
gradient in

736
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,359
temperature and you can enter these

737
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,240
equations in many different

738
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:03,640
ways for example if you you assume uh no

739
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,640
uh gradient in

740
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,640
concentration then you have the heat

741
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:18,280
flux that is simply given by Fier

742
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:20,760
F or if you choose to work at zero

743
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,040
gradient in

744
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,960
temperature the second equation gives

745
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,960
you fix law

746
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,160
you could

747
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,720
also uh consider though that when you

748
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:40,040
work at no gradient in in concentration

749
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,680
you don't have only the first equation

750
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:49,359
you also have the second equation and

751
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,559
that uh gives you a a flux of particles

752
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,559
driven by just the GR in temperature

753
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:59,000
that is the S effect

754
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,880
effect this is the effect

755
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,359
whereby for

756
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,359
example uh you have

757
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,599
U dust particles in the

758
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,240
air that

759
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:19,680
collect uh like I you may have noticed

760
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:24,440
or you probably know uh that uh in your

761
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:29,040
house you often find dust near the cold

762
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,040
walls is S effect

763
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,359
because

764
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:38,800
me from the mechanistic point of

765
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,800
view suppose this is a a dust particle

766
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,599
so it's a large particle with respect to

767
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:49,440
the molecules of air and let's say these

768
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:53,040
are molecules of oxygen nitrogen and so

769
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,920
suppose you have um a gradient in

770
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,920
temperature this

771
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:04,520
way so you get cold

772
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:09,160
here and and hotter there

773
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:13,240
okay so the idea is simply that the

774
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:15,079
particles on this side have a a higher

775
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,680
kinetic

776
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:22,440
energy and when they bounce on the

777
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:25,520
particle of course they uh exchange that

778
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,480
they exert the force on one

779
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,040
side that is

780
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,400
slightly

781
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:36,000
less than the one exerted by the

782
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,240
collisions with the particles that come

783
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,920
from the cold side which are a bit

784
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,440
slower so this

785
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,160
pushes

786
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,160
Your Dust particle towards the

787
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,440
cold

788
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:00,960
uh notice also

789
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:06,079
yeah and the opposite effect the

790
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:11,000
the the conjugate effect is is the duur

791
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,000
effect so when I have a thi

792
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,119
law at no gradient in temperature so I

793
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,599
have a flux of particles driven by

794
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,480
concentration but I also have a heat

795
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:26,480
flux driven by the by the the

796
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,480
concentration

797
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:34,400
okay so it's it's like the the the flux

798
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,880
of of of particles that carries with it

799
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,599
also a heat

800
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,200
flux and that's the duur

801
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,920
effect these effects were were

802
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:52,640
discovered separately then only later

803
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:56,240
they were linked by the onager theory of

804
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:59,680
reciprocity also it's interesting uh to

805
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,280
note this that um for example suppose

806
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:09,200
you have

807
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:13,240
a suppose you you you have no U flux of

808
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,240
particles so you set this equal to

809
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,520
zero okay so if you set that equal to

810
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,880
zero you see that there comes a relation

811
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,760
between a gradient in concentration and

812
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,480
a gradient in temperature so if you

813
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,839
suppose you impose a gradient in

814
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,839
temperature

815
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,280
then and there is no way

816
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:39,599
that

817
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,680
the you don't allow this flux of

818
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,680
particles then the gradient in

819
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,400
temperature builds up a gradient

820
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:50,040
gradient in concentration and that

821
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:53,400
gradient concentration has a play in the

822
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,400
first equation up

823
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,839
here and it um

824
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:05,400
reduces the effective

825
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,720
conductivity so the the conductivity the

826
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,559
the thermal conductivity at no

827
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,640
concentration is higher than the thermal

828
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:17,319
conductivity at

829
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,319
no uh diffusive

830
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,119
flux okay

831
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,200
now that simple picture that I have uh

832
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,800
shown here on the

833
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:43,319
Blackboard

834
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:45,240
is is one uh possibility and it's

835
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:48,640
uh

836
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:52,520
uh one mechanistic possibility that

837
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:55,040
explains the sé effect or the term of

838
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:59,640
orasis so the transport of dust

839
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,640
particles of to towards the cold

840
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,839
side in part that is due to the size of

841
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:09,880
the particles and so it belongs this

842
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,839
this nice article

843
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,599
that

844
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,880
summarizes

845
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:20,760
thermophoretic

846
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:27,079
mechanisms shows that there are many

847
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:30,160
other mechanisms that uh um Drive

848
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:33,040
The Sur effect that control the Sur

849
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:37,880
effect so typically the the heavy

850
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:42,520
particles like to get moved to the cold

851
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:45,000
side uh or the the skew uh particles for

852
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,160
the large particles but then there are

853
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,920
also more

854
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:53,599
sophisticated um actions including

855
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,760
some double layer effects on the surface

856
00:49:53,599 --> 00:50:01,680
of particles that have some charge on on

857
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:03,680
their surface so there is a whole realm

858
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,359
of

859
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,640
uh

860
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:12,839
possibilities uh with which you can use

861
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,520
S effect to drive

862
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:18,799
things uh towards the hot or towards the

863
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,280
cold depending on how you engineer your

864
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:26,040
materials and or how you or the

865
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,040
properties of your materials

866
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:34,920
this is um another paper that shows how

867
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:38,839
you can use um gradient in

868
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:42,480
temperature to move

869
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:46,400
particles against uh friction force in a

870
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,040
small pipe this is the carbon nanot tube

871
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,119
in which you have water

872
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:56,079
molecules and uh and so you manage with

873
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,880
a gradient in temperature to win the

874
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:03,000
friction forces because one of the

875
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:05,680
problems in moving stuff in small pipes

876
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,240
is that you have you would need huge

877
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:12,760
pressure drops if you wanted to do it

878
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:15,680
with a pump and and that will the device

879
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,319
will break because of the high pressures

880
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:24,160
whereas thermophoresis or electroforesis

881
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:27,160
are more effective and uh more more

882
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,160
doable

883
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,680
and this is also in a

884
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,000
thermofluidic device the

885
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,480
idea that the gradient in temperature so

886
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,079
you have

887
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:46,520
a like a hot flow which keeps a hot side

888
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:49,680
and the cold Flo which keeps a cold fly

889
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:52,000
side and then you have your uh actual

890
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,720
device with with particles in it and you

891
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,079
want to separate the particles and

892
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:02,200
that's what what happens by S effect the

893
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,559
let's say the big the particles go to

894
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,839
the cold side and so you reach

895
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,839
separation in your

896
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,839
device now it is also

897
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:28,520
uh important to realize that U what we

898
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,520
have covered here is only

899
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,640
very uh

900
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:37,720
minor aspect of the phenomenologic

901
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,799
phenomenology that goes with diffusing

902
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:44,799
particles and uh so what I'm doing with

903
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:47,880
these slides is I don't pretend I want I

904
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:48,839
can describe what happens but I want

905
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,680
just to

906
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:57,040
suggest that the variety of phenomena

907
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:59,799
that needs to be discussed uh if we have

908
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,319
um let's say another course but also by

909
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:06,920
another teacher because I'm not prepared

910
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:09,760
on this topic

911
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:14,880
uh but maybe the next teacher of this

912
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:18,839
course will be uh and um and so there

913
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:21,520
are for example we talked about the nsen

914
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:26,640
number uh the relative

915
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,119
uh size of the um mean mean free path

916
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,920
relative to

917
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,920
the dimension of your

918
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,880
device so if the nuton number is very

919
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:42,920
small then your

920
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:48,680
particles let's say that uh if they make

921
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:51,640
um at least 100 collisions before uh

922
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:55,920
traveling a distance of the order of

923
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,799
magnitude of your device which the so it

924
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,160
could be the diameter of your

925
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:02,799
pipe then we are safe and we are in the

926
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,680
in the you can make the Continuum

927
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:07,839
assumption that we have made uh in what

928
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,960
we've

929
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:14,960
done but if the nuton number becomes

930
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,960
larger

931
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:21,359
um and you may uh you may reach the

932
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:26,720
Other Extreme which is the

933
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:29,400
ballistic extreme in which a particle

934
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,400
May travel all the way from one side to

935
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,839
the other of your device without even

936
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,640
having a

937
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:40,440
collision so this is not uh dominated by

938
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:43,280
collisions between particles but it's

939
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,839
dominated by collisions between

940
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,839
particles and the walls of your

941
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,480
device plus there are surface

942
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,920
effects and

943
00:54:52,480 --> 00:55:00,319
so uh you see there is a variety of

944
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:03,319
things that uh need to

945
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,319
be

946
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:13,960
considered now thermop

947
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:16,640
foris can also be is

948
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,920
also used as a way

949
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,359
[Music]

950
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:25,680
to uh move particles

951
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:28,319
around this is called self propelling uh

952
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,319
particles

953
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,640
for example here we have

954
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:37,359
a

955
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:44,799
um a PhD thesis and an

956
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:47,319
article that talks

957
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:51,599
about using a phenomenon that we have

958
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:51,599
discussed which is spinodal

959
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,319
decomposition

960
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,559
uh in order to move move around

961
00:55:57,319 --> 00:56:02,559
particles and there are two kinds of

962
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:05,640
particles uh this one which has a double

963
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:09,520
phas it's called Janos particles because

964
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:13,079
Janos is the god with two faces Greek

965
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,720
god with two faces so this is so this

966
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:21,400
particle is goldplated on one side and

967
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:25,319
not on the other side and the gold uh

968
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:27,319
surface layer uh guarantees a since it

969
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:30,920
has a high conduct AC ity guarantees a

970
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:34,599
uniform temperature uh and so then what

971
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:39,440
what what they do is to um shine some

972
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:41,680
laser light to heat up that

973
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,079
particle and that

974
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:48,960
therefore um a temperature

975
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,000
profile uh builds

976
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,480
up

977
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,960
and and then they found they find a a

978
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,440
solution so the particle is in a

979
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:04,520
solution solution which is which

980
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:08,359
is non non missible at high temperatures

981
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:13,079
so we have we have studied spinodal

982
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:16,760
decomposition in in substances that have

983
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:16,760
an upper critical

984
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:24,079
point remember and this is the uh

985
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:27,359
spinodal curve this is the unstable and

986
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,559
this is the metastable region

987
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:32,920
okay so you could do that phenomenon

988
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:34,920
that that thing if you could cool down

989
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:40,319
the particle but it's easier to heat up

990
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:44,480
than cool so they found it easier to U

991
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,319
develop a mixtures that work the other

992
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,520
way

993
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:52,720
around uh from what I remember also

994
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:56,520
water and nicotine uh as a lower bound

995
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,520
as a lower critical point like this uh I

996
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:04,319
don't know exactly what substances they

997
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:07,920
use here water and 2.6 looted in

998
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:10,200
okay whatever that is uh in any case uh

999
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,039
the idea is that you start I mean the

1000
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,280
blue uh mixture which is on the

1001
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,559
surrounding the particle is at this

1002
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,599
point so it's fully

1003
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,920
mixed and

1004
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:27,319
then since you heat up the surface of

1005
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:30,599
the particle in this uh layer say

1006
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:33,400
boundary layer around it the temperature

1007
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,319
goes up and you enter into

1008
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:39,799
the uh

1009
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:41,880
unstable region and the unstable

1010
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:44,880
region uh

1011
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,880
creates

1012
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:56,119
uh the let's say the freeze the free

1013
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:58,680
energy uh and that free energy if

1014
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,920
properly directed can be used to propel

1015
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,920
the

1016
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,240
particles in two ways you need

1017
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,559
asymmetries so for the Ginos particles

1018
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:12,520
the asymmetry is on the fact that uh you

1019
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,240
have more heating on one side on the

1020
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:18,480
other and therefore uh you get you

1021
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,359
generate a concentration gradient from

1022
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,640
this side to the other side and that Mo

1023
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:26,720
that movement of particle in One

1024
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,839
Direction uh

1025
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:32,960
uh propels the the the big particle in

1026
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:35,839
the other direction and so you get the

1027
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:40,680
particle move or

1028
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:43,359
here they have a still a goldplated

1029
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:47,599
particle but all around so it's not

1030
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:50,599
Janos but but it's not uh completely

1031
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,039
it's not completely spherical so non non

1032
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:56,599
sperical particle and the the non

1033
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:59,640
sperical aspect here makes it so so that

1034
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:03,680
the gradient in the concentration and

1035
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:07,559
the gradient in temperature

1036
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:09,760
cross so that Crossing means that the

1037
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,760
these two gradients are not directed in

1038
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,000
the same so there is a

1039
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,520
component of the gradient

1040
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:22,240
in uh in in

1041
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,240
concentration uh that

1042
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:29,359
goes orthogonal to the gradient in

1043
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:32,599
temperature and that will cause the

1044
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:35,440
movement of particles that will push

1045
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:40,000
your

1046
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:43,359
U your big particle

1047
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,960
uh I think

1048
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:48,680
downward okay so you can play also you

1049
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:53,680
can play people are playing because you

1050
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:56,039
see this recent uh this is recent work

1051
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,119
there's a lot that people are doing

1052
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:59,119
using these uh

1053
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,319
methods

1054
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:09,359
or another way

1055
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:11,200
to exploit uh or Deploy on equilibrium

1056
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:15,640
is

1057
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,559
um what they are called molecular

1058
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,119
Motors essentially

1059
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,799
are

1060
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:27,079
Nano particles that develop motion at

1061
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:30,520
the expense of

1062
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:36,400
um chemical

1063
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:41,680
reactions and here for example the the

1064
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:45,720
particle it simply has a Catal a Catal

1065
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:48,359
Catalyst or an enzy enzimatic site which

1066
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:53,279
catalyzes the chemical reaction so it

1067
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:57,359
lowers U the activat the venous

1068
01:01:53,279 --> 01:02:01,359
activation energy only uh locally here

1069
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:04,079
so it promotes chemical reactions uh in

1070
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:06,039
this side of the particles of course the

1071
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,400
chemical reactions change the

1072
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:10,880
composition the change in

1073
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,720
composition creates a gradient in

1074
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:19,119
concentration and that and that's how

1075
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:19,119
you get you get Flux Of of

1076
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,680
particles in

1077
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:27,319
fact we

1078
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:33,520
said that uh the

1079
01:02:27,319 --> 01:02:38,039
um um KU symmetry

1080
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:42,680
principle uh prevents in an isotropic

1081
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:47,640
medium uh two couple chemical reactions

1082
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:51,760
which are scalar uh um transport with

1083
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:57,799
with with with with vectorial transports

1084
01:02:51,760 --> 01:03:01,760
but on the other hand uh the fusion

1085
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:04,880
is sometimes the limiting aspect in

1086
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,200
chemically reacting system because it is

1087
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,960
by diffusion that particles go to the

1088
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:15,480
proper place and then where they used up

1089
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:19,599
for uh reacting with with the other

1090
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:23,760
reactants so indirectly uh the fusion

1091
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:27,279
processes are are very important in in

1092
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:31,160
in controlling chemical uh reactions so

1093
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:34,799
they are effectively not coupled in the

1094
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:39,640
way of the onager kind but but they are

1095
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:43,000
coupled overall in order to feed the

1096
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:47,319
chemic the chemical reactions with the

1097
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,319
reactants where they need to be

1098
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,319
and then if you have uh

1099
01:03:59,279 --> 01:04:06,359
simultaneously a

1100
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:10,799
diffusion uh so many uh constituents and

1101
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:10,799
also the electro static

1102
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:19,359
field the the charges play a role they

1103
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:23,039
may play a role just locally like these

1104
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:26,559
kind of double layers around

1105
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:29,520
particles um that have charges inside

1106
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,520
that can move to the

1107
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:38,160
surface and these effects are things

1108
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:41,060
that happen for example at electrodes in

1109
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:43,400
in in in a fuel cell

1110
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:48,119
[Music]

1111
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,119
or or an electrolytic

1112
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,200
um

1113
01:04:51,480 --> 01:05:01,960
device or simply you have like a

1114
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:01,960
thermoelectric effect coupled to

1115
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,880
diffusion

1116
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:12,000
so this is

1117
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,799
a what you so electrochemical systems

1118
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,680
belong to this kind of class and these

1119
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,599
are the kind of equations that you need

1120
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,559
to

1121
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:26,119
consider if you model an electrochemical

1122
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,039
system with say three different part and

1123
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:33,000
three different particles is very common

1124
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:36,359
because you may have like the solvent

1125
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,119
and you have two solutes but often you

1126
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:41,760
have many more and these solutes could

1127
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,520
be the ions that travel in your

1128
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,520
electrolytic

1129
01:05:45,319 --> 01:05:51,960
solution uh the typical models are done

1130
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:55,000
this way with this inter diffusion uh

1131
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,039
taking up only the diagonal ones and

1132
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,240
often

1133
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:04,400
uh forgetting these other

1134
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:06,119
more complicated or second order maybe U

1135
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,440
cross

1136
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:11,920
effects uh but if you are interested in

1137
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,799
doing Electro chem modeling

1138
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,440

01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:22,520
then these are the references that you

1140
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:26,240
should not uh um

1141
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:27,960
overlook this book

1142
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,720
non equilibrium thermodynamics for

1143
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:37,359
heterogeneous systems by KR and

1144
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:40,039
bed um is an excellent starting

1145
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:42,279
point for doing properly things the way

1146
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:42,279
we've

1147
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:49,599
done and also for realizing that uh so

1148
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:52,760
you can compute distributions in in the

1149
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:55,160
Heat this they call they call they use

1150
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,960
the the the gr and mazour notation so

1151
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,279
what we call called The Q double Prime

1152
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,200
they call measurable heat flux but other

1153
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:03,200
than that

1154
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,200
uh they essentially

1155
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:11,079
use the

1156
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:13,319
same notation that we've

1157
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:15,359
done

1158
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:22,559
uh and

1159
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:26,079
um also a very important aspect here is

1160
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,880
the the interfaces

1161
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,559
at the

1162
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:36,480
electrodes and uh so where you have you

1163
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:39,599
you have sort of um jumps from one

1164
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,599
substance to the

1165
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:49,640
other and uh yes you

1166
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:52,520
could Define um continuous or diffuse

1167
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:56,039
interface theories which is another

1168
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,720
aspects that that need to be covered

1169
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:01,039
uh but

1170
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:03,960
um they do it with sharp

1171
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,559
interfaces which is the Gibbs uh

1172
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,680
traditional

1173
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:11,839
method uh but the reason why I urge you

1174
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:14,720
to go to their work is that they do it

1175
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:18,040
correctly and carefully and in

1176
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:20,839
particular Also regarding this

1177
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:22,880
um role of

1178
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:26,520
interfaces and then on equilibrium

1179
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:31,920
thermodynamics at surfaces there is this

1180
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:35,640
paper by GED by one of them dick bed in

1181
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:39,920
1986 which is really wonderful and uh

1182
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:42,520
you should uh uh study that paper if you

1183
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,520
are in this

1184
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:51,880
business now of course um we are at the

1185
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:55,640
end of the course so not covering

1186
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:59,359
anything more of

1187
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:03,600
but I want to mention that

1188
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:09,839
um there are many other directions in

1189
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,839
which you could go in the field of

1190
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,560
thermodynamics which

1191
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:16,120
is related to the general principles

1192
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:20,400
that we have

1193
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:22,199
developed but perhaps not the detailed

1194
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:26,560
models

1195
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:28,120
so of course the the Queen is

1196
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,239
statistical

1197
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:33,640
mechanics which is behind we've used

1198
01:09:31,239 --> 01:09:35,440
also some of it when we did the single

1199
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,839
particle in the

1200
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:42,120
Box

1201
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:45,640
um but then you have also uh kinetic

1202
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:48,199
theory of to deal with rarified gas

1203
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:51,080
Dynamics if you if your notes and number

1204
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:55,640
is not very

1205
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:58,320
small and in fact

1206
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,440
uh to cover that the phenomenology of

1207
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:05,679
essentially the the entire fluid

1208
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:08,679
mechanics redone at the uh at

1209
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,679
the

1210
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,800
non

1211
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:16,159
nen very small nsen

1212
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,440
number people have redeveloped uh

1213
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:20,920
there's been

1214
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:24,000
a couple of Decades of very active work

1215
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:27,000
on small scale

1216
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,480
hydrodynamics still still

1217
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,480
ongoing then on the side of

1218
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:39,800
um

1219
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,800
um on the side of developing

1220
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:47,679
uh the foundation so even for

1221
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:50,360
Continuum uh we have this uh issue

1222
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:53,360
remember that of the local

1223
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,679
equilibrium where we assume that we are

1224
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,560
at this state but we're actually there

1225
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,719
and so there is this difference in

1226
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:04,360
entropy uh that we are

1227
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:07,120
neglecting if you do local

1228
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:10,800
equilibrium and uh

1229
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:15,239
which is not neglected in these other

1230
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,239
theories like rational extended

1231
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,040
thermodynamics or

1232
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,320
uh other non-e equilibrium

1233
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:28,360
thermodynamics theories and there are

1234
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,800
not only papers but books about these

1235
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:33,960
approaches and you've seen that we by

1236
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:38,560
using this we' we've seen one example

1237
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:43,239
the katano heat transfer equation well

1238
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:47,639
in that same uh idea you can develop and

1239
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:49,480
you should develop also uh all all the

1240
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:51,600
things that we've done even include

1241
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,920
including what we've done

1242
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,239
today so there is a lot to be done also

1243
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,239
in that

1244
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:03,080
Direction there is

1245
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:06,840
also okay then there is quantum aspects

1246
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:08,000
we talked already about that and uh

1247
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:13,360
there is

1248
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,880
also this diffuse interface uh uh

1249
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:21,840
methods that again if you have two

1250
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:25,320
phases you could consider them as sharp

1251
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:30,480
like uh for example liquid and Vapor you

1252
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:32,480
could have uh uh this is the density of

1253
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:36,800
the of the

1254
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,800
vapor and this is the density of the

1255
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,639
liquid let say

1256
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:46,000
yeah you could consider it sharp but if

1257
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:49,840
you enlarge this

1258
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:54,480
region uh it's

1259
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,480
actually something like this

1260
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:11,760
okay and by assuming the fundamental

1261
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:13,840
relation for your States uh for example

1262
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:19,040
by assuming that

1263
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:21,920
s is not just the function of U

1264
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:26,480
um v

1265
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:29,639
n but it's also a function function

1266
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,960
of the gradients in

1267
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:36,679
concentration and actually since you

1268
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:38,560
need scolar it's you can take uh the

1269
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:43,600
square of the

1270
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:46,760
gradient and you put in it in in as a as

1271
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,320
an additional variable which determines

1272
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,120
equilibrium and now we're talking about

1273
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,960
equilibrium because that's a stable

1274
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:57,040
equilibrium state for

1275
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,040
equilibrium that term

1276
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:04,920
which was uh present also in um in the

1277
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,040
paper by vand der

1278
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:11,560
vals and that which actually is a very

1279
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:14,679
nice paper has been trans translated by

1280
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:17,560
rimson later on and I suggest that you

1281
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:21,560
go and see that paper if you are

1282
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:26,000
studying this well this Theory here has

1283
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:29,960
been developed by land it has

1284
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:34,199
this is now become known as can and

1285
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:38,320
helard models or diffuse interface uh

1286
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:44,320
methods with that thing uh you can

1287
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:44,320
predict the exact shape of this curve at

1288
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,800
equilibrium uh and actually there is a

1289
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:56,239
paper very nice paper in the physical

1290
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:59,520
review by an antovski that

1291
01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:03,199
uh I suggest that you read if you are

1292
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:08,560
interested in in that kind of

1293
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:15,080
development all right so plus of course

1294
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:15,080
you have a a list of an infinite list

1295
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:23,800
of other

1296
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,400
approaches from uh statistical to

1297
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:29,440
numerical simulations so the bolman

1298
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:33,320
equation um approximations of the M

1299
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:36,719
bolman equation this is the famous one

1300
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:39,679
which allows you to compute the

1301
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:43,440
hydrodynamic quantities like heat

1302
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:47,080
flux but Al so the fluxes of particles

1303
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:53,120
but also the like momentum and and

1304
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:56,960
diffusive uh as moments of the balsman

1305
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:59,520
distribution uh uh of equilibrium so we

1306
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:03,960
talking about models that can cover

1307
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,960
also non equilibrium and far non

1308
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,520
equilibrium uh another approximation is

1309
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,120
one

1310
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:13,000
which

1311
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:17,280
derives the equivalent of the N talks

1312
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,960
equations but more complicated with more

1313
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:22,920
moments then fer plank

1314
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,239
stochastic

1315
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:29,080
um equations these are equations that

1316
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:32,159
have some

1317
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:35,120
random noise terms in in

1318
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:38,440
it and then you're certainly familiar

1319
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:41,480
with molecular Dynamics Monte Carlo and

1320
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:44,400
various types of molecular

1321
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:46,480
Dynamics various flavors of the

1322
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:50,560
molecular dynamics that have been

1323
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,600
developed over the years to overcome

1324
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,400
some of the

1325
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:59,320
