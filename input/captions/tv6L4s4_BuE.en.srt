1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,879
Uh we're going to continue with the next

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,040
section of our webinar and I'd uh like

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,880
to introduce

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,960
uh two people from an ILP member

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,720
company. SCBX is a leading financial

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,640
services conglomerate in Thailand. So

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,160
our next speaker will be Nut Chu

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,160
Kungfang who is a senior AI researcher

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,320
at SCBX.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:38,879
uh welcome not as well as I'd also like

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,559
to welcome Tutan Cintu Praset who is

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,440
head of R&D at SCBX and they're going to

13
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,399
talk about some uh implementations that

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,440
they've done in collaboration with Dan

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,640
and Matters.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,640
Welcome.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,039
>> Thanks Jim for the introduction. Um so

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,920
as you can see the quantum uh quantum

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,720
thread uh is not just the theoretical

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,600
concern is happening now. Um so today I

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,960
I would like to share uh the work that

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,240
we have been working at SCBX and in

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,080
collaboration with MIT on the topic uh

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,720
collaborative credit scoring with

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,799
postquantum cryptography. So just just

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,439
to give a little bit of the the

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,720
background um uh the credit score uh act

28
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,920
essentially uh the fundamental tools for

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,159
especially bank to evaluate the customer

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,119
credit worthiness. It can calculate

31
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,759
based on uh transaction of transaction

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,159
data or loanly payment. Um and yes it's

33
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,320
not just for the banking business it

34
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:55,759
also for the uh to telco retailer or

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:59,280
many other industry um for the

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,840
the motivation. So our ambition for this

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,240
work is to create uh a better model and

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,479
more inclusive model by leverage AI

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,840
power collaboration

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:18,480
um for multiple sectors to build a uh

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:22,800
accurately um financial um picture. But

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,879
um we run into the problem with first

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,000
the data silo and the privacy

44
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:32,239
regulation. we can we can not naively uh

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,160
put all the data together and then train

46
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,120
the model. And secondly, the coming

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,000
thread form the quantum.

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,480
Uh yeah, so you you all have heard

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
already the

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,840
the the

51
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,160
encryption right now probably not not uh

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,760
soon will can be break by the quantum

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,200
computer.

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,680
So let's me introduce our um four step

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,319
blueprints. The first one is the

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,400
collaborative AI training. So for

57
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,440
for this part uh is is a technology

58
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,360
technique that allow to train the AI

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,239
based on

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,720
multiple institution

61
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,599
to train the model based on their data

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,640
and without shelling the law data.

63
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,400
This is we use um federated learning.

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,040
Secondly, since we want to u provide the

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,040
service for the credit score uh

66
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,319
inference, we also uh use the fully

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,319
homorphic encryption to encrypt the data

68
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:48,640
at the beginning. So even the server or

69
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:53,040
us can cannot see the law data. Second

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,760
uh the third one is uh proform module uh

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,680
persistent because we want to build the

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:04,720
task worthiness into our system. This we

73
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:08,799
utilize the technique uh like uh

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:12,000
uh crystal delium to for the signature

75
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,840
sign digital signature for this part.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,040
And the last one is the leg regulatory

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,919
compliance. As a bank we

78
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,360
uh oftenly operate in high highly

79
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,120
regulated environment. So we provide the

80
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
the the

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,240
auditability

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,199
for the auditor to to to check and

83
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,759
verify our system

84
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,240
to to to give a little bit more concrete

85
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:47,759
on this the this part. Imagine we have a

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:51,840
bank S and telco A uh two party want to

87
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:57,600
corabate in building the corability uh

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,800
credit score. So the data uh has been

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,600
chunk into multiple part or multiple

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:10,000
side x uh x and c and we want to build

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:14,320
the model in this simple linear model y=

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,240
alpha x plus beta c. So we use the

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,560
federated learning to learn the alpha

94
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,680
and beta form different unit and

95
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,160
different silos. And after we we got the

96
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:32,240
the final model alpha beta, we provide

97
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:36,400
the inference engine for whenever the

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,039
uh someone want to uh get a loan, they

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,120
can feed in the data from bank and the

100
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,840
telco uh with the credit score uh

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,759
computation. This part is done by the

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
following homogorphic encryption. And

103
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,400
the third one is the proof of module

104
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,680
persistent. Module persistent we use as

105
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,360
I say uh we use the crystal deltium. And

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,240
the last one audit of parameter in this

107
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,039
part.

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,960
Uh auditor can uh audit the the the

109
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,639
parameter of the model, the output of

110
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,919
the model

111
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,919
if we use it correctly.

112
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:24,880
And yeah so finally um our about

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,160
technology uh our framework is quite

114
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,960
flex flexible we we break it down into

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,680
uh three part the secure computation.

116
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,919
Yeah. So definitely we are right now we

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,600
using a fully homorphic encryption but

118
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,960
we also allow to do something like uh

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:47,600
multi-party computation as well. And the

120
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,800
second is the model in intricity. We we

121
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,759
use the technique based on this standard

122
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,800
crystal deltium. And the last one is

123
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:03,280
compliant auditor. We use CK star.

124
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,400
And yeah, so lastly for the once after

125
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,639
we we implement this, we we can see the

126
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,599
the trade off between the performance

127
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,720
and complexity because u federated

128
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,880
learning allow us to train the the

129
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,960
complex model. Uh but again if using

130
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,680
with the fully homoromorphic encryption

131
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,199
it can be expensive

132
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,440
to run in in in very real time

133
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,080
application.

134
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,280
Yeah, that's

135
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,280
that's it for my

136
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,360
>> Okay. Yeah. Um so um swapping to to um

137
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,680
to Tanun um it's such a pleasure to

138
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,160
actually collaborate with um MIT ILP and

139
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,319
also like conducting research with um D

140
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,240
and Moras. uh our teams are like

141
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,919
achieving the milestone that um we

142
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
wouldn't be able to actually just

143
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,280
conduct it by ourself. Um and thanks for

144
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,879
the introduction for SCB as well. I just

145
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,520
want to flash before we go to the

146
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
implications of this technology that we

147
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,599
achieved together uh with the researcher

148
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,639
from MAT and with our research team. SB

149
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,879
is the very first bank in Thailand. Our

150
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,919
journey is dated back uh 118 year. Um

151
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,199
our vision um actually you can see that

152
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,360
um we want to start it off from like um

153
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,840
you know the local bank um can go to

154
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,599
next slide.

155
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,039
Uh we wanted to start from local bank to

156
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,519
regional. We want to increase our

157
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,440
customers and instead of being just a

158
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,279
subsidiary right we want to become um uh

159
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
intermediaries. We want to become like

160
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,000
you know the the the fintech group

161
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,920
company which can provide uh extensive

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
platform for like our customers to

163
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,320
access and using all of our financial

164
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,320
solutions and services and also from the

165
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,800
bank to become a fintech company and

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,440
absolutely for the post cryptography and

167
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,360
also for the AIdriven especially for the

168
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,320
collaborative credit scoring it's our

169
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,720
low hanging fruit that we want to tackle

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,240
um first um you know with with with the

171
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,240
method that uh not just like present

172
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,080
Go to the next slide. Okay, you can see

173
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,720
that like you know it's pretty obvious

174
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,640
that um why would we want to attack or

175
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,440
like you know trying to tackle this

176
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,080
angle first. It's the key business for

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,200
our bank. We have um currently breaking

178
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,560
down into like 12 subsidiaries. We want

179
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
our bank to be a better bank.

180
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,839
Traditional bank digitalized you know

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
all the business in terms of like

182
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,600
lending auto lending uh personal loan

183
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,600
and also like micro nano lendings will

184
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,680
benefit from this um technology is that

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,680
we utilize both of the data sharing by

186
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,040
we preserving the privacy of our own

187
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,200
customers right and also trying to

188
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,560
defend ourself against the arrival of

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,320
quantum computer. This is this can also

190
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
be like a stepping stone for us to

191
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,959
actually moving forward right from like

192
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,959
just using

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,959
technologies federated learning sharing

194
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,600
a more solid foundation from for our

195
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,120
data um infrastructure and also for the

196
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,800
IT solutions and you can see that um why

197
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,040
is this like you know our strategic

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,920
imperative right we want to do this

199
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,360
research um this uh paper to be very

200
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,399
competitive

201
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,880
right in our market not just like you

202
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,120
know our regional or within our in

203
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,079
Thailand we can partner if you were to

204
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,920
imagine like for our global partners who

205
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,320
are actually already do the re

206
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,480
encryption of the uh of of their data

207
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,920
with PQC we want to be part of that

208
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,920
ecosystem and you want to be the first

209
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,120
mover who can actually catch the train

210
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,040
and moving together with the

211
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,279
organizations right and also um for uh

212
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,480
the assessment of the the risk

213
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,480
management as well We want to be

214
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,880
proactive because we fully aware of

215
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,120
that. We cannot just like learning and

216
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
being aware, right? We need to actually

217
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,839
start taking actions because preparing

218
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,240
for PQC would take years and years to

219
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,720
actually be ready, right? And and and I

220
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,160
think the arrival uh my personal belief

221
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
the arrival of quantum computing

222
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,360
wouldn't take like you know 10 years or

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
like tens of years. It should be like

224
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
within reach, right? So we should be

225
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,079
able to be ready for that and

226
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,480
essentially it's a core business for our

227
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,200
financial company right bank is built on

228
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,120
trust. We want to add the technology to

229
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,680
ensure that like you know our customer

230
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,079
can trust our bank that we can do um you

231
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,120
know you fully utilize the data for

232
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,279
their own benefits as well and also it's

233
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,720
will be safe against our quantum attack

234
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,959
right so uh my last um key takeaway is

235
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,279
like uh the question for the PQC you

236
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,519
know for all the organizations including

237
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,079
like you know in Thailand it's not like

238
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,200
if we will face this challenge right but

239
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,120
it it is like how well you or we can

240
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,640
actually prepare for it. Right. So I

241
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,760
think now is the time to actually really

242
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,440
architect the future of secure finance.

243
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,519
So that's that's all from me. Yeah.

244
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,360
Thank you.

245
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,680
>> Great. Uh thank you Tutana and Nut. Uh

246
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,480
wonderful presentation. I I just have

247
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,839
one quick question before we move on and

248
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,560
uh it it's pretty impressive that you

249
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,760
were able to do this collaboration with

250
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,160
uh Dan and Matters and uh I know at the

251
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,839
beginning it it it may have been a a

252
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,920
different focus than what it turned out

253
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,800
to be. H how did you find that

254
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,880
experience of collaborating with MIT and

255
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
do you have any pointers for other

256
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,800
companies that might embark on the same

257
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,839
effort?

258
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,600
Yeah, I I I think first you you you

259
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
first set the aspiration, right? that

260
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,800
like like what would your company would

261
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,560
look like and then uh aim for like for

262
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,480
instance for us uh we we we want to

263
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,959
become like uh the the financial

264
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,120
technology group in the region and then

265
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,839
we know that this technology AI and

266
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,320
quantum are up and coming right the

267
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
challenge happens when we trying to we

268
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,440
don't have a lot of expertise in quantum

269
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,040
that's for sure right we are like

270
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
financial group we're good at like you

271
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,440
know building credit score AI is good as

272
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,279
well but um our employees are like we

273
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,839
we're trying to reach on identifying the

274
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,040
experts in the field right once we have

275
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,519
that right for through like MIT ILP and

276
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,160
then we we sort of has access to to Dan

277
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,560
and Mas and then we start framing the

278
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
business statement so that's the key

279
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,639
critical part I think that's that's the

280
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,000
the most challenge for us like it's not

281
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,399
the time it's not the bandwidth but it's

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
like trying to frame the low hanging

283
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,120
fruit identifying um you know what are

284
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,120
the problems that can be tackled by

285
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,040
quantum like PQC or like quantum

286
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,639
computing right or essentially like you

287
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,800
know with with the AI as well. So we

288
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,560
want to try to essentially utilize like

289
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,959
fully utilize the technology right now.

290
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
So so so that's um that's my answer.

291
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,959
Yeah.

292
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,959
>> Great. Uh thank you for those insights.
