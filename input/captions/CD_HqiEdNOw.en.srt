1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,960
so today we are going to move on to a

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,279
new topic once again to remind you where

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,320
of of the path of how we got here in

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,439
within producer Theory we said that it's

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,960
harder than consumer Theory because you

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
don't only do the standard optimization

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,359
the consumer Theory but you need a third

8
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,360
condition you need a market structure

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,120
condition to pin down the equilibrium

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,360
for the last few lectures we relied on a

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,680
particular Market structure which was

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,360
perfect competition that allowed us to

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,760
show that a perfect competition price

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,399
equals marginal cost and that allowed us

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,840
to solve the system for how firms choose

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,960
their quantity and prices in perfect

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,399
competition but as we discussed that's

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,440
an incredibly extreme assumption and

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,640
pretty much unrealistic for almost any

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,199
Market there are some markets that more

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,480
competitive than others but there's

22
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,800
really no such thing as a perfectly

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,760
competitive market so what we're going

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,280
to do now is move on in the next few

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,880
lectures and talk about Alternative

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,560
Market structures and how they change

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
the conclusions we draw this is going to

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,880
be important for two reasons first of

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,799
all it's going to be important because

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,759
it's more

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,079
realistic second of all is going be

32
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,560
important because having established the

33
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,400
first fundamental theorem of welfare

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,280
economics which is the perfectly

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,479
competitive outcome is the best outcome

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,680
we're not going to talk you about why

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,960
that doesn't work in reality and why in

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,040
fact governments aren't just agents of

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,479
chaos but can actually do good things in

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
improving potential market failures so

41
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,600
by introducing these Alternative Market

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,280
structures will also juuce the concept

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,159
of a market failure which is markets not

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,280
working to deliver the efficient

45
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,479
outcome so we're going to start today by

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,680
talking about

47
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,159
Monopoly so we're going to go from one

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,479
extreme to another the one extreme we

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
started with was a perfectly competitive

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
market with a large number firms

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,799
competing to deliver identical products

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,079
we're going to move all the way to the

53
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,280
Other Extreme which is Monopoly which is

54
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,720
not the game but rather the name for a

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,920
market with one

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,959
firm that delivers all that delivers the

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,480
goods for the entire Market s from uh

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,239
many firms competing to one firm

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,440
dominating the market and the key thing

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,599
about Monopoly the key thing that's

61
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,080
going to change is that firms are going

62
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,920
to be price makers not just price acers

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,879
remember in perfect competition the

64
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,640
price was just sort of given to you from

65
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
God it came from some market equilibrium

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,800
you don't know where it came from you

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,800
just knows the price and you couldn't

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,440
affect it well that's kind of silly

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,599
firms can obviously choose the prices

70
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,920
they set so now we move to Monopoly

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,200
we'll actually let firms be price price

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,000
makers as well as price

73
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,319
takers okay now in fact once again

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,280
Monopoly is very extreme it's not

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,480
extreme perfect competition monopolies

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,319
do exist even if perfectly competitive

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,120
markets don't but but it's still a

78
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,560
relatively small share of reality after

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
a couple lectures of Monopoly we'll then

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,840
turn to the more realistic case in my

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,560
favorite word in economics

82
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,159
oligopoly which is the case of several

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,000
firms competing where this competition

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,400
but it's less than perfect competition

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
and we'll come back to that but for the

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,920
next two lectures we're going to move to

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,120
the Other Extreme which is Monopoly okay

88
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,159
and we're talk today about how

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,120
monopolists maximize profits how to

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,760
monopolis maximize

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,640
profits okay well to do that we're going

92
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,239
to turn to a

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,439
concept that we've already talked about

94
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,799
but it's been sort of meaningless so far

95
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,799
which is the concept of marginal

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,000
revenue the marginal revenue is the

97
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,959
revenue you earn on the next unit you

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,439
sell which in perfect competition wasn't

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,280
interesting it was just the

100
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,640
price but it's going to get more

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,360
interesting

102
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,319
today okay so we're going to talk about

103
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,760
what happen so let's go back

104
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,120
and think about a perfectly competitive

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,959
firm and think about what their marginal

106
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,040
revenues so in figure

107
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,519
111 you have a perfectly competitive

108
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,720
firm they The Firm M faces a perfectly

109
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,879
elastic demand curve a perfectly

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,680
competitive firm this doesn't mean the

111
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,160
market demand's elastic but each firm in

112
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,560
perfect competition faces a perfectly

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,040
elastic demand curve so if they sell

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,720
little Q units they make Revenue

115
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,560
a if they sell Q plus1 units they make

116
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,440
Revenue a plus b they add B well we know

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,160
what B is the width is one and the

118
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,479
height is the price so the marginal

119
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,639
revenue from selling the Q plus plus one

120
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,000
unit plus one

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,320
unit is the price okay it's just an

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,800
illustration what we learned before

123
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,039
Monopoly is going to be different and in

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,880
particular monopo is going to be

125
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,160
different because we're going to make a

126
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,840
critical

127
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,440
assumption for how monopolis behave we

128
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,800
are going to assume

129
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,120
that

130
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,280
monopolis that um we're assume that

131
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,280
monopolis uh cannot price

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,440
discriminate that is when a monopolis

133
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,919
sets a

134
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,160
price they set that price for All units

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,520
they sell so monopolis sets the price

136
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,720
they're price maker but it's not quite

137
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,960
free Price setting because we're not

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,120
going to let them set a different price

139
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,479
to me and you when they set price they

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,000
set the price for everyone so we're

141
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
going to assume no price discrimination

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
we'll come back to that but for now

143
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,800
we're going to say that when I'm we're

144
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,400
going to let the monopolis set his price

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,639
but critically it's one price for

146
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,720
everyone and you'll see in a minute why

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,960
this is

148
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,960
important okay so to understand that

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,080
let's go to figure

150
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,840
112 112 is for Monopoly Market all

151
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,720
that's changed

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,919
here is that now firm demand is market

153
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,680
demand

154
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,039
okay with perfect competition firm

155
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,919
demand was perfectly elastic because

156
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,280
there are many firms but now firm

157
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,800
demand's market demand and unless the

158
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,560
market itself features perfectly elastic

159
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,759
demand The Firm will now face a downward

160
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,479
sloping demand curve so now little Q is

161
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,440
Big Q you notice on the x- axis I moved

162
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,080
to Big Q which we used to refer to the

163
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,120
market well with Monopoly markets little

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,880
Q is Big Q there's one firm so the firm

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,759
is the market and that firm faces a

166
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,639
downward sloping demand curve so let's

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,000
say that firm initially wants to sell Q

168
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,840
q1 I'm sorry want sell Q if it wants to

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,440
sell

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Q it has to respect demand so if it

171
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,960
wants to sell Q it's going to set the

172
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,400
price at

173
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,800
P1 a price of P1 allows them to sell Q

174
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,560
units remember they get set the price

175
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,720
now so price of P1 allows to sell Q

176
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,639
units now imagine they want to sell one

177
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,759
more

178
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:02,560
unit what happens well two things happen

179
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,000
okay and in particular if they want to

180
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,879
sell one more

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,599
unit okay they have to lower the

182
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,400
price why because demand is downward

183
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,280
sloping and there's just one price so if

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,199
the monopolis wants to move from selling

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,720
Q to selling q+ one it has to lower the

186
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,479
price from P1 to P2 there's no choice it

187
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,520
has to be on the demand

188
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:31,080
curve so when the anopolis wants to

189
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,879
sell two more two

190
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,240
units okay the marginal revenue they get

191
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,360
want sell one more unit they get the

192
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,400
amount

193
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,800
B which they sell one more unit at the

194
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,919
price P2 but they lose the amount

195
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,280
C they get the amount B but they lose

196
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,639
the amount C or in other words what do

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,280
they what does a monopolis get from

198
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,120
selling one more unit monopis say sells

199
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,400
one more unit the monopolis gets P2

200
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,960
minus P1

201
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:15,400
times um I'm sorry P2

202
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,400
minus P2 minus P1 minus P2 *

203
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,599
q1 okay the monopolist gets some money

204
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,639
from selling additional unit but loses

205
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,319
some money because it had to lower the

206
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,800
price on all its previous units you

207
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,000
might say that once again stop and think

208
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,759
for me for a second it doesn't make

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,240
sense why does it have to well it has to

210
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,919
because it can only set one

211
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,000
price so if it wants to set sell more

212
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,039
it's got to set a lower price which

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,279
means it's going to make less than all

214
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,560
its previous

215
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,800
units okay so basically when the

216
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,720
monopolis sets the price there's now a

217
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,959
tradeoff the tradeoff is if he wants to

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,240
sell more he has to lower the price but

219
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,880
in doing so the monopolis makes less

220
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,959
money on the previous units they

221
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,160
sold okay and that's because they set

222
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
the same price price for All consumers

223
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,200
this is the key intuition that drives

224
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,480
our analysis of

225
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,480
Monopoly okay I like to refer to

226
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,800
this as what I call the poisoning

227
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,160
effect I call it the poisoning effect

228
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,880
it's just the term I like to use because

229
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,680
the idea is if I want to sell one more

230
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,399
unit I have to poison all my previous

231
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,440
sales by lowering their

232
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,680
price because I can't sell another unit

233
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,519
without a lower price and if I lower

234
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,760
price I make less money on my previous

235
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,959
sales okay don't think it's a changing

236
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,920
your price day by day think of this I

237
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,920
have to set one price

238
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,040
yeah yes this is the marginal this is

239
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,040
the marginal

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,399
revenue yeah P P1 minus P2 * q1 it's in

241
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,720
parenthesis okay so basically the

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,760
marginal revenue is if I if I want to

243
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,519
sell one more unit I get P2 for that

244
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,279
unit that's what I get for that unit but

245
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,640
I give up what I was making on all the

246
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,240
old units the difference in the price

247
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,680
that I was making on all the old

248
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,480
units okay and that is basically the

249
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,079
definition of marginal revenue in the

250
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,279
monopolis case so in other words more

251
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:23,800
generally if you write Revenue as P * Q

252
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:27,959
then marginal revenue you can write if

253
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,839
you write P * Q the marginal revenue is

254
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,120
uh Dr DQ okay if you take margin with

255
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,720
respect to Q is

256
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,839
Dr

257
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:44,880
DQ well that equals P plus

258
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:49,040
d p DQ time

259
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,720
Q so when you want to sell one more unit

260
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,519
if I the marginal revenue there's a

261
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,720
positive term which I sell one more unit

262
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,880
but there's a negative term which is I

263
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,279
had to lower my price to sell that

264
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,839
unit so when I'm setting my price I have

265
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,440
to trade these things

266
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,560
off okay I have to trade these things

267
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,800
off which is basically that I have to

268
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,600
trade off the fact that I'm make I'm

269
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,279
going to sell more units but I'm going

270
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,519
to make um make less money to each unit

271
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,040
Why didn't the competitive firm face

272
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,519
this

273
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,120
tradeoff why why was this trade-off not

274
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,680
an issue for the competitive firm

275
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,560
mathematically what's different from the

276
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,560
competitive

277
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,880
firm yeah

278
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,120
dpq is zero for the competitive firm

279
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,000
because it's a price taker it can sell

280
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,360
as much as it wants at the market

281
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,959
price so for the competitive firm March

282
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,560
revenue is just

283
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:48,120
price but for the monopis that's not

284
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,560
true by to sell more it has to lower the

285
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,720
price okay so we can graph a monopolis

286
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,000
marginal revenue curve and we'll do that

287
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,160
in figure 113 so let's go through the

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,959
math here let's do an

289
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,760
example imagine we have an example where

290
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,519
demand is described by the equation Q =

291
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,959
24 minus P just a standard well- behaved

292
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,480
demand equation you know how to derive

293
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,600
that from utility okay imagine that's

294
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,279
the demand

295
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,040
equation well the first step to solve a

296
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,040
monopoly problem is let's rewrite this

297
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,959
as P equal 24 minus Q makes the math a

298
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,240
little

299
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:29,399
easier and now let's multiply both sides

300
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:35,880
by Q to make it a revenue equation so

301
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:38,560
Revenue which is p * Q = 24 Q - Q ^2

302
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,720
that's the revenue that the firm earns

303
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,279
it's p which comes from demand times the

304
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,920
amount of units sold differentiating

305
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,920
this marginal revenue is 24 minus 2

306
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,720
Q that's the marginal revenue curve for

307
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,279
that firm and you can see this in figure

308
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,880
113 here we graph the demain curve

309
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,959
that's the Blue Line the demand curve is

310
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,399
just a standard demand curve where you

311
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,959
can have 24 units per day at a price of

312
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,480
zero and you want zero units per day at

313
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:16,040
a price of

314
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,639
24 okay and then the the marginal

315
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,199
revenue curve is everywhere below the

316
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
demand curve it has the same

317
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,959
intersection on the y- axis but it's

318
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,199
everywhere below the demand curve is the

319
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,600
marginal revenue curve now um the fact

320
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,279
that the margin Ry curve starts at the

321
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,399
same Y intercept is not General it's

322
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,040
only because this is linear in a

323
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,920
nonlinear case the margin Ry curve can

324
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,240
start at a different Y intercept but the

325
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,839
fact that margin revenue is everywhere

326
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,880
below demand is

327
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,720
General margin revenue is always below

328
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,680
demand okay because of this poisoning

329
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,480
effect Marg revenue is always below uh

330
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,120
demand okay questions about that this is

331
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,639
not a simple intuition so questions

332
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
about how this works

333
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,560
okay well arm with that let's talk about

334
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,440
how monopolis maximize profits let's go

335
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:10,199
to figure 114 figure

336
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,880
114 I'm going to now add a cost function

337
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,399
let me say that

338
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,079
C equals I'm just going to assume C

339
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,639
equals 12 plus

340
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,680
q^2 I'm just making just once again you

341
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,079
know how to derive that if I gave you

342
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,800
production function input prices you

343
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,120
could derive that okay but I'm just

344
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,720
going to assume Cal 12+ q^2 so in that

345
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,680
case

346
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,240
what do we know we can draft we can

347
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,680
graph the marginal cost marginal cost is

348
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:43,000
just 2 Q right that's the marginal cost

349
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,920
line in figure 114 marginal cost is 2 Q

350
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,800
we can graph average total cost average

351
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,440
variable cost and average fixed cost

352
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,440
those are all things we learned to graph

353
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,720
before we can put those all in the

354
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,160
graph okay now we can solve for the

355
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,040
Monopoly profit maximizing decision

356
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,759
remember profit maximization always

357
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,120
happens regardless of Market

358
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,839
structure profit maximization happens

359
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,920
when marginal revenue equals marginal

360
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:14,240
cost right remember just to remind you

361
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,360
profits equals Revenue Minus cost so to

362
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,600
maximize this we say marginal revenue uh

363
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,959
minus marginal cost equals zero that's

364
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,399
how we maximize profits right so if

365
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,079
profits is revenue Minus cost and

366
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,240
profits are maximized or marginal rumiz

367
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,519
marginal cost equals zero so the profit

368
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,839
maximizing condition is marginal revenue

369
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,920
equals marginal

370
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,880
cost okay that's true with any Market

371
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,639
structure margin re that's always profit

372
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:44,079
maximizing well what's marginal marginal

373
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:48,000
revenue here is 24 minus 2

374
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,440
Q marginal cost is 2 Q oh I should have

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,800
made this a big Q well it doesn't matter

376
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,839
right because little Q is Big q but to

377
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,600
make life easier let's make that a big

378
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:00,199
Q so what this says is that

379
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,360
qar equal

380
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,120
six that the optimal Monopoly quantity

381
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,279
is

382
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,800
six and how did I do this once again not

383
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,240
too hard from the perspective of your

384
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,600
aome math skills I simply took the

385
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,600
demand curve created a revenue

386
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,000
equation differentiated that to get

387
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,240
marginal revenue have a cost equation

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,399
differentiate that to get marginal cost

389
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,040
set them equal and you get

390
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:34,480
qar that's all you got to do

391
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:38,120
okay now what is the

392
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,880
price I solve for Q but it's not obvious

393
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,880
here how you get back how do you get

394
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,920
price so what's what's what's what price

395
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,160
does the monopolis set

396
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,160
yeah why

397
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,519
18 exactly so you skip the usual thing

398
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,319
where someone gives the wrong answer

399
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,720
okay people often say well look Mar cost

400
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,039
equals marginal revenue the quantity six

401
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,199
and the price is

402
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,160
12 that's the typical answer you say

403
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,520
well look if marginal cost equals

404
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,559
marginal revenue it's six then you go

405
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,880
over to the y- axis and it's 12 and why

406
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,000
is that wrong that's wrong because the

407
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,000
monopolis still has to respect the

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,799
demand curve anopolis cannot charge a

409
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,959
price that people aren't willing to

410
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:26,559
pay okay at a price of 12 that on on the

411
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,160
demand curve people want way more at a

412
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,679
price of 12 to be on the demand could to

413
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,720
get to price we go back to the demand

414
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,840
equation Q = 20 P = 24 minus Q well I

415
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,520
just solved for qar so P

416
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,120
staral 24 minus

417
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,360
qar equals

418
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,080
18 and this is where people get screwed

419
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,400
up in the math here okay remember the

420
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,520
monopolis has to respect the demand

421
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,320
curve they're a price taker price maker

422
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,720
I'm sorry but a price maker within the

423
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,440
constraints the market gives them and

424
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,640
the constraint the market gives them is

425
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,840
the demain

426
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,799
curve so basic so the the the um profit

427
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,799
maximizing point is a price of 18 and

428
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,080
selling six units and you could see at

429
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,720
that point what are their profits well

430
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,480
the profits are price minus average cost

431
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,240
well at six units average cost is

432
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:27,559
eight so they are making 10 per

433
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,679
unit times six units is 60 and that's

434
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,640
their profits

435
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,039
now you might say

436
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,520
gee consumers are willing to buy a lot

437
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,400
more units think about think about the

438
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,600
seventh

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,200
unit say the seventh unit well this is

440
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,640
what's weird to me if you look at the

441
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,080
seventh unit demand is above

442
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:53,240
cost consumer's willingness to

443
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:56,240
pay at the seventh unit is seven I'm

444
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,919
sorry 17 right if you had a price if you

445
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,520
had a price of seven

446
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,000
uh I'm sorry if you want to sell seven

447
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,320
units consumer willing to pay

448
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,880
17 and what's the marginal cost at seven

449
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,640
units well it's

450
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,320
14 so this is weird marginal revenue I'm

451
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,960
sorry

452
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,760
price exceeds marginal cost so why don't

453
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,159
they produce that seventh unit because

454
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,880
of the poisoning

455
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,919
effect to produce that seventh unit

456
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,240
they'd have to lower the price to 17 to

457
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,280
sell it not to to produce it to sell it

458
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,320
lower price 17 they lower price 17 they

459
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,400
make less money on the first six

460
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,159
units indeed what are their profits if

461
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,280
they sell seven well if they sell seven

462
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,240
units what are their profits well they

463
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,600
sell seven units profits equal seven

464
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,000
units at a price of 17 minus costs what

465
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,799
are their costs if they're producing

466
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,880
seventh units well it's 12 + 7 squared

467
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:03,600
so it's 12 + 7 squared uh so that's uh

468
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,600
12 +

469
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,280
49 and if you do the math you get

470
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,280
profits are

471
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,799
58 they get lower profits selling seven

472
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,440
units this is crazy think about this we

473
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:22,240
have units where people are willing to

474
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,640
pay more than it costs to produce and

475
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,039
yet to sell them monopolis will actually

476
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,120
lower their

477
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,760
profits That's The Power of this

478
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,400
poisoning effect effect the reason lower

479
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,840
their profits because they they can make

480
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,840
more money by selling less at a higher

481
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,840
price

482
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,520
yeah what I said they can't do that I

483
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,080
just ruled that out we're going to come

484
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,280
back to that but that's the key is don't

485
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,679
the way I describe it is the way you

486
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,760
think of the decision- making don't

487
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,440
think of them saying I'm gon to set this

488
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,159
for this just think I want to sell X

489
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,280
units what do I have to charge so

490
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,480
they're sitting back saying how many

491
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,280
units should I produce well if I produce

492
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,320
six I can sell for 18 I make 60 if I

493
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,039
produce seven I sell for 17 I make 58

494
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm going to produce six that's the way

495
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:13,320
they think about it okay so that is the

496
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,640
power here now what does this

497
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,320
mean this means that monopolists because

498
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,880
they can set price have something we

499
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,880
call Market

500
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,240
power monopolists have Market power what

501
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:35,559
do I mean by

502
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:39,559
that market power means that basically

503
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:44,559
monopolists can make money even in the

504
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:47,559
long run to see this let's think about

505
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,840
um the marginal revenue expression so

506
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,679
marginal

507
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,480
revenue okay marginal

508
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:59,960
revenue equals

509
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:02,600
p+ DP DQ * Q

510
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,480
now take that

511
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,640
equation and multip and take the uh

512
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,039
second term and multiply and divide by

513
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,120
price so I want to take the second term

514
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,000
I want to rewrite as P

515
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,279
plus

516
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,200
DP

517
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:24,600
DQ time Q over P * p i just multiply and

518
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,840
divide it by

519
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,799
price it's all I

520
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:34,360
did can anyone tell

521
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:36,320
me what this term looks

522
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,880
like

523
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,200
yeah the elasticity of demand but

524
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,480
inverted this is the inverse of price

525
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,200
elicity demand so I can rewrite marginal

526
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,799
revenue I can rewrite marginal

527
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,760
revenue as P * 1 + one over the

528
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,760
elasticity of

529
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,440
demand okay all I did no trick here I

530
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,120
just well there's a little math trick

531
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,640
rote margin Revenue multiply and divide

532
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,919
the second term by P kept the first

533
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,880
term then realize this is the inverse

534
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,440
the elasticity of demand so I can write

535
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,080
margin Revenue as P * 1 plus the inverse

536
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,080
the elasticity of

537
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,960
demand okay why is this

538
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:26,559
important because what this says is the

539
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:29,840
amount the ability of monopolis to make

540
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,520
money depends on how elastic is the

541
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,400
demand they

542
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,279
face okay so what would happen here if

543
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,240
the elasticity demand was negative

544
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,240
Infinity what would marginal revenue

545
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,320
be if the is negative Infinity what

546
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,919
marginal revenue

547
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,440
be come on you guys your MIT students

548
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,600
don't be shy raise your

549
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,080
hand yeah P what does that sound like

550
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
margin REM equals P we've heard that

551
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,919
before that's the perfectly competitive

552
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,559
case well perfectly competitive case

553
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,840
firms face perfectly elastic demand so

554
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,400
if demand in the market was perfectly

555
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,799
elastic monopolis would behave just like

556
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,840
perfectly competitive

557
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:16,039
firms okay on the other hand as the

558
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,240
elasticity Falls or Rises or Falls at

559
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,400
absolute value but rises from Nega 50

560
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,279
towards zero monopolists start to be

561
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,399
able to charge more than monopolis start

562
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,720
tab marginal revenue above the

563
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:31,600
price okay monopolis start tab marginal

564
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,960
revenue above the price okay so we can

565
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,840
rewrite this let's rewrite the condition

566
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,480
for profit maximization profit

567
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:44,520
maximization is that marginal revenue

568
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,679
which equals P * 1 + 1 over the Allis

569
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,720
demand equals marginal

570
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,640
cost okay that's our profit maximizing

571
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,919
condition okay so in other words we can

572
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,240
write that marginal cost over price

573
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,120
equals

574
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,520
1 + 1

575
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,880
Epsilon marginal cost over price equals

576
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,279
1 plus uh 1 plus 1 over Epsilon now

577
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,200
let's define something I'm going to call

578
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,360
the

579
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,919
markup the markup is how much more

580
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,039
monopolis can charge in perfectly

581
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:22,200
competitive firms I'm going to find the

582
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:24,640
markup as P minus MC over P that's what

583
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,679
we call the

584
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,320
markup that is how much more can

585
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:34,159
monopolis charge than competitive firms

586
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,679
it's the markup well the answer is equal

587
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,840
to if we do the math the answer is equal

588
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:44,360
to minus one over the elasticity of

589
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,360
demand if you do the math the markup is

590
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,120
minus one over thees demand in other

591
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:53,320
words the profits monopolis can make are

592
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,039
inversely proportional to the elasticity

593
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,760
of

594
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,200
demand why does that make

595
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,919
sense why does it makes sense that the

596
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,520
elastic demand as markets get more in

597
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:09,080
elastic monopolis make more money as

598
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,760
markets get more elastic monopolis make

599
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,000
less

600
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,000
money why does that make

601
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
sense

602
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,000
yeah yeah insulin the perfectly in

603
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,000
elastic

604
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,919
good exactly you have to buy it so given

605
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,720
that they can charge ever the hell they

606
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,200
want this is the answer to the question

607
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,880
you might have first thought or some

608
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,120
might think is well gee if a firm's a

609
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,840
monopoly why don't they just charge

610
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,919
whatever they want why do monopolists

611
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,919
have to with they're price makers

612
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,000
they're the only game in town why don't

613
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,159
they just charge whatever the hell they

614
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,720
want and the answer is because while

615
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,720
people can't substitute to other firms

616
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,600
they can substitute to other

617
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,279
Goods so if it's a good if you're

618
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,039
monopolizing a good with there's very

619
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,120
good substitutes and you try to charge a

620
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,919
very high price they'll just switch to

621
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,159
the The

622
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,279
Substitute so if the elastic demand is

623
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,880
very large a large negative number they

624
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,720
can't make much profit sure they're the

625
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,360
only firm but if they're the only firm

626
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,480
making spearmint gum and people are

627
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,240
pretty different between spearmint gum

628
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,760
and peppermint gum they can't charge

629
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,200
outrageously high prices because people

630
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,240
just switch to peppermint gum but if

631
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
they're the only firm making insulin

632
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,080
then they can charge an outrageously

633
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,360
high price because there's nowhere to

634
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,720
go so the money monopolis make monopolis

635
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,880
in a perfect competitive market firms

636
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,440
are disciplined by competition from

637
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,919
other firms in a monopoly Market firms

638
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,480
are disciplined only by the elasticity

639
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,760
of demand that's the only disciplining

640
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,919
effect on the

641
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,320
firm okay so let's do a simple example

642
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,679
two books you guys probably had to read

643
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,960
in high school Huckleberry thin and

644
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,279
Fahrenheit

645
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,760
451 if you go on Amazon right now you

646
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,360
can get Huckleberry fin for about four

647
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,760
bucks in paperback or zero on

648
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,200
Kindle uh fahren 451 is about n bucks

649
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,279
and about the same on

650
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,919
Kindle why they're both twoo old books

651
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,840
people have to basically read them about

652
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,600
the same they're all high school

653
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,200
required books the marginal cost of

654
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,440
production can't be that

655
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,640
different of producing Fahrenheit for

656
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,840
they're they're slightly different

657
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,919
lengths but not that different certainly

658
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,799
un Kindle the marginal cost of

659
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,480
Productions comparable so why why is

660
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:30,120
Fahrenheit 451 so much more expensive

661
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,120
than Huckleberry Finn

662
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,720
do anyone

663
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,960
know go ahead you have an idea any

664
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,760
thoughts okay well the reason is because

665
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,760
in the US oh yeah go

666
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,760
ahead exactly in the US we have

667
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,279
something called copyright laws which

668
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:53,399
say that for 75 years after the author's

669
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:56,679
death only the author or his estate or

670
00:28:53,399 --> 00:29:00,279
her estate can approve production of the

671
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,799
book which gives them a monopoly Mark

672
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:06,399
Twain died more than 75 years ago Ray

673
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,760
Bradberry did not so as a result there's

674
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,679
no more Monopoly anybody with a printing

675
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,360
press or whatever it is to make an ebook

676
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,559
I don't know how you do that can make a

677
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,880
copy Huckleberry

678
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,200
Finn so it's perfectly

679
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,000
competitive okay and so profits get

680
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,480
driven to zero but fite 451 they still

681
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,200
have a monopoly right so they're making

682
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,399
profits now why is 451 everyone has to

683
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,799
read Fahrenheit 451 why don't they

684
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,679
charge a 100 bucks because then high

685
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,799
schools say you know what Fahrenheit 451

686
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,960
is fine but you know there's other ones

687
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,600
that are okay

688
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,200
too so there's some eless this demand

689
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,640
disciplining the market for Fahrenheit

690
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,760
451 but it's not as much as disciplin

691
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,519
the market for Huckleberry fin okay

692
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:53,320
questions about

693
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:59,039
that okay let's go on then and talk

694
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,039
about the welfare effects of Monopoly

695
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,559
because now we have the tools in this

696
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,000
class to move Beyond positive economics

697
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,440
talk about normative

698
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,039
economics and we have the tools to show

699
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,200
you that Monopoly causes our first

700
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,760
example what we call a market

701
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,440
failure let's look at figure

702
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,279
115 back to the example we used the

703
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,880
domain curve is 24 minus Q the marginal

704
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:29,320
cost is 2 Q same example we were just

705
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,240
using the monopolis sells six units at a

706
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,039
price of

707
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,360
18 okay the competitive

708
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,279
equilibrium would be eight units at a

709
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,440
price of

710
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,000
16 how do we know this well we just said

711
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,600
price equal the marginal cost marginal

712
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,440
cost equals 2 Q so that would be true at

713
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,720
qal 8 p equal 16 we all could see it

714
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,240
from the intersection the demand Supply

715
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,600
curves so the competitive case they sell

716
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,639
eight units at a price of 16 the

717
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,440
Monopoly case they sell six units at a

718
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:04,639
price of

719
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,559
18 what is the consumer surplus in the

720
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:09,360
competitive case what letters represent

721
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,480
the consumer surplus in the competitive

722
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,880
case at Point

723
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,799
EC don't raise their hand and tell

724
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,639
me come on guys help me out here yeah

725
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:21,080
loud

726
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:23,159
loud a plus b plus

727
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,880
C same person what's the producer

728
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,159
Surplus in competitive

729
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,039
case D plus e now now in the Monopoly

730
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:36,000
case what has happened to consumer

731
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:39,679
surplus it has fallen from a plus b plus

732
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,799
C to just a so consumer

733
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,279
surplus from the competitive case to

734
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,240
Monopoly case has gone from a plus b

735
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:50,760
plus C to just

736
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,159
a what about producer Surplus producer

737
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:58,399
Surplus in the competitive

738
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,200
case was just D plus e well now what is

739
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,399
it well they lose

740
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,399
e but they gain

741
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:10,559
B so what's happened is two things we

742
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:14,000
have

743
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,880
transferred area B from consumers to

744
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,360
producers remember that's sort of we

745
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,600
don't care from that in the total social

746
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,240
welfare framework we just care about the

747
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,840
sum producer consumer surplus we don't

748
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,120
care who has it so that transfer is not

749
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,360
important not consequential what's

750
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,919
consequential is we've created a dead

751
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,519
weight

752
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,679
loss of of

753
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:39,159
c+e we've created a dead weight loss of

754
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,639
c+e there's an inefficiency why because

755
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,000
there are trades that would make Society

756
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:46,360
better off that are not happening

757
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,840
remember if we went if we sold that

758
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,840
seventh

759
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,000
unit could the benefit of that unit to

760
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,360
Consumers exceeds the cost of producing

761
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,960
it therefore society's better off if

762
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,440
it's sold but it's not being sold

763
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,080
because this poisoning effect so

764
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,159
Monopoly has created a dead weight loss

765
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,080
and the first example the dead weight

766
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,480
loss and

767
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,559
Monopoly is the first example of what we

768
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,559
call in this class a

769
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,399
market

770
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,559
failure when I did welfare the last

771
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,120
couple lectures the only thing that

772
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,120
caused de loss was the government

773
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,960
screwing things up as long as you left

774
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,399
the market rip you got the perfectly

775
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,240
efficient outcome well here we're

776
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:31,320
letting the market rip and not getting

777
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,600
the perfectly efficient outcome now I'll

778
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,840
stop right there this does not imply

779
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,080
government can make things better we'll

780
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,960
talk about that next time all I'm saying

781
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,080
here is a simpler statement which is

782
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,639
unlike the perfectly competitive case if

783
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,960
you let the market rip you get an

784
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:47,320
inefficient

785
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,880
outcome that's a fundamental change

786
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,799
that's a fundamental challenge to

787
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,039
everything we've learned so far it

788
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,159
doesn't come from any magic or any

789
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:55,240
government intervention it's just the

790
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,639
way monopolis make

791
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,760
decisions okay so because monopolis

792
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:02,960
don't want to lower the price because

793
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,080
that's not profit maximizing we end up

794
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,679
not selling units that and that would

795
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,879
make Society better off so the private

796
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,200
incentives put another way the positive

797
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,359
and normative outcomes don't don't align

798
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,639
with the competitive market the positive

799
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,560
outcome was no profits that was also the

800
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,399
welfare maximizing outcome in a monopoly

801
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,919
case the private

802
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,720
outcome is different than the social

803
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,200
welfare maximizing outcome and that lead

804
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,240
leads to a market failure questions

805
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,800
about

806
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,359
that okay

807
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,000
now this raises the natural question

808
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,200
which was raised here and which has been

809
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,720
on your mind the whole time which is why

810
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,359
do monopolis have to charge just one

811
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,960
price what loss is that no firm charge

812
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,760
is just one price firms charge different

813
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,919
prices for different sorts of things you

814
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,639
know for different and we'll come to

815
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,960
some examples so what if we move to the

816
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,320
more realistic case where monopolist can

817
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,280
price

818
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,839
discriminate what if monopolis could

819
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,839
charge different prices for different

820
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:10,720
quantities well in fact what would

821
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,880
happen let's go to the extreme of

822
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,280
perfect price

823
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,760
discrimination Perfect Right

824
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,800
discrimination is a magag monopolist

825
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,680
could go to Every

826
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,760
individual figure out what their

827
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,480
willingness to pay was and charge them

828
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,680
that

829
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,359
amount that'd be perfectly price

830
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,280
discriminating monopolis they would

831
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:35,960
charge every person their own individual

832
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,359
price and that price will correspond to

833
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,000
their willingness to

834
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,040
pay what would that lead to that would

835
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,040
lead to figure

836
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:50,359
116 the first person person

837
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:53,160
one they are willing to pay that entire

838
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:55,560
um uh trapezoid that'll be to the left

839
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,839
of unit one they only pay a lot so you

840
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,400
charge them a lot all the way down to

841
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,920
the eighth person you charge them what

842
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,640
they're willing to pay which is 16

843
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:09,640
charge the eighth person 16 the seventh

844
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,160
person 17 the sixth person 18 and so on

845
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,599
why would you want to do

846
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,319
that well now what has happened to

847
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,760
consumer surplus someone raise their

848
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:21,520
hand and tell me yeah zero why is

849
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,520
consumer surplus

850
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,400
zero exactly consumer surplus is the

851
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,359
benefit you get from valuing something

852
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,599
above its price that's gone they're

853
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,880
charging you what you're willing to pay

854
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,560
so by definition there's no consumer

855
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,800
surplus so all the rest is producer

856
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,119
Surplus so the firm has converted the

857
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,440
entire Surplus to producer Surplus by

858
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,319
Perfect price

859
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,760
discrimination what else is notable in

860
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:52,400
this case with per price discrimination

861
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,480
firms will sell eight units so what else

862
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,319
is notable no dead weight

863
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,960
loss a perfectly priced discriminating

864
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:04,839
firm creates no dead weight loss why

865
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,160
because there's no poisoning effect the

866
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,560
poisoning effect comes from the fact

867
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,520
that if I want to sell more units I got

868
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,640
to lower my price well here I don't have

869
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,200
to lower my price to sell more units

870
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,800
given that I might as well sell as many

871
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,400
units as people are willing to pay for

872
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,480
that are above my cost so I might as

873
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,400
well do the welfare maximizing thing

874
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,920
which is sell 8

875
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,240
units this is the first inclination that

876
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,000
we have to car care about fairness in

877
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,480
economics because what this says what

878
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,160
the existing course would teach you so

879
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,079
far is I'm completely

880
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,040
indifferent between the perfectly

881
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,720
competitive case as illustrated by EC

882
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,599
above where consumers get a plus b plus

883
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,560
C I'm indifferent between that case and

884
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,200
the perfect price discrimination case

885
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,599
that is I'm indifferent between whether

886
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,680
consumer's

887
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,319
gift okay I'm completely indifferent all

888
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,520
I care about is the total right it's the

889
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:00,760
sum that can't make sense right it can't

890
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,960
make sense that I'm completely different

891
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,960
in a world where producers have

892
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,200
everything and where consumers have some

893
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,560
producers have some there's no way that

894
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,400
anyone would be truly indifferent in

895
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,880
those worlds and that's the first hint

896
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,119
that in economics we have to care about

897
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,480
fairness we have to not just care about

898
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,560
the total sum of social surplus but who

899
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,440
gets

900
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,720
what okay and we're going to come back

901
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,119
to that later for now we'll stick with

902
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,599
our definition we're just care about the

903
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,839
total but this is sort of the hint of

904
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,480
why we need to come back to

905
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,760
that okay so that is what would happen

906
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,480
with perfect price discrimination now in

907
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,560
fact okay um firms can't perfectly price

908
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,280
discriminate in fact firms can't go and

909
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:44,200
get your willingness to pay so in

910
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:47,560
reality what do firms do well they price

911
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,880
discriminate by trying to guess who is

912
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,520
more price

913
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,560
sensitive firms engage in price

914
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,200
discrimination and the way they do it is

915
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,400
they look for correlates of

916
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,640
Epsilon you you basically if you're a

917
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,040
monopolist you want to charge a higher

918
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,000
price to a low Epsilon guy and a low

919
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,480
remember guys gender neutral term and a

920
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
lower price to a high Epsilon guy so

921
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,760
basically if I knew everyone's Epsilon

922
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,160
I'd be done but I don't so what I do is

923
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,760
I look for signals that are correlated

924
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,200
with your

925
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,599
Epsilon so for

926
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:28,000
example airlines charge more if you buy

927
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,040
at the last minute

928
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,119
that if you buy four months in

929
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,680
advance why it's the same seat same

930
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,359
produ same marginal cost to flying on

931
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,400
the plane

932
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:42,839
yeah yeah if you buy the last you

933
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,040
clearly got to go okay you're a business

934
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,319
person's got a last minute meeting

935
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,359
you've gotta you've got to love one

936
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:49,480
who's sick who's got you got to go see

937
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,280
Etc if you buy four months in advance

938
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,280
you're clearly shopping you have lots of

939
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,920
options but if you're buying the last

940
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,119
minute you don't have a lot of options

941
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,599
now I can't charge you infinity because

942
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,400
as other airlines you could fly but

943
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,400
clearly you are less price sensitive if

944
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,680
you're buying at the last minute than if

945
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,440
you're buying four months in

946
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:12,760
advance that's one example okay why do

947
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,599
movie theaters charge less for Maes than

948
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,880
movies at night why do movie theaters

949
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,920
charge less when you go during the day

950
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,520
it's the same marginal cost again same

951
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,920
popcorn cost same projector costs why do

952
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,319
movie theaters charge less when you go

953
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,319
during the day

954
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,280
yeah well lower Demand by itself is not

955
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,839
necessarily the answer it's really about

956
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,760
elasticity of demand why are people less

957
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,920
price sensitive during the why are

958
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,520
people more price sensitive during the

959
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,640
day than at

960
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,000
night think about who goes to the movies

961
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,000
during the

962
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,240
day yeah mean people are like retirees

963
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,960
and things which have plenty of time in

964
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,000
their hands if you go to the movie at

965
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,960
night it's like you're done with work

966
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,079
you got to go at night you can't you

967
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,680
know maybe you decide between the 7

968
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:01,960
o'clock showing the 11:00 showing but

969
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,720
the bottom line is there's one time you

970
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,079
can go if you're going during the day

971
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,720
you've shown you have lots of time to go

972
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,119
see movies you can go at night you can

973
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,960
go during the day so anybody who goes to

974
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,560
movie during the day unless they work a

975
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,160
weird shift okay has basically shown

976
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,319
that they have more flexibility on when

977
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,640
they go to the

978
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:20,560
movie as a result you charge them a

979
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,119
lower

980
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,520
price this is everywhere you look all of

981
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,079
a sudden I've opened up to you a world

982
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,079
of understanding why price are

983
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,920
differentiated okay remember we

984
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,400
discussed this a long time ago we talked

985
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,079
about why the incremental large

986
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,760
drink at McDonald's the incremental cost

987
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,400
of a large drink is Tri is very small

988
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,920
compared to the cost of a small drink

989
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,440
because there's different elas demand

990
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,720
for the small drink and and the

991
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,000
incremental to the large drink so

992
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,240
everywhere you look when you go out in

993
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,880
the real world now look at prices you'll

994
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,560
see this firms pricing to try to Target

995
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,359
the lower prices to the most elastic

996
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,280
consumers

997
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,640
okay now perhaps the best example of

998
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:07,280
this was a example a few years ago with

999
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:11,079
Tesla Tesla sells electric cars you know

1000
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,760
and the original model S could go for

1001
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,560
250 miles on a battery charge what they

1002
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,200
said is we are going to offer a cheaper

1003
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,000
Model S that can only go about half as

1004
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,800
far about 125 150 miles per per battery

1005
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,079
charge so you can buy the more expensive

1006
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,680
one because it's got this fancier

1007
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,440
battery 250 miles you can go it cost

1008
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,280
more money or the less expensive one

1009
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,880
with a less expens less fancy battery it

1010
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,880
only go 150

1011
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,079
mil well um in September 2017 there was

1012
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,640
a huge hurricane in Florida and people

1013
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,920
had to evacuate and Tesla understood

1014
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,760
that the limits on how far you could

1015
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,960
drive Florida's a big state could get in

1016
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,200
the way of people

1017
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,079
evacuating so Tesla said you know what

1018
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,079
all cars can now go 250 miles on their

1019
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:56,680
battery people like what the what do you

1020
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,240
mean we can go 250 miles in the battery

1021
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,440
well turn out it's the same battery they

1022
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,040
just had a piece of code that limited

1023
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,920
how far you could go in the cheaper car

1024
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,000
why would they do that why would they

1025
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,040
literally have the same battery and

1026
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,119
literally add money to add code to limit

1027
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,119
how far you could go why' they do

1028
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,319
that yeah

1029
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,000
exactly there's two types of people

1030
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,960
people who have a lot of money and are

1031
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,079
willing to pay for a better car people

1032
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,480
don't a lot of money not willing to pay

1033
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,559
for a better car if they just simply

1034
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,760
said we're going to sell Modelo 250

1035
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,319
miles a bunch of lower income people

1036
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,000
wouldn't have bought it if they said

1037
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,240
we're going to let everyone go 250 miles

1038
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,359
on a cheaper price then they wouldn't

1039
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:53,040
have made as much money so they said a

1040
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:56,280
high price for a premium product to grab

1041
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,800
all the low elasticity consumers and a

1042
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,040
lower price for a less premium product

1043
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,800
to grab the high elasticity consumers

1044
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,839
even though the products were the same

1045
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,079
this actually uh Tesla is not Al loness

1046
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,040
when IBM first created the the uh uh

1047
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,680
digital

1048
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,800
printer uh it uh said had a home version

1049
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,079
which was much less efficient than the

1050
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,520
office version and it turned out someone

1051
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,839
took them apart and it was the same

1052
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,680
printer there's added crap to the motor

1053
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:26,680
on the home version to make it go

1054
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,079
slower okay because they want to take

1055
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,960
that same Advantage they want to be able

1056
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,440
to charge a lot for the office one

1057
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,599
because people are less price elastic in

1058
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,000
the office okay turns out you could take

1059
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,839
this too far Amazon tried to go further

1060
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,200
with this Amazon actually tried to set

1061
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:45,839
prices by IP

1062
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,200
address so Amazon literally an exercise

1063
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,559
where literally they would differentiate

1064
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,920
the price you'd see online by your IP

1065
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,920
address why would they do

1066
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,319
that why would they be once again

1067
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,280
regardless of your feelings about Jeff

1068
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,119
Bezos why would they do that why would

1069
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,000
they differentiate the price

1070
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,640
yeah yeah but how would they know by

1071
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,680
your IP

1072
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,280
address what's

1073
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:13,599
that P sales is one reason what else

1074
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,680
yeah your ZIP code that's another

1075
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,520
reason what else who's willing to pay a

1076
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:23,000
lot yeah what's that yeah basically if

1077
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,079
you're ordering from Goldman Sachs IP

1078
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,960
address they're like you're rich we're

1079
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,079
going to charge you a lot if you're

1080
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,319
ordering from some you know homeless

1081
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,680
shelter or some place people don't have

1082
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:33,440
any money they'll charge you less so

1083
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,880
basically they said we've got a great IP

1084
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,680
address is a great signal of willingness

1085
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,920
to pay will suck up all that consumer

1086
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,520
surplus by varying the price by

1087
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,559
willingness to pay they got busted and

1088
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,559
couldn't do it

1089
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:46,599
anymore uh they were told they couldn't

1090
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:48,319
do that now it's not clear why not uh in

1091
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:49,960
fact the reason why not you might say

1092
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,040
well look why shouldn't they do that

1093
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,880
they're increasing efficiency if they

1094
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,000
don't do that we're losing C plus e by

1095
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,240
doing that we're gaining efficiency

1096
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,240
they're selling more units they wouldn't

1097
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,760
have sold those low-income consumers

1098
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,079
Tesla wouldn't have sold those cheaper

1099
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,440
model X's or whatever they were so

1100
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,880
what's wrong with that and the answer is

1101
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,440
in a tral economics world nothing TR

1102
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,119
economics world we should have let Tesla

1103
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,920
do that we should have let IBM make the

1104
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,160
crappy home printer we should have let

1105
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,599
