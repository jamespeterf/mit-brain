9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,279
street between machine learning and

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,920
biology and I'm near haken I'm the

circuits here at the BR Institute and we

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,280
want to share with you today an exciting

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,360
challenge taking place this January the

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,879
Eric and Wendy Schmid Center is holding

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
the cancer immunotherapy data science

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,480
challenge through top coder in

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,160
collaboration with Harvard's laboratory

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
for Innovation science mit's department

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,840
of electrical engineering and computer

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,359
science gordian biotechnology and the

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,320
Mass General cancer center today we're

24
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,079
here to talk about why we're doing this

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,120
Challenge and also to discuss the

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,840
problems at hand we'll talk about cancer

27
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,479
immunotherapy using our own immune

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
system to combat tumors exciting new

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,880
biological data sets that could open

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,080
novel avenues for cancer imun therapy

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,520
and why we think machine learning is the

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,799
key to unlocking the power of these data

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
we'll also get into the challenge itself

34
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,240
can you design algorithms that identify

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
genetic modifications of tea cells that

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,240
make them effective at killing cancer

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,280
cells now for some of our viewers we

38
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,000
know it's been a while since biology

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,759
class in high school or college so near

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,960
let's talk about tea cells okay well te-

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,320
cells are the soldiers of the immune

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,960
system every time we're sick say with a

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,880
virus our immune system mounts a

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,479
response tea cells find attack and

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,960
destroy the cell that Harbors the virus

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,920
as a result we get better they also find

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,920
and destroy cancer cells at least some

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,960
of the time but one of the Hallmarks of

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,920
cancer that we Now understand that

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,759
cancer cells are very skilled at evading

51
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,719
detection by the immune system cancer

52
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,360
cells mimic our own health tea cells and

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,799
send signals that cause the tea cells to

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,160
malfunction right and when that happens

55
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,840
the cancer cells can start to multiply

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,400
out of control forming lumps called

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,319
tumors and these cancer cells can also

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,040
spread to other parts of the body

59
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,519
through a process called metastasis and

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,200
on top of that cancer is not just one

61
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,080
disease melanoma is very different from

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,800
leukemia which is very different from

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,319
breast cancer exactly what we know now

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,480
is that our genetic mutations actually

65
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,680
influence how well we respond to

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,480
particular kinds of treatment even for

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,080
the same cancer in other words one

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
treatment for one patient won't

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,360
necessarily work for everyone else but

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,239
there is hope we believe that the future

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
for Cancer Care is

72
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,800
immunotherapy cancer immunotherapy uses

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,040
our body's immune system to fight cancer

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,680
by boosting or changing how the immune

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,959
system works so that it can better find

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
and attack cancer cells yeah an

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,440
immunotherapy has already shown results

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,680
and holds even more promises if we can

79
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,560
make the te- cells attack tumors even

80
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,519
more potently than now then we can

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
eliminate any form of cancer and any

82
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,480
part of the body that would be an

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,760
enormous improvement over current

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,000
treatments but you might be thinking

85
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,280
this is Quite a feat where do we even

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,120
start how do we make immunotherapy

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,000
scalable and effective so this is where

88
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,640
large scale data sets and machine

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,519
learning really come in the Life

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,560
Sciences are in the midst of a data

91
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,159
Revolution where in expensive and

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,280
accurate DNA sequencing is a reality

93
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,760
Advanced molecular Imaging is becoming

94
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,239
routine and single cell genomics is

95
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,599
allowing us to profile millions of cells

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,120
in a single

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,439
experiment these Innovations and the

98
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,239
massive data sets they produce have

99
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,400
brought us really to a threshold of a

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,120
new era in biom medicine however with

101
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,760
this opportunity also comes a challenge

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,120
our ability to generate data is rapidly

103
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,439
outpacing our ability to analyze and

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,159
interpret it

105
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,640
to give you a better idea a single lab

106
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,159
can generate a data set that Rivals and

107
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,799
size the entire movie library of Netflix

108
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,280
here at the broad we have more than 100

109
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,600
pedabytes of data under management which

110
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,240
is 100 million gigabytes put simply we

111
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,560
have reached the limits of unaided human

112
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,960
comprehension but fortunately the last

113
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,479
two decades have witnessed not only a

114
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,680
transformation of the life sciences but

115
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,840
also the data science

116
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,639
as we all know we're living in the

117
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Golden Age of AI and machine learning

118
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,360
but unlike in the more traditional

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,759
applications of machine learning and AI

120
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,479
like recommender systems or online

121
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,479
advertising in the biomedical Sciences

122
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,240
the ultimate goal is often to understand

123
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,360
the underlying mechanisms for example in

124
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,919
our cancer immunotherapy data science

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,120
challenge we need to understand the

126
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,759
underlying regulatory Circuit of te-

127
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
cells in order to identif ify

128
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,000
modifications that will make the cells

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,440
more effective at killing cancer cells

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,479
so the causal aspect is really important

131
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,120
for this application and we will talk

132
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,280
more about this later but before that

133
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,919
near let's talk a little bit more about

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,639
imuno theapy and also our heroes the tea

135
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,240
cells so the idea of cancer

136
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,720
immunotherapy has actually been around

137
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,759
since the late 1800s initial

138
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,280
immunotherapy efforts sought to use

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
bacteria or viruses to mount an immune

140
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,319
response against the cancer

141
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,240
today there are two main categories of

142
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,560
cancer immunotherapy treatment which

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,240
both involve te- cells checkpoint

144
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,919
therapy and KT therapy the checkpoint

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
proteins which are on the surface of te-

146
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,360
cells are one of the ways that our

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,479
immune system self-regulates when

148
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,800
checkpoint proteins bind to healthy

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,680
cells they send a signal to the te- cell

150
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,960
to turn off but they also switch off

151
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,160
when te- cells bind to cancer cells

152
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,160
checkpoint therapies like the therapy

153
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,600
developed for advanced melanoma

154
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,880
block the off signal for te- cells and

155
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,639
tumors allowing them to kill cancer

156
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,599
cells in car therapy on the otherand

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,680
researchers actually remove a cancer

158
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,360
patients te- cells from their body

159
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,400
re-engineer the cells to make them

160
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,319
Target cancer cells and put them back

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,440
into the patient car te therapy is only

162
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,120
approved for a limited number of cancers

163
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,319
like certain kinds of leukemia non-

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,960
Hotchkins Lymphoma and multiple Myoma to

165
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
better understand how immunotherapy

166
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,080
Works let's take a close look at te-

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,199
cells we're going to use these Poké

168
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Balls to demonstrate the te- cells te-

169
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,759
cells start as what we call naive te-

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,440
cells who have not yet seen their target

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,919
each naive te- cell in your body has on

172
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,919
its surface a slightly different

173
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,599
recognition receptor which is created

174
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,880
through an amazing process of random

175
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,080
rearrangement of Gene sequences to make

176
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,240
the t- cell receptor or what we call the

177
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,560
TCR the TCR recognizes specific

178
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,360
molecules presented on the surface of

179
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,759
the cancer cell represented here in the

180
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,879
melanoma when the te- cell receptor

181
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,800
first sees its Target on a cancer cell

182
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,960
the te- cells become activated and move

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,560
through a series of Transformations so

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,440
from a naive t- cell the cell becomes

185
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,080
activated and forms what's called a

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,039
progenitor t- cell State this t- cell

187
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,599
state has the ability to produce many

188
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,160
more t- cells and more of itself so it's

189
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,800
self-renewing in the second stage it

190
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,520
becomes an affector t- cell and the

191
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,240
affector te- cell can divide fast and

192
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,800
kill tumor cells so so it recognizes the

193
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,240
tumor cells and kills them in the third

194
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,000
stage the t- cell enters what we call a

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,879
terminal exhausted State this state has

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,919
reduced functionality in proliferation

197
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,360
and a shorter lifetime so it can kill

198
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,840
the tumor a little bit but eventually it

199
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
dies in addition there's a fourth state

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,720
of cells that are currently in the

201
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,039
process of dividing these cells are

202
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,879
known as cycling cells and any of the

203
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,039
cell States we just talked about can be

204
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,039
in this uh proliferating state to make

205
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,120
more cells to kill the tumor now you may

206
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:05,120
be asking why do we even have terminal

207
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,560
exhausted States for te- cells it's

208
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,960
because we all have chronic viruses that

209
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,440
are controlled by our te- cells

210
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,199
throughout our life but these te- cells

211
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,120
cannot work at full force or they're

212
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,360
going to cause more damage to the bodies

213
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,599
and the viruses that they actually

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,000
protect against so at a high level

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,479
deactivated te- cells can be in four

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,159
different states a progenitor state

217
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,319
where they can proliferate a cycling

218
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:32,039
state of cells that are in the process

219
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,479
of of dividing an affector state where

220
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,839
they can kill tumor cells and an

221
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,760
exhausted state which is in fact the

222
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,680
dominant type in human cancers the goal

223
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,920
of this challenge is to identify genetic

224
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,040
modifications that increase the

225
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,360
probability of these tea cells going

226
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,240
into the progenitor cycling or affector

227
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,240
States but what defines a tea cell State

228
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,640
well humans in mice have about 20,000

229
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,760
genes and one way of characterizing the

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,880
state of a T cell or any cell is by

231
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,160
measuring the activity of each of these

232
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,680
genes in a cell with today's single cell

233
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,920
Technologies these measurements can be

234
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
done at a scale of hundreds of thousands

235
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,800
of cells per experiment so this means

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,760
that every cell is represented as a

237
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,920
20,000 dimensional vector and then by

238
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,920
performing clustering we can identify

239
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,760
the cells that are in each one of the

240
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,839
states so the progenitor State the

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,839
affector state the exhausted State and

242
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,760
the cycling state so let's now shift and

243
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,240
talk about how can we change the state

244
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,399
of the t- cell so the state of a t- cell

245
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,279
is defined by the underlying Gene

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,839
regulatory circuitry changing a single

247
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,800
Gene in this circuitry can dramatically

248
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,399
impact the expression of tens to

249
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,519
hundreds of genes and through that shift

250
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,279
the t- cell from one state into another

251
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,320
now Gene editing Technologies like

252
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,480
crisper allow us to actually go in and

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,959
for example remove a gene which is

254
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,880
called a knockout note that by changing

255
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,279
one Gene you may change the activity of

256
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,440
many other genes namely the ones that

257
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,800
are Downstream from the modified Gene in

258
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
the regulatory circuit so by cleverly

259
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,120
identifying which Gene to modify we

260
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,680
should be able to move te- cells from

261
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,320
one state to another and reduce the

262
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,200
probability of generating these

263
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,880
exhausted te- cells exactly but the

264
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,959
problem is for us is that there's

265
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,160
approximately 20,000 individual Gene

266
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,120
modifications or perturbations that we

267
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,920
could make to a single t cell and 400

268
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,760
million combinations of these

269
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,560
perturbations testing all these

270
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,120
possibilities would be unbelievably

271
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,160
timec consuming and expensive so the

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,399
question here is how can we narrow down

273
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,040
the 20,000 possibilities to just those

274
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,279
few perturbations that are most likely

275
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,560
to work to reach our goal so this is

276
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,079
where you and your algorithms come in to

277
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,839
our data science challenge to reprogram

278
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,040
T cells to combat cancer and to make

279
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,120
this happen we've collected a very large

280
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,800
single cell data set from tumors in mice

281
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,160
where we measured the activity of every

282
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,880
Gene in 100,000 t- cells we've also

283
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,320
knocked out 70 different genes one gene

284
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,600
knockout per cell so that means we can

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,320
see how removing one of those genes

286
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,800
affects the activity of all the other

287
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,880
genes and that can give us insights into

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,519
the underlying Gene regulatory Circuit

289
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,240
of a two Cel but of course we've only

290
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,279
performed 70 Knockouts out of all these

291
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,360
possible 20,000 Knockouts but now given

292
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,639
this training data set the challenge is

293
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,200
to design algorithms that can predict

294
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,160
the effect of all these other unseen

295
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,959
possible Knockouts and identify the ones

296
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,440
that would lead to a higher proportion

297
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,040
of cells in the progenitor State the

298
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,160
affector state and the cycling State and

299
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,079
less cells in this exhausted state so

300
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,000
here is the exact breakdown of the

301
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,880
challenge in part one you will predict

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,320
the effect of Knockouts that have

303
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,200
already been studied in the lab this

304
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
will allow you to see how well your

305
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,200
algorithms work

306
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,040
in part two you will propose new

307
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,959
Knockouts that based on your algorithms

308
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,800
could boost the cell's ability to

309
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,320
destroy the tumor and then finally in

310
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,560
part three you will come up with a

311
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,320
metric for ranking how well a particular

312
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,000
Gene knockout would shift t- cells to a

313
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,560
desired State and so we're really

314
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,959
excited to announce something unique to

315
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,279
this challenge the top scores from part

316
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:29,760
one will have their submissions

317
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,360
experimentally validated in the lab so

318
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
you can get to see how well your

319
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,800
algorithms actually perform in

320
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,880
controlling tumors and eliminating them

321
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,360
note that a biology background isn't

322
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,600
needed to participate the Eric and Wendy

323
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,880
Schmid Center will provide all challenge

324
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,639
participants with a short online crash

325
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,440
course and the broad Institute is a

326

global leader in biomedical research in

327
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,320
particular in genetic sequencing so this

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,360
is a unique opportunity to learn from

329
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,600
leading life science and computational

330
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
biology experts and the crash course

331
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,399
will take you to the biology of the

332
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,199
immune system explaining the function of

333
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,279
te- cells in a tumor you'll also learn

334
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,279
more about the technology that we use to

335
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,959
generate the single cell transcriptomics

336
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,279
and the perturb seek data sets that

337
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,760
you'll be working with and the Crash

338
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,399
Course will give you an introduction to

339
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,320
the biases of these type of data and how

340
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,160
to work with the data you'll be well

341
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,440
prepped for the challenge in hand the

342
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,720
challenge will run from January 9 to

343
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,279
February 3 2023 you can sign up as an

344
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,160
individual ual or a team and will be

345
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,560
giving out monetary prices to the

346
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,480
winners of each part of the challenge

347
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,360
totaling 50,000 US dollar and the top

348
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,720
participants will be invited to become

349
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,000
an author on the resulting

350
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,120
Publications another great product of

351
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,680
this challenge is that the resulting

352
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,320
data algorithms and code from The

353
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,839
Challenge will all be made open source

354
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,800
for the community to use and we will

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,120
also be adding to these perturbational

356
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,399
data sets as new experiments become

357
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,639
available and we would love for you to

358
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,560
remain engaged in this problem also

359
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,279
after the completion of this particular

360
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,920
challenge to achieve the goals that we

361
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,959
just talked about we're going to need

362
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,920
new ideas new ideas that break through

363
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,800
the bounds of the traditional approaches

364
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,440
that address the most pressing questions

365
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,959
and ultimately help us intersect machine

366
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,320
learning with Biology so not only will

367
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,680
you get to do something you love but

368
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,639
your algorithms could change the course

369
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,399
of how we treat cancer if if you haven't

370
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,910
already register now and we're very

371
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:43,320
excited to be working with you
