1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,040
And now I'm very much looking forward to

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,120
introducing the next speaker of today

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,719
who will be talking about new lean, the

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,120
new production system paradigm for the

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,120
automotive industry. And he's going to

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,359
highlight the necessary characteristics

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,199
for production systems of the future

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,520
while going into detail on the

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,800
corresponding building blocks from

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,920
digital transformation and artificial

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
intelligence including practical

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,439
examples from industry. So ladies and

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,000
gentlemen, please give a big warm

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,480
welcome to the executive director of

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,960
Franhova Institute for Manufacturing

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,840
Engineering and Automation. Here's

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,840
Thomas Bowen Hansel.

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:56,469
[Music]

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,320
Good

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,119
morning. Good morning everybody and

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
thanks for having me and giving me the

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,080
opportunity to talk about um yeah a new

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,360
paradigm a new manufacturing paradigm

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,360
and um we developed that paradigm or we

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560
started to develop it just one and a

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
half years ago together with the

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,119
automotive industry in um in Germany. So

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm located in Stoutkat um and and we

29
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,080
are in the middle of a transformation in

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
the automotive industry especially in

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
Stoutkat a lot of suppliers you can

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,640
imagine which are under pressure because

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,799
of the um transformation to more

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,799
electrified cars

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,200
um the the digital transformation is as

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,079
well an important topic. So there the

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,759
pressure is high on the on the actual uh

38
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,960
suppliers especially the suppliers in

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,000
the automotive sector and we asked um

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,880
Mercedes and BMW and Porsche and

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,240
Seammens and uh and the company Dur some

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,680
of you maybe know them they are uh um

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,000
yeah very famous for their surface uh uh

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,920
painting technologies which are mainly

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
used in the in the automotive sector and

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,920
together with the COOs and their teams

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,560
we started to work on on that topic. Uh

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,040
how should the production system of the

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,000
future in the mot automotive sector look

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,319
like? Uh that was the question and um it

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,800
was more or less driven by the topic

52
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,920
productivity. Ben already talked about

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,319
that and about the importance of

54
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,640
productivity and when you look at the um

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
situation especially on the situation of

56
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,640
value adding automotive value adding in

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,560
Germany there's a high pressure on

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
productivity in the moment because of

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,640
the high costs we have for our uh

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,519
skilled people for energy uh and uh

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,080
bureaucracy costs and so on maybe it's

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,720
similar to Austria uh but it's I think

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,120
it's even worse in in Germany um out of

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,440
my point of view. And when you look at

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
the productivity development of

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,480
economies and here you see uh an

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,640
analysis of Gordon who analyze the

68
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,959
productivity growth rate over many many

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,120
years um uh based on the figures of the

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,599
United Kingdom and the United States.

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,959
You see that the um increase of

72
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:25,920
productivity per year was dramatic up to

73
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,159
the 1970s, 1980s and then it goes down

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,239
and or it went down and and Gordon

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,640
expect that it will go down on the same

76
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,200
level we had maybe 200 300 years ago and

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,480
uh some other institutions like the IG

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,360
seta they say okay we think there will

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,879
be there must be a push yeah of the

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,159
productivity

81
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,080
increase because of the conveance of the

82
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,080
beautiful new technologies we will hear

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
about today and you all know we

84
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,040
mentioned already artificial

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,439
intelligence um digital tools but as

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,360
well biotechnology and other things.

87
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,760
This should help us to really push the

88
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,480
development and um why is productivity

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,879
so important when um this is as well um

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,360
an a study of of the IG seta uh they

91
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,280
said okay productivity is important or

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,919
let's check what is the influence of

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,800
productivity on the wealth status of uh

94
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,320
Germany we have here the GDP per capita

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,120
in 2022 and if you do nothing this will

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,840
go down till 2070

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,520
by

98
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,680
€6,000 um per per inhabitant in in

99
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,160
Germany. And then the question was okay

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,320
will immigration help us? Will uh value

101
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,840
adding participation help us? So the

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,400
people should work more not maybe 32

103
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,280
hours maybe 40 hours and in average I

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,680
think women in Germany work 28 hours per

105
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,199
week. So we increase that as well. So

106
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,199
what effect will that have on our wealth

107
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,960
status? And the last question was okay

108
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:09,199
we increase productivity by 0.8 1.2 or

109
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,800
1.5% per year and you see the biggest

110
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,039
effect not surprisingly is um the

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,400
productivity increase. So we should

112
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,479
focus um on that topic. Unfortunately,

113
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,080
Ben already mentioned that there is no

114
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,479
productivity increase over the last 10

115
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,560
years. In Germany 2011, we started with

116
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,080
industry industry 4.0 digital

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,479
transformation of industry, the

118
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,360
expectations were extremely high. And

119
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,680
when we look back now uh and when we

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,759
check or analyze the the last 14 years,

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,600
there is no productivity increase. In

122
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,759
some areas, uh, productivity, uh, went

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,280
down in some industry sectors and Ben as

124
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,080
well mentioned the driver for

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,039
productivity in industrial production

126
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,759
was in the last years the Toyota uh,

127
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,160
production system and maybe all of you

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,240
working in in industry sectors have

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
something similar. There is a Mercedes

130
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,919
production system. There is a Seammen's

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
production system in Germany. They all

132
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,120
have their own production system. So

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,440
they copied more or less the Toyota

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,240
production systems the principles and

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,400
this occurred in the by the in the end

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,800
of the 1980s driven by MIT professors uh

137
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,199
warm and Jones some of you know the

138
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,400
famous book uh the machine that changed

139
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,120
the world and uh now the idea was hm

140
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,160
maybe we need as well a moment like that

141
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,479
now in manufacturing and um we should

142
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,720
analyze what do we have to change u in

143
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,960
in order to achieve that productivity

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,199
increase, in order to maintain our

145
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,440
manufacturing in Germany, especially in

146
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,319
the automotive sector and maybe even

147
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,880
increase the amount of value adding uh

148
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,880
industrial value adding in in the German

149
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,240
economy. And um first of all we analyzed

150
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,440
okay where do we exec expect the the

151
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,080
main changes and the uh the result of

152
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
the study was okay in the field of goals

153
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,039
maybe a little bit because we have to

154
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,120
integrate sustainability topics u then

155
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,479
uh big changes on the on the process

156
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,120
level and as well most changes in on the

157
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,440
on the tools level. So we have new tools

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,960
which we can integrate and which we can

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,199
use to increase productivity. And

160
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,360
um uh one uh uh finding was as well that

161
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,680
we need more a systemic approach because

162
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,039
when you look at at the actual digital

163
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,039
transformation in manufacturing

164
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,479
companies, it's often use case driven,

165
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,840
right? So the the boss is coming home

166
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,240
from a conference like that and then he

167
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,400
goes directly to the shop floor and said

168
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,680
hey artificial intelligence yeah it

169
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,080
seems to be a gamecher in the future uh

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,639
what are we doing in that area and then

171
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,440
some teams some projects maybe a student

172
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,039
yeah he starts then with a uh artificial

173
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
intelligence use case and whenever the

174
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,280
bus boss come back yeah you switch on

175
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,599
the light and then you show him that use

176
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,280
case and when he uh leaves leave the

177
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,000
factory, you switch out the light and

178
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,319
you work like you ever did. Yeah, that's

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,039
in many

180
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,800
areas in many in many sectors that's uh

181
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,039
the actual situation. So it's very use

182
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,039
case driven. Maybe some use cases are

183
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,879
beautiful use cases they work but they

184
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
have no systemic influence on the

185
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,759
performance of the company of the

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,479
manufacturing system. So and as well

187
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,399
digitization is under represented as

188
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,680
well in the philosophy and in the

189
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,839
culture. So we we said we need more

190
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,240
radical changes and the question was

191
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,200
yeah in which direction do we have to

192
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,240
think and how can we achieve this

193
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,360
systemic change in production especially

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,040
in the automotive sector.

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,519
Yeah, I already talked about the

196
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,160
challenges. I don't I I don't uh think

197
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,000
that I have um to repeat it.

198
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,320
Um but but we have as beside the

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,600
challenges and the the competitive

200
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,519
pressure coming out of China um I heard

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,080
now that in China they have in the

202
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,720
meantime

203
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,640
350 automotive

204
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,880
OEMs. 350. Yeah.

205
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,360
uh and uh yeah no I think none of of

206
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,360
these companies do really earn money or

207
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
are profitable in the profitable in the

208
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,440
moment. Yeah. So the pressure there is

209
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
as well very high and we see now based

210
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,880
on the actual political situation the

211
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
the competitive pressure will uh

212
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,120
dramatically increase out of our point

213
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,200
of view. So these are not uh these are

214
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,000
very difficult challenges but we already

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,720
heard uh Ben mentioned that that in

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,600
South Carolina there was um a real

217
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
change in productivity and in in the

218
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,920
manufacturing potential because of a

219
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
more

220
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,200
um um yeah systemic approach ecosystem

221
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,839
approach and in Germany and as well in

222
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,560
Austria we have already these ecosystems

223
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
in place. We have excellent technology

224
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
providers. We have research

225
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,800
institutions. We have politicians who

226
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,880
know that manufacturing is essential and

227
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,680
they have to invest. um you have

228
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
universities, we have uh all these

229
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,839
market leaders in their niches and we

230
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,959
have excellent ecosystems and we have to

231
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,200
use that potential right and when we

232
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,360
talk about future production um

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,160
sustainability on one hand but mainly

234
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,440
productivity u is key and that was the

235
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,959
reason uh why we focused on that um uh

236
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,760
together with uh that team of companies

237
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,800
uh which I have um already mentioned. So

238
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,360
we what what have we done? We did uh a

239
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,519
lot of interviews. 108 experts were were

240
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,640
interviewed. We analyzed more than 68

241
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,079
uh technologies and approaches with uh

242
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,920
disruptive potential. And we um focused

243
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,560
that down on 27 specific profiles. And

244
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,720
we did as well a survey and we asked in

245
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,200
which areas do we expect um um the um

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,200
the highest potential concerning

247
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,440
innovation. So we divided the

248
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,680
innovations, manufacturing innovations

249
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,519
in these uh seven groups. Digital

250
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,640
innovations, automation, process

251
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,839
innovation but as well production

252
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,000
structures, the whole value creation

253
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,640
model. So the shift of value adding

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,560
maybe to suppliers uh everything as a

255
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,079
service approaches, things like that.

256
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
organizational innovations and

257
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,640
infrastructure. Infrastructure more

258
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,720
focused on electrification on

259
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,640
um new new networks which we have to

260
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
implement. And you see uh the

261
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,760
expectation is that in the digital and

262
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,279
in the automotion in uh innovation space

263
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,160
we see uh the biggest potential uh which

264
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:56,640
is for all of us for all of you uh I

265
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,680
think not very um surprising and um uh

266
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,680
in a nutshell we defined as well a

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,519
vision together with uh the companies

268
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,680
and we said uh till

269
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,399
2035 we want to produce environmentally

270
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,680
neutral and we want to achieve a 100%

271
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:18,480
higher productivity compared to 2023. So

272
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,360
a real um huge ambition. Um and the the

273
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,839
the focus was now to find out is it

274
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,240
possible to achieve these goals with

275
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:31,600
specific systemic approaches and u we

276
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,839
showed that based on on scenarios we we

277
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,120
u uh we built together with the with the

278
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,760
OEMs and uh uh we

279
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,519
built a kind of systemic

280
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,800
uh model with different um areas digital

281
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,800
the digital ization area, uh the

282
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,639
automation area, the ecosystem area and

283
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,519
the human and organizational area. We

284
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,000
put that all together and then um we uh

285
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,680
analyzed three different scenarios. Uh

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
the first scenario was the base

287
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,639
scenario. So we do nothing. We do it

288
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,720
like we did it in the past. Uh a clear

289
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,360
brownfield approach. The second one was

290
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,399
a more evolutionary scenario as well a

291
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,120
brownfield approach. So we include uh

292
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,399
the technologies in our approach as soon

293
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,440
as they are mature and uh the more

294
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,399
radical scenario. So with real more yeah

295
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,560
with more investments uh large

296
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,920
brownfield

297
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,040
approach in some areas as well a green

298
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,480
field approach u and as well we include

299
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,320
organizational uh innovations and and

300
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,760
more radical uh concept for automation

301
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,279
and uh

302
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,519
digitalization. Uh here's in a nutshell

303
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,040
the comparison of the main drivers. So

304
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,880
in the base scenario it's only

305
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,440
continuous improvement. The evolutional

306
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,399
scenario is focusing on emerging

307
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,480
technologies, standardization of data as

308
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,920
well on collaboration

309
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,720
um and uh intensive work together with

310
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,720
the technology suppliers and the more

311
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,279
radical scenario is focusing on a

312
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,440
massive improvement of the databases. So

313
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:16,160
data is everything and it's the core of

314
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,639
the production system of the future. Um

315
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,959
the complete harmonization of the system

316
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,680
landscape. So a completely new IT

317
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:28,000
architecture more driven by a so-called

318
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,160
factory operating uh system um uh a

319
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,360
continuous and efficient integration of

320
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:38,240
AI in all automation technologies

321
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,240
um uh high um yeah um um a targeted

322
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,160
increase in the automated automation

323
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,399
oriented product design which is

324
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,800
extremely relevant especially for the

325
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,440
automotive industry. So when we do not

326
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,000
change or if we don't if we do not use

327
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,360
the possibilities we have based on the

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,120
change from the classical uh car to the

329
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,959
electrified um car we cannot fulfill the

330
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,720
requirements of a highly productive uh

331
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:08,000
manufacturing. So we we have to really

332
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,160
design components and systems for

333
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,920
automation. that is also a key

334
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,880
finding and as well a very strong

335
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,320
improvement in

336
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:24,320
cooperation. Um the whole thing is uh

337
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,519
technologydriven finally. So u

338
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,519
technology is is key to achieve these

339
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,639
goals and uh we as well develop then a

340
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,199
kind of yeah structure for us in order

341
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,760
to really find out what are now the the

342
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,800
next steps to achieve these radical

343
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,959
changes and to see the effects in our in

344
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,440
our target system. And as I mentioned

345
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:53,040
for the time being um companies often

346
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,600
work on that uh enabling technologies

347
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,560
level very use case driven as I

348
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,399
mentioned a you see an AI solution and

349
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,399
then you use it you see a a new

350
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,279
augmented reality solution and you start

351
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,040
to use it in maintenance for example um

352
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,959
or you have some uh some digital twin

353
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,040
approaches or you try to integrate um

354
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,480
your uh your suppliers with the help of

355
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,920
a data base, but it's often uh driven by

356
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,880
by single uh technologies or single

357
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,920
solution uh modules. And in the

358
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,240
discussion with our u with our partners,

359
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,040
we said okay um is there something more

360
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,399
than a single uh technology and we call

361
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,360
that then systemic technology platform.

362
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,560
So the convance of different solutions

363
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,800
into one platform technology which which

364
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,759
really has the potential to be the

365
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
enabler for radical change in

366
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,279
manufacturing. And you see here some of

367
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,920
of these um systemic technology

368
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,480
platforms which we have defined um one

369
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,120
we call machine competence with which is

370
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,519
the embodiment of AI physical AI

371
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,240
approach. Agentic AI is a very important

372
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,959
topic. Um a factory operating system as

373
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,559
well to use the industrial metaverse. Um

374
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,880
some things like dexterity I will

375
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,959
explain later. And then you see you can

376
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,360
use different enabling technologies here

377
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,120
in light blue to create the systemic

378
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,760
platform. And this systemic platform is

379
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,600
then the main enabler for radical change

380
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,280
in that sector. The automation of

381
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,000
automation and that will then have

382
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,919
really an effect on your manufacturing

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,160
system. So you need this systemic chain

384
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,640
thinking uh in order to uh uh to really

385
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,320
have then the right decisions in place

386
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,760
and you should start on the right side.

387
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760
You should ask yourself what is the

388
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,200
effect I want to achieve? What kind of

389
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,039
radical change do I need? Yeah. And what

390
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,640
what kind of systemic platform is then

391
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,400
the enabler for that? And then you can

392
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
ask the question okay and what are then

393
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
the the core technologies in that

394
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,799
platform and who is the supplier? Do I

395
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,160
have to develop it by myself or do I buy

396
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,919
it somewhere and um which corporations

397
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
do I need to fulfill all the

398
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,720
requirements finally to achieve the

399
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,720
effect in my target

400
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,559
system? Yeah. And maybe some ideas

401
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,760
behind that topic uh systemic uh uh

402
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,160
innovative or technology platforms. Um

403
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,200
we see in the moment um that we move

404
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,520
more and more into the field of AI um

405
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,840
agents and the difference is compared

406
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,840
now to Gen AI that I do not only ask a

407
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,120
question and get an answer when I have

408
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,160
an AI agent he's doing something for me.

409
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,720
Yeah. So I I want to buy a material for

410
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,039
example and I have an a supplier AI

411
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
agent and I just ask that AI agent to

412
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,400
buy it for me and I need it for in a

413
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,200
specific quality in with a specific

414
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,600
price and then the II agent is doing

415
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,080
that for me or I have a customer order

416
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,799
and I have to blend this customer order

417
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,039
and then I ask the AI agent to do that

418
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,880
for me. So he executes something and

419
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,000
there's an action behind. So and that is

420
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,760
really a gamecher because these agents

421
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,840
they have memory functions they have the

422
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,919
ability to react

423
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,240
um they have predefined objectives they

424
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,600
can they are able to optimize themselves

425
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,640
and we see in the moment a lot of

426
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,840
developments going into that direction

427
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,400
especially on the softwaredefined

428
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,160
process um side. So when you talk about

429
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,679
business processes, order to cache

430
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,120
processes, you can use ex in a extremely

431
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,280
efficient way these new

432
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:33,400
possibilities. And um what we are

433
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,400
focusing on, we use this agent and AI um

434
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,400
approach to automize step-by-step

435
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,440
engineering processes. So we call that

436
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,360
the automation of automation. uh there

437
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,000
is a lack of engineers and when you

438
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,440
create a new automation line you have to

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
invest a lot of money uh into the

440
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,840
engineering uh into the software

441
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,440
programming and so on and we are already

442
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,240
uh um or we we we developed um a lot of

443
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,360
solutions in the in the last years uh to

444
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,000
automate engineering processes like the

445
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,480
automation of the uh planning of the

446
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,240
assembly sequence um we've created here

447
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,520
a startup uh offering that in the

448
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,480
market. The completely design of a

449
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,440
system, the layout optimization, the

450
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,280
risk assessment, the uh configuration

451
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,600
and and programming of the machines,

452
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,440
those the whole software and as well

453
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,360
some other uh features like uh

454
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,559
autonomous navigation and that will

455
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,200
dramatically u uh speed up your

456
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,799
engineering processes. For example, when

457
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,919
when we talk about the automated

458
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,240
assembly sequence, uh this reduces the

459
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,159
time you need for planning by more than

460
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,960
90%. So you're definitely faster and you

461
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,520
need um less experienced people to do

462
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,320
that. So this is a productivity driver

463
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,039
to think about automation of automation

464
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,600
or another example, this this example is

465
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,000
already in place. We we um developed

466
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:05,360
that together with Porsche.

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,280
Um so we we uh um developed an AI tool

468
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,960
to anticipate

469
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:16,640
uh customer orders and then we use this

470
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:20,400
uh virtual customer orders to um um uh

471
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,799
to already order uh the the longunning

472
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,720
components in the supply chain. And then

473
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,039
when the real customer order is coming,

474
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,840
we can just reconfigure the whole order

475
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,280
and we can use these components and we

476
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,120
can offer uh uh shorter delivery times.

477
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,760
Yeah. And this is the whole thing is

478
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,080
completely AI driven and Porsche is now

479
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,400
implementing uh that topic and that

480
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,520
helps to reduce the stock level and to

481
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:50,120
increase um uh the delivery

482
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,120
performance. Oh, the wrong button sorry.

483
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,600
Um, next topic I would like to stress

484
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,440
are humanoid uh robots. I think you all

485
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,799
heard about this development already and

486
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,559
uh you need a lot of enabling

487
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,960
technologies. Um when you go into that

488
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,520
uh direction of radical change with the

489
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,080
help of humanized robots, BMW is working

490
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,080
on that very intensively. yesterday or

491
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,840
um in in Shutgat already there is or in

492
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,240
Shukat is in the moment the European

493
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,840
robotic forum yesterday

494
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,960
uh Yakutza the COO of Mercedes presented

495
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:29,280
their humanoid robots approach and uh

496
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,720
Mercedes now in in invested around 4050

497
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,360
million euros intronic

498
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
uh they have a system it's called Apollo

499
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,960
I don't know if some of them of you

500
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,320
maybe know this system so they invest

501
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,039
own money into that uh startup uh in

502
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,400
order then to create their own humanoid

503
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,200
robots with this uh Mercedes star on on

504
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,880
the chest. Yeah. Uh looks very nice. Uh

505
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,840
and he showed some videos what what they

506
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,840
are doing as well. Milan Nelkovich is

507
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,200
has shown me some videos. They work

508
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
together with another startup in the

509
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,840
United States. So all the automotive uh

510
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,480
OEMs in Germany, they work very

511
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,080
intensively on that topic and I I'm

512
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,559
going to explain why. Um and the the the

513
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,720
core technology or the one or the the

514
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,640
very important technology enablers

515
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,240
behind that is to is to focus on

516
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,880
dexterity. So to rebuild uh the hand of

517
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,840
a of a human being for a robot. You see

518
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,640
some examples and u uh the big challenge

519
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,080
is then to reorient parts in a

520
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
mechanical hand. So you take some

521
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,640
something and you can reorient it and

522
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,039
then you can assemble it. Um Nvidia is

523
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,080
working on that. We are working on that

524
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,640
and we see uh there are real huge

525
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,960
increases in capability in the last

526
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,000
especially in the last six months and

527
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,320
most of these uh approaches are based on

528
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,400
virtual twins. Um so you have you create

529
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,799
synthetic data and with a synthetic data

530
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,919
you train then the artificial

531
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:03,840
intelligence uh methods you need in

532
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:06,120
order to realize these systems.

533
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,600
Just a

534
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,799
second. Yeah. And

535
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:15,120
um um and the the idea of of that

536
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,200
humanoid robot is that you copy a human

537
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,960
being and the and the humanoid robot is

538
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,720
able to do everything what a human being

539
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,039
can do. Finally, u most of the experts

540
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,400
say we don't know if we really will see

541
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,559
that in the future, but the different uh

542
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,480
building blocks of a humanoid robot,

543
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,120
these building blocks are very interest

544
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,640
uh interesting for for other machine

545
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,159
designs and uh we call that uh in the in

546
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,799
the meantime machine competence. So we

547
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,039
enable machines to be competent

548
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,600
competent like u human beings. So the

549
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,520
the tip of the mountain maybe is the the

550
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,679
humanite robot. But below that

551
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,400
development, our expectation is that all

552
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,320
machine systems, all production assets

553
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
in

554
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,480
manufacturing will become more and more

555
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,799
competent like human beings with the

556
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,640
help of the embodiment of artificial

557
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,559
intelligence. And so the idea behind

558
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,760
that um humanoid robot can be

559
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,679
transferred to all other machines as

560
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,679
well. And you can as well use then

561
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,279
technologies which are maybe developed

562
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,400
for a humanoid robot and you can

563
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,600
integrate that in your machine tools.

564
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,720
Yeah. And we some maybe some building

565
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,799
blocks like simple control, the uh

566
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,520
flexibility which is by design

567
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,039
integrated, the autonomous action that

568
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,559
you maybe have some handling systems

569
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,960
which are able to handle things like

570
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,880
human beings and as well that you can

571
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,720
easily train a system like that with the

572
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,080
help of imitation learning. And

573
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,400
companies like to for example um they

574
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,480
work in in sheet metal processing. They

575
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
already started to make their machines

576
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,520
competent. they worked as well with us

577
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,279
on on that topic. So we integrate um

578
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,600
human capabilities, competence

579
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,520
capabilities in machines so they can

580
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,799
make their own decisions, they can

581
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,919
optimize uh the process by by themselves

582
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,080
and and

583
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:15,760
end. And last but not least, I would uh

584
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,840
u like to focus as well on uh a

585
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,440
structural change in in manufacturing.

586
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,919
We call that the matrix uh production.

587
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,799
So when you look at the classical uh

588
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,480
automotive um

589
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,400
uh fac when you look into a classical

590
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,960
automotive factory you see the assembly

591
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,799
line like Ford has designed 100 years or

592
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,840
even 120 years ago and um what we do is

593
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:43,120
we uh we break now the assembly lines in

594
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,360
specific process modules and we connect

595
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,960
these specific process modules then with

596
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,200
the help of a fully automated

597
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,000
interlogistic system. So the all the

598
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,840
material and the product moves around by

599
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,600
itself on HVs to specific processes to

600
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,159
get processed and to get finally

601
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,080
finished uh and sold to the customer. So

602
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,000
we don't have these tacted hardly

603
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,960
interlink lines anymore. We have the

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,880
possibility that every uh product can

605
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,600
take another way through the factory

606
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,080
through this matrix of different uh

607
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,799
production modules. And the idea behind

608
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,360
that uh that is that we combine the

609
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,080
productivity of an assembly line with

610
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,679
the flexibility of a single workstation.

611
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,600
Yeah. So and that is what everybody

612
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,039
wants. We want to have more flexibility.

613
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,799
you want to produce a lot of variants,

614
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,039
different products but as well with a

615
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,039
high productivity and the combination of

616
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,440
both is then um the matrix production um

617
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,600
system and there are already um

618
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:45,120
companies like SEW in in Germany um they

619
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,200
have completely um implemented the idea

620
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,679
of a matrix production system and SEW um

621
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,159
they produce electric drives and gears.

622
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,880
We have a a high amount of different uh

623
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:01,279
variants and and products as well

624
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,840
custommade uh products and u um starting

625
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,399
in the 90s they implemented a lean

626
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,679
management system on a very very high

627
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,360
level. So a lot of u German

628
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,320
manufacturies manufacturers went in the

629
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,840
last years to sew in order to see how to

630
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:22,799
implement a lean system. But um um in

631
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,120
the last uh seven to to eight years they

632
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,440
uh they've seen that the productivity

633
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,440
increase per year went down and they

634
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,360
were not able anymore really to achieve

635
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,440
their productivity goals and then they

636
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,679
decided to radically change everything

637
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,520
into the direction of a full digitized

638
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,000
automated matrix production system. They

639
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,880
invested a lot of money into that. Um,

640
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,840
and they increased based on a very high

641
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,480
lean level their productivity between 30

642
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,960
and

643
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,799
50%. By decreasing um the delivery time.

644
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,799
So

645
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:02,640
within years ago when you want to if you

646
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,159
if you ordered u um uh a product at SEW

647
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,799
you have to wait maybe three or four

648
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,480
weeks. Now you get in you get the same

649
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:14,000
product within a week or less by 30 to

650
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,080
50% higher productivity based on that um

651
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,039
approach. So what I would like to show

652
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,440
is that there are many possibilities to

653
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,760
increase productivity that you have to

654
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,440
think somehow in a systemic way and to

655
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,679
connect the possibilities of the

656
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,520
different technologies. And maybe uh uh

657
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:36,159
two last statements. Uh one was we asked

658
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,000
uh during our survey uh the production

659
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,159
people um if their actual production

660
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,399
system provides the basis for radical

661
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:48,480
innovation and only 3% said yes uh our

662
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:53,320
production system is the basis for

663
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:57,440
radical innovation. only 28 said that uh

664
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:01,120
environmental or or sustainability KPIs

665
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,240
play a role in uh the production system.

666
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:08,080
Nevertheless, 57 said that they have an

667
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,720
up-to-date production system. Yeah. So I

668
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,320
it's funny, isn't

669
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,840
it? So my production system is up to

670
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,480
date, but it's not a basis for radical

671
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,080
innovation. So how will you survive in

672
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,559
the future? Yeah. Uh so that is that is

673
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,880
an issue and when you ask then

674
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,120
concerning the different barriers you

675
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,960
can you can read these barriers by by

676
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,279
your by yourself. Willingness to change

677
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,159
is always uh a very important uh topic.

678
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:40,159
So uh the attitude to really change

679
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,320
something um is often yeah on a on a low

680
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,279
level. So what is for us now the next

681
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,760
step? Um we try now to integrate these

682
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,320
ideas we have created into this house of

683
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,000
of uh production. We have a lot of

684
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,159
questions which we still not have

685
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,399
answered. You can read some of them.

686
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,799
Yeah. So for example, which systemic

687
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,919
platform is now really application ready

688
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,520
and should be integrated in the system.

689
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,360
Uh what what are the new design

690
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,000
principles for a production system? So

691
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,919
there are many questions open. So I our

692
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,520
idea was not to really answer all these

693
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,120
question with that project but to start

694
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,520
a journey together with the companies

695
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,880
now and maybe in 10 or 15 years I will

696
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,039
come back. Yeah. Uh or not I hope so I

697
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,520
will come back and maybe then I can show

698
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,240
you the complete new house of

699
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:31,200
production. Uh and then maybe like uh

700
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,520
WCK and Jones did then I can write uh

701
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,679
that nice book the machine that changed

702
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,480
the world maybe a second time. Yeah we

703
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,640
will see. I already spoke to Mr. Wik. he

704
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,120
will visit me in two in two weeks uh

705
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,960
about that. Um but that it's still a

706
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,960
long way to go. That's clear. Um but um

707
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,360
keep in

708
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,960
mind there will be a change. Um the

709
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,120
Toyota production system looks like

710
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,519
that. Yeah. We we have a discussion with

711
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,279
Seammens. They said we think about

712
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,000
something like that. Yeah. In the

713
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,000
future. So a fleet of spaceships uh self

714
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,720
similar real time connected and and end.

715
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,159
So that's uh their picture of the future

716
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,919
for their production system just as an

717
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,600
inspiration. But uh maybe as an advice,

718
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,039
Albert Einstein said, "Life is like

719
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,679
riding a bicycle. You have to keep

720
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,919
moving not to lose your balance." So my

721
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,000
recommendation is yeah, keep moving,

722
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,919
start moving. Yeah. And be successful in

723
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,919
the future. Thank you very much for your

724
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,919
attention.

725
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,240
And may I kindly ask you to stay with me

726
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,880
here on stage for just a couple of

727
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,559
minutes because we apparently do have a

728
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,440
little bit of time left for questions

729
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,919
from the audience. So checking the

730
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,559
screen, we just have the first question

731
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,960
coming up. Why will humanoid robots not

732
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,720
play a much stronger role in this new

733
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,519
paradigm?

734
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,440
Excellent question.

735
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:58,960
Um, we see a very fast development of

736
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,960
the capabilities in the moment. And when

737
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
you compare what these humanoid robots

738
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,360
were able to do maybe one and or two

739
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,279
years ago and and when you see them now,

740
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:12,000
it's

741
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:14,399
really an amazing improvement. Um, but

742
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,480
uh they are still not on a level uh of a

743
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,880
human being. And when you look at into a

744
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,519
classical assembly line in the

745
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,640
automotive sector, we are far far away

746
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,880
from the capabilities a robot would have

747
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,360
or should offer in order to fulfill

748
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,840
these tasks. Um so in the moment they

749
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,120
can handle a metal sheet and move it

750
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,080
like that to that and they uh recognize

751
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,200
yeah the the situation but they are not

752
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,279
able to do really complex tasks. One

753
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,840
thing and the other thing is safety.

754
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,080
Yeah. all these uh startups in in the

755
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,320
United States in that field they work on

756
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
the capabilities but they have no idea

757
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,640
what it really means when it comes to

758
00:33:52,080 --> 00:34:00,320
safety topics in production. Yeah, I I I

759
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,399
um had that during the uh human robot

760
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,000
collaboration topic and we developed a

761
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,840
lot of solution and finally after risk

762
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,679
assessment usually the the closer the

763
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,599
cooperation was between human being and

764
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,839
and um robot the slower the process was

765
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,079
and then we had an often very we had an

766
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,520
economic problem really to to calculate

767
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,520
it and to to to u judge uh about an

768
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,280
investment. We'll have to wait and see

769
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,280
and maybe ask the same question again in

770
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,040
about a year or so. Thank you very much

771
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,119
for sending in so many questions. We'll

772
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,280
do our best to at least answer two or

773
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,280
three of them. Uh what impact would

774
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,200
comprehensive process digitalization

775
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,599
have on production error rate and

776
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,919
employee satisfaction?

777
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,839
Uh an high impact on on production error

778
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,679
rate for sure. We see that uh in the

779
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,919
companies who have already implemented

780
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:52,240
these kind of of possibilities.

781
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:54,639
um um the the more data you have the

782
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,040
more stable is your process. Um on the

783
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,880
other hand employee satisfaction um out

784
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,839
of my point of view when we are able to

785
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,240
really um inspire the employees to work

786
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,560
with the tools and when we help them to

787
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,320
develop own tools. Uh there are many

788
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,119
companies in the moment in Germany who

789
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,400
start to develop apps by themselves with

790
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,800
low code uh uh approaches. Then the

791
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,520
satisfaction rate really increases

792
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,359
because they the employees often are not

793
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,599
uh in a bad mood because of the of the

794
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,520
high functionality. It's often the other

795
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,280
way around. Yeah. they have tools we

796
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,880
then they do not really work and they do

797
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,400
not really offer uh um the support they

798
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,079
want to have and when they are able to

799
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,520
develop something by themselves or

800
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,240
they're integrated in the development

801
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,560
and they get a customized solution which

802
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,400
really fits to their needs then usually

803
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,560
they are highly satisfied and motivated

804
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,960
to go on and to drive that digital

805
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,119
digitalization process right we'll try

806
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,119
to answer at least two more two quick

807
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,640
questions so in the radical scenario

808
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,359
there is no HR and leadership comp uh

809
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,480
compliment when one would expect a

810
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,440
change of 100% productivity in 10 years

811
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,960
requiring requiring more than technology

812
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,000
why is it if no priority uh it is

813
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,560
priority but I didn't uh uh talked about

814
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,200
that because my colleague was involved

815
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,000
who is uh focusing on on on that topic

816
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,240
he's an expert professor

817
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,880
u and I don't wanted to talk about

818
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,440
things which are not in my specific

819
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,680
research area. Yeah. But the these

820
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,240
topics are involved and and and it's

821
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,119
very very relevant to have human

822
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,160
resource and especially um the

823
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,680
leadership uh and entrepreneurship on

824
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,839
the table. So we definitely don't want

825
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,200
to forget about it. We do not forget. Um

826
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,119
I think that's uh basically a wrap for

827
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,720
this Q&A because there's no more

828
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,599
question coming up on the screen. Please

829
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,040
give another big round of applause for

830
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:55,040
Thomas. Thank you very much. Thank you.
