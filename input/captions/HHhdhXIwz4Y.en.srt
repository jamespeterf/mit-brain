1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,400
thank you good afternoon everyone um my

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,799
name is Dan Meyer I'm the CEO of cell

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,320
chorus and we apply machine learning and

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,719
artificial intelligence to study how

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,080
immune cells function and perform uh we

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,119
do this at single cell resolution and in

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,800
high throughput uh for some of the top

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,039
uh researchers and biopharmaceutical

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,960
companies in the world the reason we do

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,000
this is if you are re-engineering cells

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,359
uh recruiting cells training the immune

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,200
system inhibiting immune cells and you

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,399
want to understand how your product

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,840
works you want to be able to number one

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,879
understand how those cells move and

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,559
interact because they need to do so to

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,879
fight disease and just like every other

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,920
area of biology there's W wide variation

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,840
in how those cells perform so we want to

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,239
look at a lot of them but at single cell

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,120
resolution the most common way that our

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,719
customers and partners look at immune

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,840
cell function today is in a bulk live

24
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,840
cell Imaging assay we put

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,760
10,000 t- cells and 10,000 tumor cells

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,280
let's say into a vessel and then we look

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,119
at them over time to see how many of the

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,759
target cells die and maybe how many of

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,240
the immune cells die as well we don't

30
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,520
understand which cells perform best and

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,960
why and there's a lot of readouts we

32
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,400
don't get the good thing is these are

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
really well understood assays the

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,960
protocols are available and that's a big

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,799
benefit to us because we take a similar

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,600
approach for the user but we're placing

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,759
the cells into compartments that have

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
thousands of nanow Wells at the bottom

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,560
of them so an early version of our

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,360
device is at the bottom left and what

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,240
you see is an individual well with one

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,520
car T cell and three tumor cells and

43
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,920
when I play the video you see that this

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,000
cell if it

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,240
[Music]

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,840
plays I don't know if we can manually

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:54,079
play the video maybe

48
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,079
not thank

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,280
you oh maybe didn't come through so um

50
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,000
you can go to our website and I'll have

51
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,039
a link at the bottom you'll see that

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,520
this cell has to move form a synapse

53
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,280
with kill the first cell and then repeat

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,959
that process To Be A Serial killing T

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,520
cell what our algorithms do is identify

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
where the cells are classify them follow

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,680
how they move and then identify events

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,000
like cell death cyto kind secretion Etc

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,800
the reason we're using the algorithms is

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
we're making thousands of these videos

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,200
every sample we test generates as many

62
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,640
videos as Netflix has in its catalog

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,360
available to you as a user we're not

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,760
going to watch all the videos we're

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,400
going to use u a lot of computer vision

66
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,920
AI in order to do that for us that gives

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,200
us number one a lot of readouts number

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,319
two they're at single cell and number

69
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,080
three we can filter and just look at

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,599
cells that kill or don't kill just look

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
at cells that form a synapse or don't

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,200
form a synapse um and then if you're

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,519
interested in a particular cell or set

74
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,120
of cells we can pick them and do single

75
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,760
cell transcriptional sequencing Etc uh

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,879
further down the line um so number one a

77
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,400
common question I get is does it work

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,040
we've got data in more than 20

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
peer-reviewed Publications across a

80
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,599
range of cell types and applications

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,519
Etc uh number two uh does the market

82
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,519
value the data and we've opened an early

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,799
access lab where we are getting paid uh

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,799
in order to run assays for Designing new

85
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,959
therapies selecting lead candidates

86
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,040
quantifying responders and

87
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,080
non-responders evaluating potency and

88
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,840
viability of manufactured cells Etc um

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,840
we're sometimes a little bit of a unique

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
startup when we talk about customers the

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,200
they pay pay for the data uh we don't do

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,239
it for free um and so we do uh we do

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,760
know that people value the data uh and

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
importantly throughout all these

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,840
applications so for early research for

96
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,439
pre-clinical development and selecting

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,159
lead candidates for predicting response

98
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,000
in the clinic and doing process

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,799
development and Manufacturing analytics

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,680
these are fundamentally the same assay

101
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,720
so people can under have data to compare

102
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,439
to from early in their process all the

103
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,720
way through to process development uh we

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,560
do have have clinical Diagnostic and

105
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,040
prognostic applications which we're not

106
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,360
pursuing now because those have FDA

107
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,200
regulations potentially and take longer

108
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,360
and cost more uh one uh great example of

109
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,680
the platform we published with kite MD

110
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,720
Anderson and others uh this summer where

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,080
we took clinical product from um axis

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,840
cell ctis cell as well as clinical

113
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,560
development product and showed that

114
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,360
migration and serial killing uh is

115
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,039
associated with complete response

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,680
compared to dep partial and

117
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,000
non-responders um it's a short

118
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,080
presentation I would go into that in

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,320
more detail um let me know if you would

120
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,080
have any questions on that or other

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,600
examples um so we're actively running

122
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,039
the Early Access lab and we're about to

123
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,680
launch product working with uh mostly

124
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,840
Cell Therapy antibody and vaccine

125
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,800
companies there are also applications in

126
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,600
small molecules and other areas and

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,240
we're talking to Partners um for

128
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,800
preferred cro relationships um

129
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,840
instrument part Imaging instrument

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,479
Partnerships and then uh also

131
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,680
International distribution um and if

132
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,880
you'd like to see a video which is

133
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,680
