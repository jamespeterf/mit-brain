1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,199
okay so today we're just going to go

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,359
through some topics and um we stop me

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,840
when you when you are I want to um first

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,960
thing I'll do is just talk a little bit

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,519
about some of the things in my research

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,480
and some of them are connected with a

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,160
topic that's lingering in the back of

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,160
this class that um but that's not

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,520
explicit and that is this the second

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,320
adjacent field of statistical and pure

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,079
math um sort of computational or

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
musicology research that is not directly

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,320
computational so we'll do a little bit

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,960
with that um you'll find on the on the

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,239
canvas site there's a very cool uh I

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,079
think it's like nine page it's really

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,600
short it has lots of pictures uh article

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,320
that I'd like you to take some time to

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,719
read by Leon H uh hackford who um wrote

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,640
a whole book on mathematics and music

21
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,240
which is very cool but I find the most

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
cool thing about that is the Final

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,520
Chapter how not to mix math and music

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,920
and the ways people have mixed math and

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,159
music and got things really um wrong so

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,880
uh might bring that up a little bit more

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,960
so we'll do a little bit with some

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,960
statistical and math things uh that

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,119
relate to my own research too okay so I

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,799
um I'm trained as a um actually let me

31
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,759
turn off this light somehow yep is that

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,880
good I'm trained as a medieval music

33
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,159
historian so uh I really really got into

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,399
Medieval music you'll hear little clips

35
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,680
of it here and there and

36
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,200
um and that was you know really what I

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,600
wanted to do when I programmed on the

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,000
side uh to make some spending money and

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,159
things like that when I got into

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,439
Medieval music I thought I'd be looking

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
at things that are really beautiful like

42
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,880
this all the time these are uh people

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,439
playing a little crank or her Gertie

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,399
type thing and stuff and there are these

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,119
beautiful beautiful music manuscripts

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,000
this is from the early 14th C Century

47
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:14,519
called the um the novel of Fel the horse

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,519
named Fel the Randa Fel and you know

49
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,599
they're all really really gorgeous or

50
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:24,120
there's the the original Carmin Brana

51
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:26,560
that um that Carl ORF based his uh music

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,400
off of yes this is what music notation

53
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,920
once looked like um and then you know

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,120
gorgeous books in the shape of a heart

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,680
or um so I started focusing on the 14th

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,560
century in Italy where we have this one

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,840
really amazing book this called the

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,280
squatchy aupi codex has these beautiful

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,120
pictures of all the musicians who are um

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,560
who are in there and it's great I think

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,720
it's valued around $35 million or

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,000
something like that so I thought I'd be

63
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,000
working on this well it turns out people

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,120
have been doing Medieval music research

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,040
for I know hundreds of years and guess

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,640
what they've all studied the really

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,720
pretty books so if you wanted to go into

68
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,200
this in the you know around 1998 2000

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,920
whenever I really got it started about

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,400
25 years ago uh here's what's left for

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
us to

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,959
study little things like that you can

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,440
kind of see the the music here here and

74
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,560
stuff like that or um this is one of the

75
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,480
ones I've been looking at uh worms eat

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,920
them ravages of time or other little

77
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,680
indignities um that the music is wrapped

78
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,519
up to keep people's um sewage payment

79
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,879
records you have to pay somebody to

80
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,760
clean out your chamber pots and you want

81
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,000
to make sure that somebody's paid their

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,640
bill and so you know you wrap it in a

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,959
piece of worthless music and you do that

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,040
um well when you're wrapping music on

85
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,239
top of other documents sometimes the

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,480
document smaller than the music so no

87
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,360
problem you trim the music and uh then

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,640
it fits there and some people um you

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,840
know there's there's nothing important

90
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,040
on the left side of a score right I mean

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
just clefts time signatures key

92
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,720
signatures you know you know nothing

93
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,840
like that they used a lot of cffs back

94
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,280
then um and then sometimes you wanted

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,440
things to look really nice so you would

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,479
uh wipe off wash off or scrape off all

97
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,440
the music that was there so that you

98
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,000
know your cover looked a little nicer

99
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,680
and then once you've scraped everything

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
off it's all parchment and Vellum and

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,720
stuff uh then you can reuse it for in

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,680
this case Church landold Holdings in

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,280
Florence

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,320
um and then there's these little streps

105
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,320
that you find sometimes that you weren't

106
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,080
even sure are music but oh th those kind

107
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,919
of look like quarter note stems quarter

108
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,680
note stems and stuff like that so uh and

109
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,919
this is what was left for me so I became

110
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,759
sort of a music fragment scholar and um

111
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,479
my things are all on fragments of

112
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,720
polyphonic music from The 14th Century

113
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,240
so I wanted to look at these things and

114
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,960
you know how to move forward uh one of

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,479
the things back then you with no

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,759
computers is just spend a lot of time so

117
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,320
one of the things they were really good

118
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,560
about then is that they like who was

119
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,360
told that in a music class when you

120
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,759
write a quarter

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,160
note that's a very bad one when you

122
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,639
write a quarter note its stem should be

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,160
exactly an octave long and so therefore

124
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,919
it's kind of exactly like this I don't

125
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,560
know if people are still taught that

126
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,080
well they were very good at that so you

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,440
can kind of figure out based on the

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,039
heights the stems What notes must have

129
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,000
been cut off there and where they are

130
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,000
and you just stare for hours and hours

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,840
and hours of other books until

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,479
eventually you find one where every one

133
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,000
of the stems lines up I had to squish

134
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,880
this by about 10% to get it but things

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,720
like that or for something like this you

136
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,600
just uh there's three parts they wrote

137
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
the parts separately back then kind of

138
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,639
like I don't know iterating through the

139
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,960
recurse method and not the flatten

140
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,199
method and so um part one part two part

141
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
three and so you TR try every

142
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,680
combination of clef and time signature

143
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,240
and key signature until you finally find

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,199
where things um line up then use your

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,800
knowledge of Music Theory from The 14th

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,479
Century to fill in the missing parts and

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,560
eventually your friends record the piece

148
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,560
for you

149
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,550
[Music]

150
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,560
um then when the notes get big it's what

151
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
we actually know

152
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,960
so anyhow those was some of the things

153
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,440
and and um then first place where

154
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,319
computers really started coming in uh

155
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,000
was about when we started getting nice

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,039
color photographs before everything was

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,599
black and white photoc copies and stuff

158
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,560
and um I with some other people and some

159
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,479
other people independent of me all came

160
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,639
up about the same time with a technique

161
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,560
that um that if you measured the colors

162
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,120
of the overwriting and the colors of the

163
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,560
under writing the ink would probably be

164
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,199
different so you could remove one and

165
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,800
bring the other up and so we had these

166
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,520
various computer uh techniques for

167
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,280
getting rid of the overwriting and

168
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,280
getting to the music

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,199
underneath but um everything after this

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,560
was still going to be done by hand so I

171
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,120
started thinking about ways to use

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,599
statistics and computers to do various

173
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,520
things so about this time started

174
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,120
creating music 21 and if you ever wonder

175
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,759
why there's some things that are obscure

176
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,160
music 21's sole purpose was to try to

177
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,240
identify music fragments like that and

178
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,319
everything else that this class has uh

179
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,680
sort of come about has just been sort of

180
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:48,240
a side uh side project um

181
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,960
so while I was building that I switched

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,520
into sort of a statistical mode so we'll

183
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,479
get back to music 21 in a bit but first

184
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,960
want to think about some of the things

185
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,759
that that were coming up with all these

186
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,039
fragments and I was trying trying to

187
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,159
figure out what they were and that meant

188
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,080
I would need to find another piece that

189
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:09,919
was like that but the odds that another

190
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,159
piece would exist that matched up with

191
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,879
the music I was told were really really

192
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:18,159
low uh in fact uh a very famous uh

193
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,280
article by uh somebody who's very famous

194
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:24,280
in my field Nino Pera um the oral and

195
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,800
written traditions of Music said that um

196
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,599
the surviving music from the Middle Ages

197
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,399
is the tip of the iceberg and that

198
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,080
metaphor ended up being uh quoted and

199
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,800
reused in whole bunch of other articles

200
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,800
that you don't need to see here but um

201
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,959
so th this became sort of what everybody

202
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,959
knew so if you're thinking about music

203
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,880
from you know 600 years ago and you

204
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,920
think about all the things you've lost

205
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,480
in your 20 years of life for however

206
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,839
long um what percentage of things would

207
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,640
have survived from 600 years

208
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,800
ago or would be lost would be lost about

209
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
90%

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,240
99%

211
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,000
99.9% these are all numbers that I found

212
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,800
people said and then somebody said

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,440
basically everything so I I have to

214
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,360
convert everything to a number that's

215
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,760
pretty close to basically everything for

216
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,079
me

217
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,600
um I'm going to skip over that we don't

218
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,720
have all the time in the world um so I

219
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,519
started to think about some statistical

220
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,079
methodologies that could um that could

221
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,839
help in this and one of the things that

222
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:34,519
we have in some cases is uh this is a

223
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,360
table of contents for a book of music

224
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,320
from The 14th Century where the book

225
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,560
doesn't exist but the table of contents

226
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,959
does so I started looking at okay here's

227
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,640
all the pieces that do not

228
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,760
exist and then here's all the pieces

229
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,360
that do

230
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:56,240
exist and stting to look at the

231
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,480
ratios and in this particular manuscript

232
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,320
it looks like about 68% of them survive

233
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,760
so that was that was the first thing

234
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,320
that maybe the

235
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,760
99.9999 number didn't exist and then I

236
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,200
looked at there's a poet bunch of poetry

237
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,440
manuscripts so this is um one from about

238
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,440
the time of Dante or chasser um by a not

239
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,120
very good poet named kenani but one of

240
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,839
the things that makes him a bad poet

241
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,160
that's really good is that when he gets

242
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,320
into something when he's talking about a

243
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,320
feast he will list for the next 50 lines

244
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,800
everything they possibly ate and when it

245
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,320
gets to a concert he lists um with the

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,320
viola

247
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,720
we played our Mayday songs we just had

248
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,440
Mayday uh so these are the MayDay songs

249
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,200
like the rose that never changes its

250
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,120
color sweet um sweet taste and so on and

251
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,680
these all look like names of songs and

252
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,240
so we can look at for each one of them

253
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,920
do we have a song by that name or do we

254
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,920
not and so we have how many are known

255
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,440
how many are unknown and we

256
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,200
eventually get to a number that looks a

257
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,760
little bit similar to the last one about

258
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,680
71%

259
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,320
survive so I was kind of going through

260
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,560
this the chronology is a little bit

261
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,320
wrong I had to justify this later but

262
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,720
first I was thinking about how animal

263
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,519
biologist uh ecologists count animals um

264
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,800
has anyone taken a biology class or

265
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,120
something where you do population

266
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,399
estimates yeah what so one of the ways

267
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,040
that you can do it is you um C you want

268
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,839
to know how many deer are in the forest

269
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,639
right so you go and you capture as many

270
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
deer as you can in a month and a half

271
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,560
you you come back smelling pretty bad

272
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,040
and stuff but every time you find a deer

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,880
you tag its uh ear or some way in some

274
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,279
way that you can identify this is a deer

275
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,639
that I saw and you come back several

276
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,160
months later or whatever and then you

277
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:55,000
count deer again and the percentage of

278
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,880
deer that um that we're tagging the

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,600
first time give you some sense of or the

280
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,120
inverse of it gives you some sense sense

281
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,000
of how big the population is if you

282
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,760
tagged 100 deer the first time and you

283
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,519
come back later and you only find then

284
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,680
you capture 100 more deer and you only

285
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,800
Capt see two of them are tagged you know

286
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,839
there's a huge population of deer out

287
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,120
there similarly if you captured 100 deer

288
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,519
and next time you capture 100 deer 98 of

289
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,519
them are tagged you probably saw most of

290
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,959
them so started thinking about well if a

291
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,040
piece appears in one manuscript we'll

292
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,839
tag that piece and then we'll see how

293
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,120
often it appears in another

294
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,120
manuscript so I started coming up with

295
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,519
formulas uh to do this type of thing and

296
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
I realized that that there's an equation

297
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,880
that tells us the number of missing

298
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,560
pieces all you have to do is you take

299
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,920
the number of pieces you originally had

300
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,760
and you multiply by the probability that

301
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,199
any piece would be missing tell me if

302
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,839
I'm wrong you're the MIT students uh it

303
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,519
equals the total number of missing

304
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,760
pieces and it's a super great super

305
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,800
simple formula except that it's a

306
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,120
formula with three unknowns we don't

307
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,120
know any of these three numbers

308
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:07,440
but we can kind of figure out um some of

309
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,199
these things so we can look at um well

310
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,320
what's the probability that a given

311
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,279
piece would be in a manuscript now we'll

312
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,760
start with the assumption that every

313
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,240
piece is sort of selected randomly so we

314
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,760
start with how many pieces are there in

315
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
a manuscript is just like a collection

316
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,440
you know like a box set of of lots of

317
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,800
tunes how many pieces are there in that

318
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,560
manuscript we'll call that R subi and

319
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,959
you divide it by the total number of

320
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,519
pieces that were originally copied so we

321
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,720
know how many pieces are in a manuscript

322
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,320
because we can count that that survives

323
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
but we don't know that so we just move

324
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,639
our unknown to another

325
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,000
place so we can also figure out what's

326
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,839
the probability a piece is not in a

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,680
given manuscript what's the what's the

328
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,920
formula just see if you're awake if this

329
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,560
is the F Formula it's in the manuscript

330
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,360
what do we do one minus good good we're

331
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,759
all on same page there great so what's

332
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,040
the probability that it's not in too

333
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,040
many

334
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,040
scripts you just take the first

335
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,120
probability and you multiply by the

336
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,720
second one in the assumption that these

337
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,639
are independent and so try to keep ones

338
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,639
from different places whatever so

339
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,480
then what's the probability that any

340
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:21,880
given piece is not in any of there were

341
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,880
at that point 85 surviving

342
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,800
manuscripts well you just have something

343
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,720
like

344
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,600
this and that gives us takes uh but are

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,160
two unknowns that gives us the

346
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,680
probability that a piece is

347
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,839
missing so we can go back to our

348
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,600
original

349
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,480
equation

350
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,160
and plug that

351
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,360
in and all of these have n as a

352
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:55,440
denominator so now we've at least

353
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:59,160
reduced our U giant we've reduced our of

354
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,920
our Master our main equation into two

355
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,000
unknowns so we're getting a little bit

356
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,480
better then we

357
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,480
thought what how many pieces were

358
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,680
missing well the number of pieces that

359
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,000
were missing is the number of pieces

360
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,720
that originally were minus the number of

361
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,440
pieces that

362
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,639
survive

363
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,279
so we can count the number of pieces

364
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,880
that survive it takes a long time

365
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,600
actually to to figure out every single

366
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,560
thing because people count differently

367
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,800
but we can kind of reduce this entire

368
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,720
equation

369
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,800
to one equation one unknown and at this

370
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,440
point I was thinking I must have screwed

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,680
up something really really bad I have a

372
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,319
music degree I don't have a stats degree

373
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,000
this seems like a pretty fundamental

374
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,880
equation to have and it turns out people

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,759
had been talking about equations like

376
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:55,720
this a lot in the 60s or so but um back

377
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,519
then it was all about what's the way

378
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,440
that you solve an equation like this

379
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,680
with 85 you know it's a what it's a 85th

380
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,519
power equation or something like that um

381
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,880
you know and so all of it was on the

382
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,480
high math that I don't understand that

383
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,120
can get you um something to this this

384
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,880
answer but um this is my first uh

385
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,959
computational thing it's in a language

386
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,360
called Pearl where if you know it you're

387
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,639
lying about your age uh it was the the

388
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,399
big uh it was the language that built

389
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,480
the internet in the 9s um things and the

390
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,040
one of the things you can do is you can

391
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,160
look at at um guess various numbers and

392
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,399
look at the error between the left side

393
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,240
of the equation and the right side of

394
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,560
the equation until you find the number

395
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,560
that comes closest to balancing it so

396
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,240
you just kind of try everything and you

397
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,079
multiply everything

398
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,920
out and since this isn't really a class

399
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:54,360
about that but it turned into um saying

400
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,040
that the percentage of missing pieces

401
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,639
varied by genre by type of piece it was

402
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,120
interesting part is that the ma the mass

403
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,919
the music written for sacred Services

404
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,319
survives uh has more missing than the

405
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,199
ones for everyday sort of dancing and

406
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,559
love making and all that stuff and I

407
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,439
think that's because uh over time nobody

408
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,000
could read this music um so the only

409
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,280
reason somebody would keep it around is

410
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,240
for the text and you if you're um

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,360
running a church you already have lots

412
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,079
of copies of the text of the mass but

413
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,600
the song about you know we all went off

414
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,080
into the woods uh each one is a pair and

415
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,360
we all came back as three um they you

416
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,039
know that that's people still keep

417
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,240
around so those sort of body songs uh

418
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:46,240
have the least

419
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:51,280
missing so it turns out that our best

420
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:55,159
estimates now are that about

421
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,799
25% of the pieces maybe 50% I don't know

422
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,480
maybe 60 maybe I'm off by a little bit

423
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,799
you know by a logarithm order of

424
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,559
magnitude or something but we can

425
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,960
actually really say something about

426
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,320
Medieval music based on the fact that

427
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,039
much of it

428
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,120
survives and I was very very scared that

429
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,559
somehow I had made a math error and

430
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,919
stuff until there was just a math

431
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,679
disertation at Yale that uh verified all

432
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,919
the work and stuff so I'm finally

433
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,200
finally not worried I'm going to have to

434
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,320
do a retraction of one of my biggest

435
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
papers okay so now we're going to get

436
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,960
back to these

437
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,559
little uh scores and once I had sort of

438
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,360
convinced myself that a good chunk of

439
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,200
the time three4 of the time was saying

440
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,120
we're going to be able to figure out

441
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,799
what music is on here because it's going

442
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,799
to be in some other piece we already

443
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,320
have so there's this collection that I

444
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,200
mostly use it's called polyic music The

445
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,039
14th Century we have it over in the

446
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,919
Lewis music library it's beautiful it's

447
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,440
expensive and things comes in these

448
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,600
gorgeous green volumes and there's a lot

449
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,520
of them all the music from The 14th

450
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,039
Century uh it's about 20 it's 25 volumes

451
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,000
in this series and then there's been

452
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,760
some others since there so this gives

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,919
you a sense of uh what it is and

454
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,360
um now MIT was able I'm going to skip

455
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:24,840
some of these MIT was able to help me um

456
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,640
get some of this into um into a computer

457
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
so we'll get on to that in a little bit

458
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,360
but what what if you want to do if if

459
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,159
you want to find if any of these pieces

460
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,720
has a match in another thing because

461
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,360
somebody's written down a lot of these

462
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,559
little fragments or they've put all the

463
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,120
pieces in and I wanted to see not just

464
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,080
were any of these little fragments there

465
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,159
but at this point are any pieces quoting

466
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,000
or copying from or plagiarizing from

467
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:52,200
anybody else's music so what you have to

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
do is you take all the songs and you

469
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,880
compare each one of them n by n right um

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,640
sorry that's not enough we got to zoom

471
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,640
out a little bit

472
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,360
and there we go yeah so it's something

473
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,400
like that that's actually just comparing

474
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,280
each of the volumes we actually want to

475
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,720
compare each of these volumes has about

476
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,679
150 pieces so you have to do the square

477
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,440
of the number of pieces divide by two

478
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,679
because it's symmetrical and so you have

479
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,039
about 3.1 million comparisons and that's

480
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,640
the reason why nobody had done this

481
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,880
before um I'm actually really lucky our

482
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,799
best estimates which I don't know is

483
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:33,080
that 14th century music is about

484
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:35,799
10% of the size of 15th century music

485
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:39,400
and every successive century is about

486
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,120
tenfold more music so I have algorithms

487
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,240
that I've devised that I think will also

488
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,840
work for the 15th century and maybe if I

489
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,440
ever had a huge research budget I could

490
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,320
do the 16th but it's going to be up to

491
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,880
you all to figure out what's the

492
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,240
algorithm that can compare every piece

493
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,600
of known music to every other piece and

494
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,520
get that and that's why I care a lot

495
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,960
about simil similar it so sorry I got

496
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,320
ahead of myself so with um with great

497
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,440
scholar Anna Katherine grow uh created

498
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,520
the electronic Medieval music score

499
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,679
archive project or msap uh which slides

500
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,279
a little bit out of date but back then

501
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,200
it had about 1.3 million notes now we're

502
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:21,480
close to like 1.8 million and of course

503
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,159
you know this this one right so what you

504
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,200
do is you take all the take all the

505
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,240
music and you take music 21 and then it

506
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,960
does something like this and you know

507
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,039
that's how that's how it looks when you

508
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,440
do run the

509
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,799
matches now you all know that this is

510
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,880
what you do to uh to get funding for

511
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,039
your project and that's not actually how

512
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,960
it works right only in CSI uh no the way

513
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,039
it actually works is you go and you take

514
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,000
your scans that you've done and how do

515
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,080
you get them scanned you spend all day

516
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
putting them on a scanner um and

517
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,880
then enter every one of these pieces

518
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,640
into um mostly Muse Corell finale

519
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,679
whatever it is and then we exported

520
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,480
everything as music XML some people uh

521
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,880
like there's a specific output for music

522
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,919
uh musicology called Mei which is pretty

523
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,039
similar uh but I use Music XML and so

524
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,600
then we have here's the music XML for

525
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,679
the first three first four notes of this

526
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,799
one piece called sorry I'll just jump

527
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,120
back called an Neu which is um

528
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:27,520
completely only one copy of it in the

529
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:32,200
world then uh wrote some programs python

530
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,480
music 21 um things just to take every 31

531
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,080
note little segment I don't know why I

532
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,679
ended up with 31 um and just

533
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,400
automatically chop it up so that there's

534
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,200
these um little segments things and

535
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,520
ideally you would chop it up you would

536
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,200
slide your window over one note at a

537
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,039
time but there's a trade-off between

538
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,520
getting the best um similarity and then

539
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,919
um and also not having your database EXP

540
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,480
explode with internal quotations so we

541
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,760
did this and had it go through

542
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,520
everything here and then once we had

543
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,720
chopped up the pieces into these little

544
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,159
31 note segments uh then we did uh what

545
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,120
keep was talking about a a Viewpoint or

546
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,159
a hash or an encoding system to try to

547
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,000
reduce the complexity of it so the

548
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,720
complexity the system that I used you're

549
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,640
going to kind of laugh at um if a note

550
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,880
was the same duration as the previous it

551
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,760
got the asky letter A B CDE e f g I

552
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,840
dropped Sharps and flats because

553
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,039
different copies of the same piece in

554
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,840
the middle ages sometimes write it as B

555
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,000
flat sometimes they don't write a flat

556
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,880
you're just supposed to hear that well

557
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,320
obviously there was a augmented fourth

558
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,320
I'm going to sing that flat so they

559
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,960
don't always put that in so we get rid

560
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,320
of accidentals and then if the note's

561
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,760
longer than the previous note um then we

562
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:01,480
use H through n and if it's shorter then

563
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:03,720
it's O through U so um p is a b that is

564
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,039
shorter than the previous note you just

565
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,360
go through and put everything in like

566
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,440
that and the first note I always just

567
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,039
assume it's the same so we take all of

568
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,720
these things and put it into a giant

569
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:21,480
database um it's not that big it's about

570
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,480
188,000 of these little segments at that

571
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,320
time and so this is the segment for the

572
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,919
opening of Ana it's kind of I always

573
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,880
think it's kind of unceremoniously

574
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,799
stored there like the arc at the end of

575
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,320
the Indiana Jones film if you've ever

576
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,240
seen it just can't really tell where it

577
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,240
is so then we have to compare every one

578
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,000
of these

579
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,600
188,000 sequences against every other

580
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,760
one so we take the first one the Anan

581
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,120
Neu Melody and just some random other

582
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,080
one and we can figure out what are all

583
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,679
the things we have to do in um earth

584
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,679
mover leein or some other distance thing

585
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,200
in order to transform the first one to

586
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,799
the second one so you have to well you

587
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,960
insert a whole bunch of things and then

588
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:12,080
some things the same delete whatever and

589
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,200
the end you get a ratio from 0o to one

590
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,039
of how similar they are I always like to

591
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,559
store float uh store integers um in

592
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,840
databases it saves a lot of space so I

593
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,080
just multiply by 10,000 so I get a

594
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,760
number between 0 and 10,000 to store

595
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,840
these ones are 177% similar these are

596
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,760
actually a

597
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,760
surprisingly bad amount of similarity

598
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,520
random pieces tend to be uh more similar

599
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,360
but so this this is not a match right

600
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,559
nobody's going to say that those that

601
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,480
those two lines are the same piece

602
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,399
slightly different

603
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:52,440
no um but that's okay because we do it

604
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:56,080
188,000 by 188,000 times or 35 billion

605
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,760
divide by two since it's symmetrical 16

606
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,399
billion 18 billion right um

607
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,440
yeah but then I went through and stored

608
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,760
every single time there was something

609
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,240
that was more than 50% similar so

610
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,640
there's two IDs and the ratio of how

611
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,159
similar they are and over 50% similar

612
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,200
ended up with 814,000 things I'm never

613
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,279
going to look at those that's just way

614
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,120
too many so I started going to at around

615
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,799
65% similar I started to suspect these

616
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,279
tended to be pieces um by the same

617
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,840
composer or uh quite often if we knew or

618
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,200
I suspected they would be or something

619
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,080
like that at 70% similar you're like wow

620
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,159
these aren't the same piece but they're

621
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:44,600
they're a lot like it but at definitely

622
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,399
at over 80% similar um they're always

623
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,720
the same piece and how can something be

624
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,480
the same piece and be 20% off it could

625
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,399
just be that they were sliced at

626
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,840
different points so they're the exact

627
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:58,279
same thing but the but the first third

628
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:01,240
of one segment is in some other one okay

629
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:03,360
okay so this is what the actual um

630
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,919
workflow looks like I used to use

631
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,279
Eclipse um and just running through all

632
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,279
these pieces and occasionally it finds a

633
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,679
match and it puts it up and I get to see

634
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,919
okay does that look like that or yeah

635
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,760
that one kind of looks like that one um

636
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,640
and sometimes we already knew them the

637
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,760
computer does not read uh what pieces we

638
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,360
already knew were quoted but we ended up

639
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,760
with some interesting things this is a

640
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,640
piece by a guy named johanes this is

641
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,240
unpublished yet don't don't put it all

642
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,159
over everywhere um a guy the name of um

643
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,559
johanes jonia one of the most important

644
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,039
composes around 1400 and one of his

645
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:45,240
pieces it's a part of the mass p poent

646
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:49,799
and it turns out that a big chunk of it

647
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,399
was taken from an unknown uh sort of uh

648
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,230
an anonymous never recorded by anybody

649
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,000
German

650
00:27:53,230 --> 00:28:00,120
[Music]

651
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,120
song Let me see if I can do the

652
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,960
here we are if you've never

653
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,760
read so we can find that there was a lot

654
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,720
more copying than we ever expected um

655
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,039
this one of my favorites here's a a

656
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,720
French piece and Italian piece nobody

657
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,679
ever suspected they had anything in

658
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,360
common because whoever and I don't know

659
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,799
which direction the coping happened

660
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,640
whoever did the coping did a good chance

661
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:40,200
of covering their tracks the colored

662
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,960
Parts represent the same music okay and

663
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,519
then down here stole something from up

664
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,679
there and then up here we stole

665
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:51,720
something from over there and so on so

666
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,279
it's just two that are pastiches of each

667
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,279
other and then if this were a musicology

668
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:59,039
class people would actually care about

669
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:01,440
which one this um what all these other

670
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,640
things but eventually we got to start

671
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,760
reading these erased pieces and figuring

672
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:12,159
out where they came from

673
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,200
so that's the big reason why I created

674
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,880
Music 21 and why you will find that

675
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,519
there are lots of weird little things uh

676
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,039
that are only useful for music uh for

677
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:27,519
Medieval music hidden around deep inside

678
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:29,279
the various um libraries and stuff so

679
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,640
that's what I do when I'm not um

680
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:37,760
enjoying in being in your company any

681
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,760
questions or anything you want to see

682
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,919
again there are by the way U lots of

683
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,399
places do want um historians who can do

684
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,760
this type of work so if you're all

685
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,200
interested Humanities in general but

686
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,480
you're like but you know I also want to

687
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,440
program and stuff people are are dying

688
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,960
for things like that yeah question so

689
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,159
like what made you want to expand

690
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,559
music uh you all uh your predecessors

691
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,799
people for about 10 15 years before you

692
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,320
from here at MIT it just felt like you

693
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:15,399
know people wanted to uh do interesting

694
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,679
things with composition with analysis uh

695
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:22,880
everybody wanted to uh solve their first

696
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,399
year Theory uh homework by computer um

697
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,960
and why not if you can program the

698
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,440
computer to do it and it's not uh you

699
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,760
know complete Black AI you're probably

700
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,039
teaching yourself how to do it better

701
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,799
also so it was it was things things like

702
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:39,440
that and of over time I've taken out a

703
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,240
lot of the most egregious that only a

704
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,559
person working on 14th century Italy

705
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,519
would um would want to do this and put

706
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,120
this in a separate project so there's no

707
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,720
longer an automatic U change medieval

708
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,480
notation into modern notation tool you

709
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,360
have to install that separately but yeah

710
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,360
um I just just felt like I was having

711
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,320
too much fun and other people wanted to

712
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,240
share in it and that meant eventually

713
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,440
docs would have to happen and uh then a

714
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,960
very generous uh funding organization

715
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,279
called The sver Institute selected music

716
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,559
21 to be uh one of MIT mit's

717
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:16,799
representative project for their funding

718
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,559
Organization for three years and that

719
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,639
allowed me to do a little bit more than

720
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:24,600
one person can do at their desk and now

721
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,960
the thing that helps me do more than one

722
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,760
person can do at the desk is community

723
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,799
of a lot of people who keep adding to it

724
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,639
um and doing cool things with it so

725
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,760
thanks other

726
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:43,399
cues why is it called music 21 uh course

727
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:46,559
21 M I wanted something that um that

728
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:49,639
would connected itself to MIT in some

729
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,080
way but wasn't uh MIT music because your

730
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,440
trademark office would probably uh get

731
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,519
against me and also I was a second-year

732
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,279
professor without tenure so I might have

733
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,600
been denied tenure and needed to able to

734
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:02,919
take it with me if I went someplace else

735
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,480
but yeah so and then somebody later was

736
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,120
like oh it's the thing for the 21st

737
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,440
century I said I I actually never

738
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,440
thought of that connotation if I had

739
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,600
there's no way I would have called it 21

740
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,200
because that sounds very a arrogant and

741
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,720
be um a little obsolete in 2006 when

742
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,480
you're already in the 21st century it's

743
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,720
perfect for 1980 or something

744
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,840
yeah what was it called before music uh

745
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,440
it was called um uh P music first for

746
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,279
Pearl music when I was writing it in

747
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,000
Pearl and then uh the fact then as soon

748
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:39,200
as um the intro to CS class switched

749
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,600
from your older language scheme to

750
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,320
python I was like well if if all of MIT

751
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,039
is going to move to a new language at

752
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,000
the same time then um you know it it'll

753
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,799
be easier for me to learn a new language

754
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,120
than to have uh the rest of my life

755
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,880
teach my students how to program in

756
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,039
Pearl and I'm very glad I

757
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,120
did uh the other thing is the work on it

758
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,600
I sort of began in 2004 but work really

759
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,440
began around

760
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,279
2006 and at the time I predicted that it

761
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,399
would have a 20year lifespan that it

762
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,159
would be sort

763
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:19,159
of five or six years of um of getting

764
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,279
people to notice it and start using it

765
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:24,600
seven or eight years of it being the

766
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,880
main thing out there and um five to

767
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,200
seven years of you know the decline

768
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,720
while something else better came out and

769
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,919
I'm still looking for that say better

770
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,240
you guys can do that it's about there's

771
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,840
there are things we've learned from

772
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,679
using it that um I think are have have

773
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,760
made realize that there's some pretty

774
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,279
poor design decisions such as having to

775
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,480
copy everything all the time and things

776
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,480
like that and so um I would you know I'd

777
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,159
really love it if somebody else would um

778
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,880
would create something new and better so

779
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,240
whoever's here or watching it uh you

780
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,120
have my blessing to try to try to knock

781
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,840
this off its shelf and maybe the new

782
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,280
thing will have a lot of uh machine

783
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,760
learning built in or something to be

784
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,159
able to do better analysis yeah but

785
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,520
Python's been enduring a lot longer than

786
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:21,159
I thought it would be I mean it's sort

787
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:24,040
of been 15 years as as a major language

788
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,040
and it seems to be still growing so that

789
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,800
probably will stop Julia's next Julia's

790
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,919
next that's people have been saying that

791
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,200
about Julia and R for there is a Julia

792
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:36,079
Port of Music 21 if you like that I

793
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,320
don't know how how good it works so

794
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,440
that's a perfect transition oh we can we

795
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,399
uh we can keep going more to a second

796
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,280
topic so for this one get out your

797
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,560
laptops we're going to have um because I

798
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,919
couldn't have scripted a better

799
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:53,800
transition to um okay so now more grab

800
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,960
bag and these are more requested from

801
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,160
previous years than anything sorry I

802
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,400
can't stand all that dust

803
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,400
um oops did pushing all this shut it

804
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,000
down no here we

805
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:13,680
go okay so here are some of the things

806
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,079
go ahead and um go to this website M21

807
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,359
sand 2 if you leave off the two you get

808
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,000
to use uh a three-year-old version of

809
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,359
this you should be seeing something that

810
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,240
looks a bit like this when you get

811
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,640
there 21m

812
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,359
21 M21 sand 2

813
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,480
M21

814
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,480
sand 2 sandbox the place where you play

815
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,359
around so the thing I've always hated

816
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,319
most about music 21 is that um you can't

817
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:55,040
see anything uh that's two things you

818
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:57,440
can't see anything you can't hear

819
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,359
anything unless you you know we didn't

820
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,599
even even have uh Jupiter notebooks or

821
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,480
something back then so we didn't have

822
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,560
that and number three it's so hard to

823
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,560
install um that's getting easier but

824
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,960
still so I thought that something where

825
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,720
people can start playing with it

826
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,880
immediately online would work and so

827
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,240
I've been working on um sort of in

828
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:21,119
parallel for the past six years um

829
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,599
there's a typescript or JavaScript Port

830
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,040
who who has done JavaScript here in some

831
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,680
ways about about okay a little bit more

832
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,480
than half things so the big difference

833
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,520
in uh if you're new to JavaScript is

834
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,240
that you're going to put new in front of

835
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,960
anytime you want to instantiate

836
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,040
something and I've imported music 21

837
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,240
without importing all of the things so

838
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,839
you're going to have to type that quite

839
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,240
a bit um but what's kind of nice is you

840
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,800
can go through and change a note and

841
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,760
immediately see the stream there or um

842
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,680
octave things like that or put

843
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,599
everything down what happens if we put

844
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,920
everything down here doesn't it

845
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,839
automatically giv me a good cluff no

846
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,560
it's did I put it in okay well we can

847
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:12,280
put in a proper cluff s so we'll pend to

848
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,280
the stream a new music21 docf dobas

849
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:18,240
cff and now we can see our notes again

850
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:22,440
and uh by default if you click the

851
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,440
thing by default

852
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,440
there we go okay well I've lost all my

853
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,480
changes but you can kind of see and so

854
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,800
um some of the things you can do create

855
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,599
interactive little systems where you're

856
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,160
scrolling things up and down where

857
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,400
you're hearing um everything but it's

858
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,599
still a absolutely a work in progress so

859
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,720
if you do

860
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:52,280
analyze key you get analyze is not a

861
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,520
function so there's still a lot of

862
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,560
things um missing there but there's

863
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,000
something really nice to being able to

864
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,880
manipulate with scores in a browser

865
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,960
stuff the Alternatives that people are

866
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,200
doing right now um tend to be about

867
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,880
actually uh using HTML elements to

868
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,800
represent notes now that you have custom

869
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,160
elements and that lets you use your

870
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,720
browsers builtin um get Elements by

871
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,359
class and all these things to move

872
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,119
around a score and in theory it should

873
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,160
be uh substantially faster than this or

874
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,119
at least more

875
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,880
powerful I know if anybody wants to you

876
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,200
can play around with with any of this

877
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,400
for a little bit you can make this a

878
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,880
dotted

879
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,520
quarter what I hate is uh duration dot

880
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,160
dots equals one and nothing's going to

881
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,079
happen until I get rid of this analyze

882
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:52,680
thing here yep play the round give it a

883
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:56,240
78 78 time signature and then um here

884
00:38:52,680 --> 00:39:00,920
let's let's do this let's create P

885
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,400
equals stream dot part oops I'm totally

886
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,400
in yeah like just being in this class

887
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,720
with you all I can't not be in Python

888
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,720
mode so I'm just going to keep typing

889
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,440
Python and then correcting it to

890
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,119
JavaScript until it runs but uh we can

891
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,119
do something like

892
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:26,119
for uh let I equals

893
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:29,640
z i is less than four i++ and then oh

894
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:32,480
this pains me as a python

895
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,040
um uh as a python person to not have

896
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,960
indented code but

897
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,560
um actually do we have to call that um

898
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,880
we have to call that a measure music 21j

899
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,240
is a lot more strict about such things

900
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,240
to

901
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,839
I H what did I do

902
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,560
wrong so hard to tell without

903
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,839
indentations but there's this edit

904
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,839
doesn't allow me to hit tab to indent

905
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,280
things here always make your life easier

906
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,000
get rid of that so you can see

907
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,000
everything on one

908
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,599
page anybody know what I'm M typing here

909
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,160
I have a fully baked version over here

910
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,160
somewhere on another

911
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,119
tab here we'll go over to the the fully

912
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,119
baked one that already works so you can

913
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,040
kind

914
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:39,000
of play around with it just saying first

915
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:43,440
note of each of each measure will be a

916
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,720
random number and as we go through we'll

917
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,720
just change them and if I make any

918
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,960
changes here it will automatically give

919
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,200
me a new random number I thought I had

920
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,880
it oh

921
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,640
this here I think I have to copy and

922
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,040
paste

923
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,119
what I think happens is

924
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:09,640
um there we

925
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,640
go and you can do overlapping

926
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,440
things anyhow so it be kind of fun for a

927
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,839
live coding environment if you don't

928
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,000
care about the quality of the music um

929
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,720
coming if you don't care about the

930
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,440
quality of the sound cuz it's not really

931
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,280
optimized for sound quality uh but you

932
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,839
could put it out through other

933
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,760
things uh let grab bag topic number one

934
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,520
how to do interactive um how to do

935
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,920
interactive programming stuff you can do

936
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,760
everything uh sorry John you just came

937
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,000
back in and I'm going just just say look

938
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,520
you're the only one has anyone else

939
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,079
taken interactive music

940
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,000
systems oh you are okay so you have yeah

941
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,400
so you can put everything into uh a you

942
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,800
guys mostly use Ki right as your as your

943
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,880
toolkit so you there are things you can

944
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,200
do on the on the python side they

945
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,920
connect up music 21 to things to uh get

946
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,520
better sounding interactive um things

947
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,000
but I often find sometimes just the

948
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,319
easiest little thing U can be all you

949
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,960
need okay close these things because

950
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:17,960
otherwise it will eventually just start

951
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,839
playing again and we have just enough

952
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,079
time for I think for one more topic and

953
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,160
then uh I might finally keep my promise

954
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,920
and let you all go a little bit earlier

955
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,400
um okay so the last thing I want to talk

956
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,920
about a little bit is music

957
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,680
visualization and uh we're going to

958
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,240
listen to a piece of music by a

959
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,760
contemporary Estonian composer arvo

960
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,760
parot and I'm going to ask you

961
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,960
afterwards to say something about the

962
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,200
structure or the form of this piece and

963
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,599
how it works musically first it's a a

964
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,800
piece for choir and so it has a text

965
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,920
it's a actually high high medieval today

966
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,480
uh it's based on a Gregorian chant of

967
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,119
it's sung in German translation uh o

968
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,119
Immanuel

969
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,520
and uh the German text is going to be

970
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,720
slightly important for that so it's

971
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,280
about a TW minute piece um and long time

972
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:23,599
of the year for doing it but get

973
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,599
that here we go

974
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:38,119
[Music]

975
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:02,000
1988 I think was um one of my favorites

976
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:06,079
um anybody catch anything about the

977
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:11,559
structure you have seen the entire score

978
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:13,760
every single note so we can get

979
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,000
something yeah measures always switch

980
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,440
between 1 two and 32 measures always

981
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,559
switch between one two and 32 one two

982
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,559
and

983
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,040
32 how many sections did the piece have

984
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,200
yeah tell like three seconds nice that's

985
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,599
actually correct how many people knew

986
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,599
that and how many people were like me

987
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,440
when they heard this like once twice

988
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:45,960
three times and didn't fully catch the

989
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:50,200
structure I was yeah yeah

990
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:52,920
so fantastic fantastic usually uh so

991
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,480
yeah there some things in and what voice

992
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,319
is most Mel what two voices were most

993
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,319
melodically active

994
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:05,520
yeah middle two I think good ear good

995
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:06,960
ear this this yall are are really

996
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,599
getting you we should have been doing

997
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,200
more music analysis in class because

998
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,160
you're getting a lot of things I thought

999
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,680
were going to be extremely hard and some

1000
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,920
at least throughout the room we've had

1001
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,880
correct answers but I want to uh spend a

1002
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,640
little bit of time on music um visual by

1003
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,400
the way there are a few uh ad almost

1004
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,680
exactly there's one measure of 52

1005
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,440
but yeah there's a couple other things

1006
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,920
but yep so um are we up there yeah go

1007
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,920
ahead and download um there is the MXL

1008
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,960
the XML file music XML file of this

1009
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,880
piece on canvas and uh take a minute

1010
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,599
it's it's under copyright but I'm going

1011
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,520
to assert a claim of fair use for us to

1012
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,640
be able to uh analyze with it show

1013
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,200
should show you the just the first page

1014
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:00,000
if you're in Jupiter and

1015
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,000
more than that if you're

1016
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,079
not so this might uh some of these

1017
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:15,599
things might be helpful for

1018
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:18,160
um or what we're doing so a little bit

1019
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,839
more we're going to be going through the

1020
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:25,240
various

1021
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:25,240
um ways of visualizing

1022
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,559
I don't think we've maybe I've done a

1023
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,599
tiny bit of visualization but mostly

1024
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,599
just on slides I don't think I've

1025
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,880
shown we feeling in a good place to move

1026
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:52,640
on now okay so um you know we can do all

1027
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,920
the things that um that we normally

1028
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,079
would do we can get the key of the piece

1029
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,200
which I believe

1030
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:05,640
changes quite a bit I think if we do U

1031
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:09,000
measures 1 through 20. analyze key we

1032
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:12,400
get something very different no we

1033
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,160
don't still get interesting just the key

1034
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,839
signature changes um okay but now we'll

1035
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,839
get into some visualization things so

1036
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:23,720
the easiest thing you can do with a

1037
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:27,920
stream um is to do something called plot

1038
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:31,720
and plot just gives you um any whatever

1039
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,960
you uh sort of a standard

1040
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,640
readymade um

1041
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,760
oops that's why I never do this here uh

1042
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,079
sort of

1043
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,119
readymade image sorry it doesn't Zoom

1044
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,480
the image in but you on here but you

1045
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,480
might be able to see something like that

1046
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:51,160
and so you can see a

1047
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:55,319
relationship of the um various parts

1048
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:58,319
colored in different colors and which

1049
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:01,400
ones are singing

1050
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,920
what so here the three-part the

1051
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,240
three-fold relationship sorry I'm going

1052
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,960
to have to zoom this out tiny bit so we

1053
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:12,319
can see this again

1054
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,040
um the three-part relation three section

1055
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,520
relationship of the piece becomes very

1056
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,040
clear right you can see that something

1057
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,800
happens at the

1058
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:25,319
beginning this increase up here up until

1059
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,520
a certain point and then a lot of things

1060
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:31,720
change so what

1061
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,720
measure does the third section begin

1062
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:42,720
on yeah somewhere around there so you

1063
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:45,119
can uh 45 I think some 46 44 45 so you

1064
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,359
can kind of see something substantial

1065
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:51,760
changes and um here's what Jason pointed

1066
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:54,760
out right that um that the inner voices

1067
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,480
in the second and third sections are the

1068
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:01,000
ones that are

1069
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,079
very um very

1070
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,359
active right so where does second

1071
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,200
section begin measure

1072
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:13,839
13 to

1073
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:20,359
measure 45 so let's let's get this SEC 2

1074
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:26,119
equals arvo do measures let say 14 to 45

1075
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:27,839
44 we'll say SEC 2. plot I think I think

1076
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:29,720
the default is piano roll because that's

1077
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,760
what most people want so we can look at

1078
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,680
section

1079
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,440
two and we'll say section three was

1080
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:41,760
measures what 45 to

1081
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,440
76 Section 3 equals arvo

1082
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,440
dot

1083
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:50,160
measures 45 to

1084
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,160
76 we can plot

1085
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,760
that there's a lot of similarities here

1086
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,319
between section

1087
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,319
two and section

1088
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:11,280
3 what's what's the biggest difference

1089
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,160
musically that you can tell from these

1090
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,559
charts between section two and section

1091
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,119
three you'll probably want to go all the

1092
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:19,119
way back up to your bigger

1093
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,359
role over here this side's been mostly

1094
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:30,319
quiet yeah section two section almost

1095
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,960
identical but section two is up section

1096
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,880
two and section 3 are almost identical

1097
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:37,720
but section two is up good can we figure

1098
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,400
out about how much up it

1099
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:44,920
is look at the key on the

1100
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:48,160
side yeah the e to the A and the E to an

1101
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:51,000
A so it's about about a fifth off in a

1102
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:54,000
lot of things except for on the extremes

1103
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
but what about the notes in

1104
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,559
between these moving parts

1105
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,280
where are they off what's the

1106
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,280
relationship

1107
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:14,599
there OCT yeah about yeah an OCT exactly

1108
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:18,480
an octave up so we have things moving

1109
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:20,839
now go I'll open up the score one more

1110
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,760
time I know I why I wanted the score

1111
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:28,200
open so I could keep going to back to

1112
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:32,400
this um let me get a no here we go um so

1113
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:35,040
I'll put this in front for a second

1114
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,960
and sorry now i' now I've lost my my

1115
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:42,799
train train of thought

1116
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:45,520
um how easy is it to see which parts are

1117
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:47,079
static and which parts are Mo in Motion

1118
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,680
in

1119
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:52,839
this quite a bit harder so what it what

1120
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,160
kind of motion is happening we've

1121
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:57,839
identified that it's the inner voices

1122
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,079
that are in motion

1123
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,240
um what's the

1124
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,200
pattern now go back to your

1125
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,200
visualization and see if you can figure

1126
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,160
it

1127
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,160
out in any of the inner

1128
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,040
voices maybe it's easier if you just

1129
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,880
look at one of the sections so you can

1130
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,000
zoom in a little bit

1131
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,920
more John do you want

1132
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
to move in

1133
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,920
parall they move in parallel first yeah

1134
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,040
and looks good and within any given

1135
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,040
voice what's the what's it

1136
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:38,520
doing is it playing Mary had a little

1137
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:41,880
lamp is it jumping around a huge uh

1138
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:44,040
octave and then coming back down

1139
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,480
Adam they're just playing the same note

1140
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,960
uh not all of them are playing the same

1141
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,280
note these ones are playing the same

1142
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,559
note right but what what's what are the

1143
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,880
other voices doing these inner

1144
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,400
voices do it go all the way up and then

1145
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,960
all the way yeah I you s repeating right

1146
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,400
they're repeating what what do they do

1147
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,119
what what's the pattern yeah stepwise

1148
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,040
stepwise good it's all stepwise which is

1149
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,440
the hard part about piano roll right you

1150
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,359
would want a dionic piano roll at some

1151
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:15,839
point um I think we have that somewhere

1152
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:18,000
um and it's all step wise and it's even

1153
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:21,440
more than that yeah go Vin it nebor

1154
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,680
tones around a certain page top around

1155
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,440
they're all neighbor tones around a

1156
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,160
certain pitch yeah so you can kind of

1157
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:30,480
top one I can't reach so we'll do the

1158
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,760
middle one is I guess around e and is it

1159
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,520
is there a pattern that you do three ups

1160
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:39,680
and then a down and then what is

1161
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:43,640
it up then down up then down up then

1162
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:46,839
down so you could almost have a formula

1163
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:50,799
um with this in fact uh the the one of

1164
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:53,559
the um other python based music um

1165
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:55,960
packages which is more about creating

1166
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:59,559
algorithmically generable music is

1167
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,359
called arvo based on arvo parr's um

1168
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:04,880
ability to do this so you can you can

1169
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:06,720
download install arvo and um it makes it

1170
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,520
much easier than music 21 does to

1171
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,240
generate uh here's a motive now spin it

1172
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,520
out over a certain amount of time while

1173
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,799
doing something else so yeah so we have

1174
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,200
this thing going up and down and up and

1175
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:20,680
down and things like that um by the way

1176
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,160
some of the other interesting things

1177
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,359
about the piece that we're not going to

1178
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:29,839
visualize music 21 uh are um when does

1179
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:33,240
it uh change notes on on any multi-

1180
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:37,280
syllable accented German word which I

1181
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:40,680
think uh sort of interesting here so the

1182
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:43,160
accent always gets the gets the whole

1183
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,799
note and it's always the opposite of

1184
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,400
whatever it was

1185
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:51,000
before and then you can kind of see well

1186
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,760
in section two all of the voices kind of

1187
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,079
play at once and they all rest at once

1188
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,640
but in section three the top and the

1189
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,200
bottom ones only coming in certain times

1190
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,280
the visualization of this helped me in

1191
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,960
figuring out well when are those times

1192
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,920
and it turns out also very strictly

1193
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:13,079
generated um that it is

1194
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,599
just every other word

1195
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,480
do they do that's two

1196
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:22,920
words we don't

1197
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,319
sing next two words derer we sing Oh

1198
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,520
Come we

1199
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,880
don't and there's one exception to it uh

1200
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,359
no sorry there isn't an exception on

1201
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,640
this one there's some someplace else is

1202
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,880
an exception on things but I think

1203
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,240
probably set up so that just the number

1204
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,200
of words makes it so that God stands

1205
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:44,599
alone at the end without accompanyment

1206
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:47,559
so interesting piece now let's do a tiny

1207
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:52,440
bit more analysis on it

1208
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:55,359
um there's a plot that um I could call

1209
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,559
this a cook plot cook because I saw this

1210
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:00,400
in now in the reading for Nicholas cook

1211
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,280
um article on computational and

1212
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,880
comparative

1213
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,640
music computational and comparative

1214
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,200
musicology I first saw this in a book by

1215
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:13,760
em uh somebody named Emily Dolan so I

1216
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:17,720
call it a Dolan graph um even though um

1217
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:21,720
and it shows you who is singing where at

1218
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:24,240
what point which parts are performing

1219
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,000
and do you remember this from the cook

1220
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,680
it's slightly different graph that he

1221
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,599
had a slightly different shape size but

1222
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,799
same type of thing what's being uh

1223
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,799
depicted

1224
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:37,799
here take a guess what's that Dynamic

1225
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:39,880
Dynamics yeah so it's a sort of who's

1226
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:42,000
playing when and what are the Dynamics

1227
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,400
and if you zoom in really closely you

1228
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,720
can see that soprano is always singing a

1229
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,640
tiny bit before the other parts but yeah

1230
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:54,079
so the piece just sort of builds up to

1231
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:58,799
about two3 point then drops off and just

1232
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:02,400
very quiet everything after after that

1233
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:05,319
um so there's quite often I think for

1234
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,200
people who can read music notation uh

1235
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:10,520
graphs and plotting visualization isn't

1236
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,400
too much of a help but for getting a

1237
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,760
sense of the form of a large piece very

1238
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:20,400
quickly these um these tools can be very

1239
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,440
very helpful uh we can kind of see what

1240
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,760
what notes does he use the most well

1241
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,640
obviously those that are going to be um

1242
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,640
that that the sustained notes are going

1243
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:35,640
to come quite a bit but we can

1244
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:39,319
see that of the various pitch classes

1245
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,480
basically there's a reason why it was

1246
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:43,799
coming out as a

1247
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:50,640
major as our

1248
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:50,640
analysis as a definitely winning e

1249
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,920
c but almost I guess every surprisingly

1250
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:00,280
for a piece that sounds so um consonant

1251
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:05,079
in many ways every pitch class is

1252
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:07,359
represented at least once there

1253
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:09,799
um let me see which I have a whole bunch

1254
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:15,440
of ones that are maybe a little bit less

1255
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:19,160
interesting but um we can look at the um

1256
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,839
certain pitches use different uh quarter

1257
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:24,359
different notes more so we can plot a

1258
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:28,280
scatter plot and then what we haven't

1259
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:33,200
seen yet is the second and third element

1260
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:37,480
uh here um is quarter

1261
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,480
length versus

1262
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,880
pitch I think there's other things you

1263
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,799
can do you can plot around with octave

1264
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,359
and stuff so these are plot gives you a

1265
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:56,119
ready made take in a score and get get

1266
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,480
some kind of analysis there's two

1267
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,200
slightly lower level things if you want

1268
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,480
to if you're thinking of doing

1269
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,119
visualization in there one call it the

1270
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:08,720
graph which is underlying the plot which

1271
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,200
is the um what you're trying to do and

1272
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,440
what data you want to extract so it's

1273
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,520
sort of a feature extraction again and

1274
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,640
what do you want to put on each axis so

1275
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:21,760
there's axes that are defined that you

1276
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:23,720
can I don't know we can do let's plot um

1277
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,720
Pitch against

1278
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:30,119
Dynamic you know what I yeah

1279
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,119
Dynamics does that

1280
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:43,440
work you know what who puts pitch on the

1281
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:47,640
xaxis we'll put Pitch on the Y AIS

1282
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:51,480
versus Dynamics swap that

1283
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,480
around that's why it's having so

1284
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:58,039
trouble so you can see that the oops

1285
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:07,280
that the lowest notes in the pieces only

1286
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:11,400
appear on um on the quietest things and

1287
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:14,079
kind of also look at this terrorist um

1288
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:18,200
initial motion of the piece as the notes

1289
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:20,559
were going up and um and both going up

1290
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:24,079
in pitch and getting higher in volume

1291
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:26,000
and then the very highest um volumes are

1292
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,799
scattered all all throughout but every

1293
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,280
everything down here shifted up a little

1294
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:35,280
bit um just as we

1295
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,799
saw think the best thing to do would be

1296
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,119
now that we've thought about the piece

1297
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:43,880
thought about its structure listen to it

1298
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:47,400
one more time um maybe with the we'll

1299
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:49,200
listen to it with the um piano roll and

1300
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,760
see if

1301
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:56,119
um see if we

1302
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:59,000
can oops not that one the the big one

1303
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:02,720
and see if we can hear the various parts

1304
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,079
of the piece just as well as we could on

1305
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,599
um with the

1306
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:09,240
score words are harder to tell there's

1307
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:09,240
no plot for

1308
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:15,440
that you're mostly color blind Professor

1309
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,720
just realized that I used a version of

1310
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,359
the plot that does colors not based on

1311
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,240
the part but just um as a way of being

1312
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,799
able to see which pitches are which so I

1313
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,440
apologize I made a mistake and said you

1314
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:30,880
could can tell the lines by color but uh

1315
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,480
I have to strain to see color so so

1316
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,359
sorry about U about that but I did just

1317
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,799
while listening to it make one

1318
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,799
observation this interesting line that

1319
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:43,400
the E is the very first thing that you

1320
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:46,000
hear and it just after a little absence

1321
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:49,119
comes back and it's one of the few lines

1322
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,559
that's so preminent prominent throughout

1323
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:56,720
there so maybe maybe e is the true sort

1324
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,720
of root point of this piece

1325
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,920
well thanks everybody um for going

1326
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,960
through grab bag if you I have more

1327
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,720
topics that are interest to me but

1328
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,720
anything that's interest to you let me

1329
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,720
know
