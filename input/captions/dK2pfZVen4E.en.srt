1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
All right. Thank you, Carrie. So, next

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,800
up we have Mark.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,199
>> Hello. I've got

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
>> Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,119
>> I'm wired.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,600
>> I need that, though.

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,279
>> Uh, good afternoon and last session of

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,480
the day, so I'll be quick because

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,560
everybody wants to get out of here,

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
right?

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,200
>> Pardon me. I have a hook.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,200
>> Excellent. Please use it. Um

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
I'm going to do a a brief overview. This

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,239
has been looked at obviously a number of

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,520
times over the last two days, but um you

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,559
know this is a a milestone project in

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,160
the USA any way you look at it. Um you

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,920
know again it's Eversource Energy, you

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,280
know the owner of it. single pipe

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,879
system, ambient loop, mile distribution,

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,559
37 or 38 buildings. I thought I heard an

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
extra building somehow got attached. I'm

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,799
not quite sure how that worked. That's

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,799
fine. Um there's commercial buildings

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
and there's residential buildings. So

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,600
your upside there is you've got good

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,439
diversity. Um they're all single family

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
homes. A district loop would not have

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
made sense. So site selection was very

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,880
important. It made sense for the

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,479
residents as well as the system itself

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,720
and the owner. Excuse me. Uh 90 vertical

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,159
bore well 90 vertical and angled bore

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,520
holes. Um so I think everyone knows that

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,920
there was two configurations. Two bore

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,479
fields were vertical and then there was

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,280
another bore field that's kind of two

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,000
bore fields that are angled. So the uh

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,600
verticals were 600 feet in depth and the

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,200
angles were 720 ft approximately with

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,360
quad loops. Quad loops what I mean is

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,920
two U bends in each bore hole.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,000
What I thought was very interesting and

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,240
looking at what was I going to be

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,520
talking about is you have some very

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,640
interesting dynamics at play here.

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,720
um have it's a unique coming together if

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,720
you think about it. Credit to Zanob Heat

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,319
being able to pursue this over all this

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,080
time and convincing a natural gas

51
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,239
utility that theoretically can't sell

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
any gas. It's kind of a interesting

53
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,879
concept when you think about it, right?

54
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,040
Um, I thought it was just absolutely

55
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,640
amazing because it it's a successful

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,680
project and you had two really very

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,239
disparit entities coming together. And

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,280
what I did want to do is have a bit of

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560
an applause for uh Zay and her team

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
because I don't think anyone's really

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,560
recognized what they did. It was

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,560
incredible.

63
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,280
when you get into some of the weeds, and

64
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,400
I won't go too far because I know how

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,480
many minutes do I have left because I

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
was overtime last time. Ah, I'm good.

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,560
All right. Uh, there's a lot that goes

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,080
into it. I mean, it's not simply a

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,760
matter of, you know, sketching out a few

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
drawings, writing up a couple

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,400
paragraphs, and we're off to the races.

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,800
There was over,200 pages of detailed

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,000
design. It's the nuts and bolts making

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
it work. And you got to hammer out the

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,040
details, otherwise you have an

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,040
unsuccessful project. So, you know,

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
approximately 37 detailed drawings. I

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,920
looked at it again and it's actually

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,920
more because they're subsets of

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,280
drawings. That said, there was, you

81
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,959
know, about 37 main ones. You go through

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,480
the process once you get into

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,840
construction of clarification questions

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,120
and submissions and approvals. And it's

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,720
not it's not a straight path to success.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
There's back and forth. There's going to

87
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080
be, you know, let's be really candid,

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
there's going to be arguments because

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,360
that's the nature of the beast. You

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,840
should be doing that. No, I'm doing

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,760
this. And sometimes there's not clarity

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,599
in the written specification. As much as

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
you want to do it, you can't take

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,360
everything into consideration. That's

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,360
kind of life.

96
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
Some of the changes, and I was exposed

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,560
to it during the process. Um, and again,

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,919
I'm not trying to beat up here on

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
anything. I want everyone just to

100
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,800
realize what some of the challenges were

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,120
during the process. So, initially the

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
bore fields, the three of them were all

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,479
in a vertical configuration.

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,720
There was a change made into the angled

105
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,680
bore holes in one of the three bore

106
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,600
fields. That in and of itself causes

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,360
some some issues understanding

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:49,600
will the angled borer field with now

109
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,000
quad loops as opposed to single Ubends

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,639
perform to the level required for the

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,600
system to operate properly and support

112
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
the building loads anticipated. So you

113
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,199
can probably imagine there was a lot of

114
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,440
back and forth. What's going on with

115
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,320
these angled bore holes? We had to

116
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,400
remodel this, remodel that. It's not

117
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,080
simple as okay, we're just going to

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,160
start angling them out. Doesn't work

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,160
that way.

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,880
Again, the the single Uband versus the

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,120
quad loop, you're looking what is the

122
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,360
capacity? What is is there an increase?

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
And if so, what's the impact on the

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
total system? Those have all got to be

125
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
calculated. And again, this is something

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,039
that doesn't happen quickly. There's a

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
lot of back and forth. There's a whole

128
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,759
hierarchy of I have a question as an

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
engineer. I'm not an engineer, but if

130
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,520
we're an engineering firm over to the um

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,240
the owner Eversource back down to a

132
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,560
contractor, there's a whole system of

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,440
checks and balances. That's also meaning

134
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,280
time consumption.

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
Um

136
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,520
what an interesting change that happened

137
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
is the North America compliant

138
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,000
collection vaults. Does everyone know

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,560
what I mean by a collection vault or am

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,479
I talking Greek here? That's where you

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,360
have a bunch of bore holes that come

142
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,479
into a collection point and that box if

143
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
you like and it's usually made from

144
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,720
highdensity polyethylene. There are

145
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,039
concrete boxes as well. They are

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,199
subterranean. They're buried and then

147
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,039
from there you have a supply and return

148
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,280
going in over to the pump house. In this

149
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:28,560
case, there was a change made between

150
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,600
the North American compliant vaults and

151
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,039
what was put in on the angled bore hole

152
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,680
vaults, a European spec. On the face of

153
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,479
it, you go, what's the difference? There

154
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,280
is. you end up with different pipe sizes

155
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,840
between a European spec, which is a DIN

156
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,680
spec, versus a North American spec,

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,280
which is in this particular case, we use

158
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,720
IPS, which is iron pipe size. Getting

159
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,280
those two to marry up sounds easy. It's

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,880
not. And it ends up being a potential

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,800
area of concern into the future. The

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,599
other last point on changes and impact,

163
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,199
those angled bore holes. Now we're going

164
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,440
under wetlands before they weren't. So

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,319
there's a whole regulatory process that

166
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,960
has to be adhered to applications,

167
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,680
approvals, etc. So back to what Nikki

168
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,000
Bruno was saying yesterday, this started

169
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,000
Zam, correct me if I'm wrong, 2019 is

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,720
when things really got moving.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,319
>> Uh the initial proposal was in the fall

172
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
2019 for the Department of Public

173
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,960
Utility

174
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
>> till today. So you can imagine one more

175
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,840
step that's going to unfortunately delay

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,160
things or potentially delay things and

177
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,440
that's the whole communication

178
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,280
um component that's vital between all

179
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
parties and is it smooth? Is it

180
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,639
confrontational? These are all things

181
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,919
you have to look at when you're doing a

182
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,400
large project like this.

183
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,440
Um you've seen the picture. That's what

184
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,919
the angled bore holes look like. Um it's

185
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,720
a proven technology. It makes a whole

186
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,240
lot of sense. You're having a very small

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,479
footprint up top at surface and then

188
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,560
those bore holes spllay out and you have

189
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,080
the separation between the bore holes so

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,039
you're not having thermal interference

191
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,039
between them. It allows at the surface

192
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,039
to have less um

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,680
impact if you like. You're not taking up

194
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,400
as much room. In this particular case,

195
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,440
the the the project didn't have to redo

196
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,719
the whole um parking lot in a repave.

197
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,080
They had a smaller area.

198
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,039
Some of the areas, and they're a little

199
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,640
hard to see, but this is the one going

200
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,440
to point it out. And you've probably

201
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,600
seen this picture here,

202
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
uh and as well as up there. Those are

203
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
the European vaults that I was talking

204
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,560
about. They are substantially different

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,560
from a North American vault. Uh,

206
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,560
that's an area of concern moving

207
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,880
forward.

208
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Um, I'm going to pick on you, Brock.

209
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,200
Those pipes, your best guess is is a

210
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,240
good idea or a bad idea on the left.

211
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,800
As far as

212
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,800
>> sounds like a traping

213
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,800
>> in comparison to a regular vault.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,640
>> I Yeah, it's unconventional for what I'm

215
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
used to seeing and just the way it's

216
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
laid out.

217
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
>> Yep. Okay. And that's that's the basic

218
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,680
consensus. People looked at this picture

219
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,160
and went, "Wow, there's some some

220
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,880
potential concerns down the road." The

221
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,360
picture on the right is where those bore

222
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,399
holes where you can see them coming up

223
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,279
here. These ones here, they're all like

224
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,120
that. They get tied together. The

225
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,959
problem with there, not problem, the

226
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,680
issue, the concern is if you look at the

227
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,040
pipe on the right, you can see some of

228
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,760
those are basically being compressed.

229
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,880
That shouldn't be happening for a

230
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,399
long-term reliability because ultimately

231
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,000
this gets backfilled, gets paved, and

232
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,640
then you can potentially, this is a

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,880
parking lot, have big trucks on top

234
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,640
pushing down, pushing down. So, it's an

235
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,120
area of concern that again in retrospect

236
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,399
may have been addressed differently.

237
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,480
That's the vault. Um,

238
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,399
they're used in Europe all the time.

239
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,880
There's nothing wrong with them. They're

240
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,959
just not North America compliant. They

241
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,839
have components inside, particularly PCV

242
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,519
plastic. Uh if anyone was here this

243
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,959
morning, the standard in North America

244
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,120
says you're not using PVC in these

245
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,079
systems, subterranean.

246
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,440
So that's the below the wetlands. Um,

247
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,880
it's not a huge issue so long as you get

248
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,680
the proper uh approvals. The wetlands

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,120
are an area of concern for everybody and

250
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,079
you have to make sure you're dotting

251
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:09,040
eyes and crossing tees.

252
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:11,040
Um, again, just a quick uh takeaways.

253
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,760
Communication is key. I mean, that's in

254
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,519
I know we've heard that repetitively.

255
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,399
it came to the forefront and this one in

256
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,480
particular when changes happened and

257
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,880
they were somewhat

258
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,120
unconventional. We'll leave it at that.

259
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,440
That change from the single U bend to

260
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,079
the double U bend again add some

261
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,959
complexity to the whole issue and from a

262
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,079
modeling and uh performance point of

263
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,279
view required a lot of redoing and then

264
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,760
the materials used um are not North

265
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,720
American compliant. Not that's the end

266
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,600
of the world. It's just to be

267
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,079
recognized.

268
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,740
That's it. I'm Oh, good. I didn't go

269
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:58,090
over time. I'm zero minutes. Perfect.

270
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,090
[Applause]
