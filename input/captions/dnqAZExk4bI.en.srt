1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,480
so um I'm from MIT professional

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:09,360
education and we partner a lot with ILP

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,679
to bring you whether it's corporate

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,679
Partnerships through education and what

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,119
we focus on is programs for engineering

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,520
and Technology

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,519
professionals uh so when you look at

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,439
folks like Philip Bola for example who

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,000
just presented he's also one of our

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,640
faculty he teaches in the machine

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,199
learning and AI professional certificate

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,240
so if you like that you get a little bit

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,759
more and if you want to learn even

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,800
related things that he talked about such

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,360
as reinforcement learning this is a

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,800
great way to bring your staff we have

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,239

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,000
high potentials or people that are just

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,960
on boarding or in anywhere in between to

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,199
keep their skills up so whatever your

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,079
company goals are we work with you to

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,760

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,079
James who also teaches with us and I

46
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,680
also put in there Regina bar who leads

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,600
our machine learning and AI

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,039
certificate um the key topic areas we

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,560
focus on um other than machine learning

50
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,080
and AI biotech data science

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,520
sustainability um digital transformation

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,040
Innovation um one of the underlying

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,959
things that we offer through all of our

programs is leadership and communication

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,800
um many Engineers may not have had uh a

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,720
lot of leadership training but as that

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,560
now this CH is really changing um so we

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,040
provide that as every part of our

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,080
programs is offering engineering leaders

60
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,760
ship whether it's persuasive

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,040
communication um effective communication

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,800
