I'm Cara Miller. And I'm Rob Stoner. And

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,919
from the MIT Energy Initiative, this is

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,550
What If It Works, a podcast looking at

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,349
the energy solutions for climate

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,349
[Music]

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,320
change. Today, we're going to examine an

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,199
energy source with huge potential to

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,560
shape the future, but one that's not

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,000
without some complications. Hydrogen.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
And let's start with a little story

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,840
about hydrogen and how its power can

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,600
kind of creep up on you. The story takes

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,000
place in the late 1980s in Mali in West

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,840
Africa. Okay, so the Molly story is

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,480
really an interesting one. This well

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,399
that was being done to find water and

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
they got down to about 100 meters. They

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
didn't find water, but they noticed that

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,640
there was wind blowing out of the well.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,879
That's Brad Hager, a professor of Earth,

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,160
atmospheric, and planetary sciences at

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,160
MIT. He's also the associate director of

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,640
the Earth Resources Lab. So, as usual,

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,640
they uh sat down for a break to ponder

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,520
the situation. The crew member lit up a

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,360
cigarette and kaboom uh this big blue

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,479
flame shoots out. He was burned.

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,479
Fortunately, he he recovered and it

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,600
continued to burn in this bright blue

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,439
flame for several weeks. So, they had to

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,840
figure out how to cap the well. And, you

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,520
know, capping wells is is a little bit

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
tricky. And especially in Mali, they

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,880
didn't have the expertise to do it, but

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,119
it burned for several weeks and finally

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,159
they capped it. So what was the

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,479
importance of this big blue flame? Well,

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,759
no one explored it for a while. Hager

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:44,159
says the well just sat there for 15

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,079
years. And a local entrepreneur decided

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,119
that he would invest in a lot of parts

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,880
of the Molly economy. And he he invested

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,399
in a Loudcat oil and gas company. And so

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,640
they decided they'd find out what was in

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,759
the well. They took a sample and they

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,719
found out it was 98% pure hydrogen. Now,

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,040
this was a pretty amazing find, but

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,040
Hager says there just wasn't the

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
infrastructure to transport the

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,440
hydrogen. The only thing they could

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,599
figure out to do with it was to run it a

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,080
generator. So, they got an old Ford uh

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,400
motor and hooked it up to a generator.

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,319
They now produce electricity uh for the

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
local village because they can't go

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,400
anywhere. You know, this is very

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,959
exciting. The equivalent amount of

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
energy that's produced in this well is

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,920
uh about three barrels of oil equivalent

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
each day, which is about 120 gallons of

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,760
of gasoline. So, you can think 120

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,160
gallons a day, you can run a pretty big

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,959
generator for a village, but but that's

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,560
about all you can do. Plus, Molly is

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
politically unstable. There have been

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,519
three coups since 2012 when they did

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,400
this. So, no big company's going to go

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,040
in there and try to produce this. But

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,680
the find points to hydrogen is a clean

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,840
energy source of the future. So let's

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
say we could get a lot more hydrogen out

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,680
of the ground. How would that change

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,560
things? It would be huge. So right now

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,760
we are producing about 100 million tons

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,920
of hydrogen annually to use primarily

77
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
for fertilizer manufacture. So you want

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,959
to make ammonium, you want to feed the

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,280
world, you use fertilizer made

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,080
substantially out of hydrogen. But going

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
into the future, using hydrogen to make

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,000
steel, for example, instead of using

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,959
coke would take away a tremendous amount

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,200
of the CO2. But here's the catch. You

85
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,280
don't find such concentrated sources of

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,920
hydrogen in very many places. So we do

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,480
now understand why it's there in Molly.

88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,200
And it's a very special circumstance.

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,519
There is a uh a trap very much like the

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,920
traps that hold natural gas

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
accumulations. And in this case, the the

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,200
trap is made out of a layer of

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,599
solidified magma. Underneath that magma,

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,000
there is a layer of limestone that has a

95
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,720
lot of pore space in it. And then deep

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,640
in the earth, maybe one or two

97
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,360
kilometers below that, there are some

98
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,680
very old rocks over a billion years old,

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,159
that are full of iron. And there is a

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,799
small amount of water that percolates

101
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,840
through this ironrich rock. And there's

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,320
a chemical reaction that goes on that

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,400
converts some of the minerals in this

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,280
rock to a kind of rock called

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,720
serpentanite which is the same as

106
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,600
asbestous. In doing that it takes the

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,000
water and strips off the oxygen and uses

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
that to essentially rust the iron that's

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
in the rock and leaves behind the

110
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,400
hydrogen. So over some period of time,

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,240
we don't know how long, that hydrogen

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,759
has been moving up towards the surface

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,919
and accumulating in this reservoir below

114
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
this cap rock. Brad, there's a lot of

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,160
iron down there in the Earth's crust and

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,280
a lot of water that circulates beneath

117
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,800
it as well. Uh that would imply that if

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,080
this reaction is going on between those

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,320
two things, there's an awful lot of

120
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,479
hydrogen potentially available to us.

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah, that uh that sounds great. But uh

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,120
so first of all uh the iron rich rocks

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,040
that sounds great but okay now the other

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,440
shoes going to drop go right ahead. Okay

125
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,759
so first of all the iron rich rocks uh

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
are not that common in the earth's

127
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,759
crust. Most of it we think about you

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
know silica and and other rocks but in

129
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,560
the crust there's not much iron.

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,039
Underneath Molly there is a formation

131
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,039
which is over a billion years old called

132
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,960
a greenstone belt. It's a place where

133
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,880
two continents smashed together and and

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,919
left the kind of a scar that's full of

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,600
iron rich rocks. The place where there

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
really a lot of iron rich rocks that are

137
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,280
coming up near the earth's surface are

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,400
at the extending plate boundaries at at

139
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,720
mid ocean ridges. In terms of water, we

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
have a lot of water at the surface, but

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,520
at great depth, although there's often

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,360
water, it's not often circulating very

143
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,680
much. And so, in order to run this

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,039
reaction, we need a continuous supply of

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,039
water. So, what's special about Molly is

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
that they're right at the same place uh

147
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,280
where there's this greenstone belt.

148
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,039
There are also some old fractures that

149
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
apparently are open a little bit and

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,440
there's water circulating through it.

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,840
So, there's a local source uh in Molly,

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,759
but we don't know how much is being

153
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,360
produced there. Uh all we know is that

154
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,240
it's at least some of it is being

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,240
trapped by this cap rock. So, let me

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,639
compare this to oil, which you know

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,240
people kind of have a sense of. I didn't

158
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,160
you say it's like three barrels of oil a

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,520
day coming up, right? So, if hydrogen is

160
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,280
an excellent energy source is like sort

161
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
of one of the things that's going to

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
happen or maybe already happened that

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,560
people are going to look around just

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,080
sort of they like they realize that

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,479
there was stuff in Texas but there's

166
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,919
also oil in the Dakotas but there's also

167
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,360
oil in the Peran basin. Are they going

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,520
to look around and be like so where's

169
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,199
the hydrogen like you know can we go to

170
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
Kansas and find it? So that's the

171
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,199
process that's just beginning and it's

172
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,800
very much like oil was in the 1800s.

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
People are beginning to look around and

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,199
there's a lot of effort in doing this.

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,080
The United States Geological Survey has

176
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,440
a big program to try to identify

177
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,240
hydrogen systems that are comparable to

178
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,720
petroleum systems. So what you need is

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,120
you need some source rock. In this case

180
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
it's uh water percolating through iron

181
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,479
rich rocks. You need some cap rock. In

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,400
Mali it's basalt most places it's shale

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,599
and you need a reservoir rock where the

184
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,400
hydrogen will accumulate. So right now

185
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,720
what people are doing is focusing on

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,840
where these potential source rocks might

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,360
be. So for example in the United States

188
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,479
there's an old continental rift scar

189
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,400
extending from Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa,

190
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,639
Minnesota, Michigan. There's a structure

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,479
called the mid-continental rift and

192
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,960
people right now are targeting that to

193
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,880
see if they can find hydrogen there. So,

194
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,120
are you saying like that in, you know,

195
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,080
like the upper

196
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,240
Midwest, we're looking potentially at

197
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,720
the kind

198
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,080
of I guess not gold rush exactly, but I

199
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
mean there there have been times where

200
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,840
people got really excited about

201
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,759
different sorts of energy all around the

202
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,039
country and obviously the world. Is is

203
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,479
that going to happen? And people are

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,400
going to like go there and be like, we

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,919
can get hydrogen out of the ground. It's

206
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,759
it's clean. It's a great source of

207
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,599
energy. See if we can make a bunch of

208
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,680
money here. That's exactly what people

209
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
are doing and uh both because they want

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,160
to make a lot of money and because they

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
want to save the world. So there is a

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,560
huge amount of interest right now in the

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,080
venture capital community. There's a guy

214
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
named Bill Gates who you might have

215
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,720
heard of who has dumped a substantial

216
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,440
amount of money in in into a startup

217
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,360
company called Breakthrough Energy which

218
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,680
is uh going big into into hydrogen. And

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,839
just to quote Gates, uh, it could be

220
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,720
gigantic or it could be a bust. But if

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,200
it's really there, wow. Well, also we're

222
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,519
hearing like people are estimating the

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
cost if they're going to produce it like

224
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
they produce natural gas by drilling

225
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,800
into a deposit and sort of extracting

226
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
it. And I'm hearing numbers like less

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,320
than a dollar a kilogram. Yeah, that's

228
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
right. So people are anticipating even

229
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,120
50 cents a kilogram uh for these

230
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
pre-existing hydrogen uh deposits. And I

231
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
think that's an order of magnitude less

232
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,120
than than what it costs to produce it by

233
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
hydrarolysis. So that's wild though. I

234
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
mean it's what a situation. Here we are

235
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,120
trying to make hydrogen through all

236
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,839
these complicated energy intensive means

237
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,080
and it might be beneath our feet at a

238
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,680
cost we'll probably never achieve or may

239
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
may never achieve with these other

240
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,200
techniques. That's right. It's uh it

241
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,000
might be really cheap and would be a big

242
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,000
help in the uh energy transition. So

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
there are a lot of as I said venture

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
capital companies going after this.

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,279
There are some startups. There's one

246
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
right up the street here in Somerville,

247
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,440
a startup called Eden Geopower. Uh it

248
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
was founded by two graduates of our

249
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,839
department. But the notable thing is

250
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,600
that there are no major hydrocarbon

251
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,160
companies investing in this. They are

252
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,120
all sitting on the sidelines with a wait

253
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,360
andsee attitude. And what they're

254
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,160
worried about is that yes, there'll be

255
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,600
some anecdotal fines, but there won't be

256
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,399
enough there to justify the costs of the

257
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,240
infrastructure to produce it. and to

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,760
really make a big impact. So, they're

259
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
playing wait and see. That's very

260
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,480
interesting that that you've got the big

261
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
I mean obviously like Bill Gates is

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839
plenty rich enough to figure to saying

263
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
like as you say like it could be big or

264
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,279
it could be nothing but whatever he's

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
got the money to bet on it but big

266
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,040
companies would also have money to bet

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,800
but it sounds like no they don't they

268
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,040
have not only money but they have data

269
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,320
and and considerable knowledge about

270
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
what's underground what's down there I

271
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
mean these companies have been drilling

272
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
holes some of them for hundred years or

273
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,440
more and gathering all kinds of seismic

274
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,760
data doesn't that give them a big

275
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,360
advantage spread. Well, one would think

276
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,760
with all these holes they're drilling in

277
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,959
the ground, but uh the issue is they're

278
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,959
drilling those holes to find oil and gas

279
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,279
and they're finding very little hydrogen

280
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,360
in the holes that they've analyzed. So,

281
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,519
that points to a problem and that is

282
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,760
that it is difficult to accumulate

283
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
hydrogen in the earth for two reasons.

284
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,440
One, you alluded to it being a very

285
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,959
small and slippery element. So, it tends

286
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,200
to escape. But the other thing is that

287
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,920
microbes, I'll call them bugs for my

288
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,800
geohysical terminology, bugs love to eat

289
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,920
methane. So the big methane seeps on the

290
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,839
earth are at mid ocean ridges where the

291
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,079
plates are spreading apart and they're

292
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
bringing hot rock up to the surface.

293
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,079
Those rocks are fractured. Sea water is

294
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,800
circulating through them and there is a

295
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,880
lot of hydrogen being produced. And if

296
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,360
there any any of these microbes around,

297
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,480
they will eat it pretty fast.

298
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,040
Do people in I mean I think it's like

299
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Michigan and Minnesota and Iowa under

300
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Lake Superior where some of this stuff

301
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,120
is. Do people know that this gold like

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,160
that they are you know like Texas part

303
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,279
two. Do they know this is happening?

304
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,279
Something good's going to happen in

305
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,040
Michigan. Well, it was realized in 2012

306
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,480
that we could get hydrogen from the

307
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,560
ground. in 2018 about these venture

308
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,360
capital companies began to be put

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,920
together and they began running around

310
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,200
scooping up leases in places like Iowa

311
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,040
and Kansas. Anyway, around 2 years ago

312
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,600
there was a great outpouring of

313
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,240
publicity in um journals like Science

314
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,800
and Nature talking about the potentials

315
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,639
of hydrogen. So, it's being picked up

316
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,560
broadly in the press now and everybody's

317
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,880
excited about it. So there's a gold rush

318
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,320
going on kind of getting going of a gold

319
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,680
rush and and it's not just in the United

320
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,240
States. I mean I'm hearing about big

321
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,839
discoveries in Eastern Europe, Africa

322
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,079
for sure, maybe South America,

323
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
Australia. Yep. It's all over the place.

324
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,800
Is that what's going to happen? We're

325
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,279
going to find this stuff and start

326
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
producing it like natural gas. Well, I

327
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,200
think that we will find some of it.

328
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,839
Australia is is pretty far ahead and you

329
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,839
know, new finds keep coming up. Albania,

330
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,240
the Pyrenees of of Spain. I mean, there

331
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
there are a lot of these places. As you

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,240
mentioned, Bill Gates has a lot of

333
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,079
money. He can bet on this. I don't have

334
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
enough money to bet, but I can bet my

335
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
time. Uh, would you say you have so

336
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,760
little money that you have to bet? I I

337
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,680
have

338
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,720
so Yes. Uh, I I I I desperately want to

339
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,320
make a contribution to saving the

340
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,839
climate. Earth scientists have this

341
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,440
saying, we have multiple working

342
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,839
hypotheses. And my working hypothesis is

343
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,000
that in the very near future we are

344
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,560
going to run out of the hydrogen that is

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,120
naturally accumulated analogous to

346
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,639
natural gas accumulations because even

347
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,959
if there's a high generation rate it's

348
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,800
it's leaking out all much faster than

349
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,120
natural gas would bugs are eating it.

350
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,120
Bugs are eating it and groundwater flow

351
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,079
in continental interiors is is pretty

352
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,279
slow. So I don't think we're going to be

353
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,200
able to keep up using this analog of the

354
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,839
you know kind of conventional natural

355
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,760
gas system. So I think what we what

356
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,800
would be the real breakthrough and I

357
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,600
think it's the breakthrough that we

358
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,839
should you know bet on here at MIT is

359
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,959
answering the question can we actively

360
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,959
produce hydrogen in the same way that

361
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,680
it's being actively produced at these

362
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,639
mid ocean ridge systems where water is

363
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,519
circulating through hot ironrich rocks

364
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,480
and reacting in real time and at high

365
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,560
rates with uh you know the water and the

366
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,079
rocks are reacting hydrogen is being

367
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,600
generated and and it's coming up to the

368
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,839
surface rapidly enough that there's more

369
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,399
of it than the bugs can eat and that it

370
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,720
could be produced. So, it's being

371
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,440
produced in kind of real time. This is

372
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,880
not like old deposits, right? Kind of

373
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
like there's deep water drilling like

374
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,199
you're down there in the water capturing

375
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,959
it in real time. Yes. As it's being

376
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,639
produced kind of. Yeah. So, not

377
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,560
capturing it from the water but actually

378
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,560
going down into the rocks themselves and

379
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,000
capturing it. Okay. This process

380
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,560
actually is going on right now in

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,480
Iceland. So in Iceland is on a plate

382
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,079
boundary where the European and the

383
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
North American plates are pulling apart.

384
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,160
Hot rocks are coming up to the surface.

385
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,519
That's why we have these volcanic

386
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,000
eruptions and the rocks are all cracked

387
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,000
up from the tectonics of stretching the

388
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,399
crust. There's water circulating through

389
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,120
there. Icelanders are using this hot

390
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,120
water to produce geothermal heat.

391
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
They've also been looking at the water

392
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,440
and realize there's a fair amount of

393
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,600
hydrogen in it and they are actually

394
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,160
extracting the hydrogen which is being

395
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,160
actively produced uh at the mid-Atlantic

396
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,320
ridge. So you mean you're you're going

397
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,240
to pipe away the water so to speak or so

398
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,959
so the water comes up they separate out

399
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
the hydrogen and then they like soda pop

400
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,560
like like it's like soda pop. They just

401
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,079
you know it it's it's also got some

402
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,320
carbon dioxide in it but they separate

403
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,399
it out separate out the hydrogen and

404
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
then there it is. It's it's collected.

405
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,079
So, if you got hydrogen in Iceland, what

406
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,639
are you going to do with it? Well, they

407
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,120
have a very clever solution. Iceland is

408
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,800
where a huge amount of oxide is smelted

409
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,800
into aluminum because they have cheap

410
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,480
electricity there. And what they've

411
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,120
discovered is that they can let the

412
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,279
hydrogen be absorbed in the aluminum

413
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
ingots. And if you heat the ingots, the

414
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,920
hydrogen comes out. So, they have a

415
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,519
perfect serendipity where they've got

416
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,199
heat, hydrogen, aluminum, and a

417
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
transportation mode. So, it all works

418
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,000
together. like many other things works

419
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,680
for Iceland might not work elsewhere but

420
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,240
so so moving it around is a problem

421
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,759
though I mean if if you gather it up I

422
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,680
was saying earlier you mean it doesn't

423
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
it's not a liquid at room temperature or

424
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,000
anywhere close to it you you have to

425
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,120
compress it enormously in order to get

426
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,320
enough energy into a volume that's

427
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,480
transportable can we move it around or

428
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,160
does that that create a huge problem uh

429
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,920
as you know it's it's expensive to move

430
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,480
around it is being moved around right

431
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,880
now primarily in the form of fertilizer

432
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,680
ammonia ammonia Yeah, the optimal thing

433
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,600
would be to uh produce fertilizer

434
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,440
locally. So you you pull it out of the

435
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,360
ground and then you think what did we

436
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,759
want to use this thing for? Let's have a

437
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,079
plant right here that makes fertilizer

438
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,240
so that we don't like lose half of it in

439
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,360
transport or this or that. It's just

440
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,800
another thing that works great in

441
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,440
Iceland too because they could generate

442
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,600
electricity from geothermal and use, you

443
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,279
know, the hobbos process to to convert

444
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,199
it into ammonia and ship ammonia instead

445
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,120
of aluminum or maybe along with you.

446
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,360
They could do that. Yeah. You know,

447
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,760
Brad, I as you know, I think a lot about

448
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,520
developing countries, countries that are

449
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,520
economically poor, but in many cases

450
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,559
also, and perhaps this is why they're

451
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,079
economically poor, also resource poor.

452
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,400
The possibility that they have

453
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,760
these hydrogen producing rocks right on

454
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,880
their doorsteps, right beneath them, is

455
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,039
is exciting to me. What about places,

456
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,360
for example, in Southeast Asia and and

457
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,840
in Africa? Is is what's the resource

458
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,200
opportunity there? Yeah, that um that's

459
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,280
great. And it's something I've I've

460
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,280
thought a lot about. So let's start with

461
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,080
Southeast Asia. India has a very large

462
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,080
deposit of flood bassults when the

463
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,559
dinosaurs were killed 65 million years

464
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,799
ago. At the same time, there was a huge

465
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,559
volcanic eruption going on over the

466
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,840
continent of India. And many people

467
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,320
thought that that's what killed the

468
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,360
dinosaurs. Anyway, so there's all this

469
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,080
65 million year old ironrich solidified

470
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,200
lava overlying a large portion of India

471
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,400
called the Dean traps and that is full

472
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,559
of iron. Uh this is basalt. It's basalt.

473
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,120
Yeah. And it's uh a lot of it is right

474
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,600
next to the ocean. So there's a a ready

475
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,120
source of water nearby. So that's you

476
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
know potential that you know I would

477
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,160
imagine could be lowhanging fruit for

478
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,679
the Indians. And then also in India when

479
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,240
India smacked against Asia to form the

480
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,679
Tibetan plateau and the Himalayan

481
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,000
mountains it trapped some very ironrich

482
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,919
rocks in between India and Tibet. So

483
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,600
that's another potential source of very

484
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,080
iron rich rocks that the Indians might

485
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,880
be able to tap. What about the rest of

486
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
Africa? I mean ancient

487
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,559
rockratons I think they're called. Yeah.

488
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,360
Yeah. So Molly is is in one of these

489
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,600
ancient cratons where these uh ironrich

490
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
rocks are called greenstone belts from

491
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,200
you know some of the fossil plate

492
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,120
boundaries back billions of years ago.

493
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,679
And also in East Africa you have the

494
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,000
East African rift where you know the

495
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,600
crust is pulling apart bringing iron

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
rich rocks you know closer to the

497
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
surface. There are volcanoes erupting

498
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
there. So that would be another

499
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,980
potential uh you know area where you

500
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,609
might find hydrogen.

501
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,609
[Music]

502
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,000
Let me just go back to the Midwest for a

503
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,640
second. It sounds like you feel like the

504
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,679
venture capitalists maybe they won't

505
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
make the kind of money they think

506
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,640
they're going to make or is that wrong?

507
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,640
I don't know if they'll make the kind of

508
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,799
money that they think that they will

509
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,120
make. There may well be return on

510
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,880
investment for the first wave of venture

511
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,240
capitalists. Okay. But whether this is

512
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,320
something which is going to sustain us

513
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,000
till 2080 for example, right? Will they

514
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,280
quickly run through? Will they run

515
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,880
through and and you know they'll make a

516
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,200
killing on their initial investment but

517
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,280
is it sustainable? Is it scalable? And

518
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,320
then another question is when you talk

519
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,600
about this the thing I think of is like

520
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,840
fracking. Um not very far from the kinds

521
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,360
of places that you're talking about. A

522
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,720
lot of people who live around fracking

523
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,919
sites would tell you it's not so great

524
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,559
and there have been a lot of problems.

525
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,160
So are a whole new set of people about

526
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,919
to come in for the same kinds of

527
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,000
problems that the people near the

528
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,440
fracking sites have? Right. So that's a

529
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,640
very good question and I think that's

530
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,559
one of the potential obstacles for

531
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
actively producing hydrogen. I I I want

532
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
to be clear. It's not going to be a

533
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,240
problem in Kansas where they're just

534
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,039
drilling in the same way that we would

535
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,000
for natural gas. But if you move to say

536
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,840
Southern California, there's a a a

537
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,440
spreading plate boundary that comes

538
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,120
right up into the salt and trough area

539
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,120
of of Southern California. There's

540
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,520
geothermal produce there. In many ways,

541
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,919
it's an analog to Iceland. It could well

542
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,120
be a place where we would produce

543
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,120
hydrogen and use it to make fertilizer,

544
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,799
etc. You know, I think you're you're

545
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,720
going to run into people who are very

546
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,880
worried about some of the same problems

547
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,640
that uh that fracking produces because

548
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,640
in order to reach these hot rocks, most

549
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,480
places you're going to have to uh drill

550
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,799
down and fracture the rocks to establish

551
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,120
permeability. Are you worried? and and

552
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,200
what do you think could happen um to

553
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,919
like ordinary people? Right. So there

554
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,720
are a lot of issues uh with fracking.

555
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,640
One of the main issues of fracking is

556
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
that a large amount of water has to be

557
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,640
injected into the ground and then once

558
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,600
the pumping starts the fractures close

559
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,640
and the water comes out uh the surface

560
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,480
this dirty water has to be disposed of

561
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:26,000
and that that's a problem. Okay. uh

562
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,240
stimulation of hydrogen uh that is not

563
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
likely to be an issue uh because

564
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,240
actually what happens is quite a bit of

565
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,320
water is absorbed by the rocks in the

566
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,880
process of getting of of forming the

567
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,200
hydrogen and so you put the water down

568
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,200
and it does not come back out. So that's

569
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,440
one advantage that it's got over uh

570
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,440
fracking for natural gas. You're going

571
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,159
to have to have an infrastructure to do

572
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,880
that. that infrastructure you can be

573
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,240
messy and there will be environmental

574
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,520
effects associated with it. Uh probably

575
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,159
the major environmental effect is that

576
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,480
when you inject water into rock and

577
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,480
change the composition of the rock, the

578
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,080
rock that's down there expands by a

579
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,919
substantial fraction. It expands by

580
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,520
about 30%. So, if you're have a a zone

581
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,679
of rock that you're producing at a depth

582
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,799
of a kilometer, it's going to cause

583
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,840
uplift at the surface. If you're tilting

584
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,520
the uh aqueduct and irrigation ditches

585
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,360
in Southern California, people are not

586
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
going to appreciate that. So, you're

587
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,840
going to have to be very careful to do

588
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,840
this in areas where you're not affecting

589
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,360
uh infrastructure. What about water

590
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,760
consumption itself? I mean if we're

591
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,000
producing something like well let's see

592
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,320
today's total consumption of hydrogen is

593
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,240
something like a 100 megat tons globally

594
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,679
right if we really go big time and find

595
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,120
other applications for it maybe we have

596
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,400
a gigaton right of hydrogen well okay so

597
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,799
you think about H2O O has a mass of 16

598
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,280
hydrogen's got two so that's eight times

599
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,039
as much mass of water so 8 gigatons of

600
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,640
water that's a lot of water or how is

601
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,720
that not a problem if we're producing in

602
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,559
the interior of a continent for example

603
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,799
Yeah. So, so the uh the problem is

604
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,760
actually worse than that. Uh because

605
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,400
your your uh your rock to hydrogen ratio

606
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,080
is not 1 one, but it's more like 70 to1.

607
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
So, you have to react an awful lot of

608
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,360
rock and an awful lot of water to

609
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,880
produce some some hydrogen. So, this is

610
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,520
being like injected. So, you're

611
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,440
injecting huge amounts of water. So, it

612
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,919
sounds like an awful lot of water in an

613
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,280
area, you know, like like Superior Lake

614
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,640
Michigan where you have all these rivers

615
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,640
flowing into it. It would not be a

616
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,159
problem. It would be a problem in

617
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
Nevada, for example. you know, if that

618
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,880
if that were were there. So, so so a ton

619
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
of water is just a cubic meter. So,

620
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,120
we're talking about 80 billion cubic

621
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,559
meters of water a year, which is a 80

622
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,559
billion sounds like a lot, too. But when

623
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,559
you figure out how, you know, how

624
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,120
fraction of Lake Ontario, it's it's it's

625
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,720
not that much water. But one great thing

626
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,640
about this is it does not require

627
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,559
particularly clean water. So, you don't

628
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
have to use potable water to do it. You

629
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,919
could use water from the sea. You could

630
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,480
use water from saline aquafers. So you

631
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,640
can use cruddy water to do it. So at

632
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
what point are we going to be drawing a

633
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,400
lot of hydrogen off out of the ground

634
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,760
and it's really going to be changing the

635
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
game in terms of like our energy

636
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,720
consumption? Yeah, you used the word

637
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,400
will a second ago. That's intriguing.

638
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,039
Well, maybe I should have used wood, but

639
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,279
uh um yeah, so I'm I'm I'm optimistic

640
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,720
about this. So right now there are

641
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,159
people who were trying to do this kind

642
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,080
of stimulation in Oman. Okay, so Oman is

643
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,400
a country in the Middle East. It's right

644
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,240
at the uh the mouth of the Persian Gulf

645
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,440
where all the oil tankers have to go in

646
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,400
and out. And they have a very special

647
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,279
geology there. Uh it was an old plate

648
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,799
boundary where some iron rich rocks got

649
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,279
thrust up to the surface of the earth

650
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,600
and they're actually exposed. And you

651
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,400
can go and look at the outcrops and you

652
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,120
can see this transformation of iron rich

653
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,760
rocks into serpentite. And you can see

654
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,440
that happening, you know, in the in the

655
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,840
outcrop. And there are actually projects

656
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,000
which are beginning right now. If those

657
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,480
work out, I think that one could begin

658
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,159
producing hydrogen in a place like Oman

659
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,120
within the next, you know, certainly

660
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,360
within the next decade. And once a lot

661
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,120
of hydrogen starts coming out, are

662
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,960
people going to immediately know what to

663
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,400
do with it? are they then gonna have

664
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,480
that secondary problem of thinking,

665
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,159
well, we don't really have a fertilizer

666
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,320
plant right next door and we don't

667
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,000
really know how to transport this. So,

668
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,520
yeah. So, that's that's already a

669
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,760
problem that that that's being worked on

670
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,240
in the Mid East. They realize the future

671
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,559
of natural gas you know with the carbon

672
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
footprint may be limited and they're

673
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,120
already you know investing in things

674
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,600
like you know fertilizer plants

675
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,679
exporting hydrogen from the mid east to

676
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,760
Japan for example using using

677
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,080
fertilizers so people are aware very

678
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,919
much aware of that and these companies

679
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,159
are carrying out reasonable

680
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,840
technoeconomic analyses to see how to do

681
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,799
this so yeah they're not going into this

682
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,320
blind so it sounds like in terms of

683
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,880
years We're looking at very soon. It's

684
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
wild, right? I mean, like in five years,

685
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
we could see a significant amount of

686
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,240
hydrogen being produced. That that's my

687
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,559
hope. You know, once it happens, I think

688
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,320
people will jump on and and you'll get

689
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,320
the investments and the technology that

690
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,039
you need to really then scale this up to

691
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,200
the to the size that we need. You you

692
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,279
mentioned that Breakthrough Energy is

693
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,600
investing in some of these companies and

694
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,880
there the Bill Gates company. Yeah.

695
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,159
Well, Bill Gates and others who are

696
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,080
putting money into Yeah. And also

697
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,240
philanthropists are going the Grand

698
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,720
Foundation has invested in this local

699
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,200
company up in uh in Somerville. Exactly.

700
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,120
Look, breaking rocks. Yeah. In Oman. In

701
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,400
Oman. Breaking rocks in Oman. Yeah. So,

702
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,240
this is kind of crazy that we've got

703
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,600
these philanthropic organizations doing

704
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,600
all of the exploration work and Exxon

705
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,960
and Chevron are sitting on the sidelines

706
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,279
twiddling their thumbs. I mean, what do

707
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,200
we have to do to get them off the

708
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,640
sidelines? When does that change? How

709
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,039
sure a bet does it have to be you're

710
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,039
willing to invest your meager savings?

711
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,440
Yeah. So, um I think the uh the oil

712
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,600
companies uh although they don't want to

713
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,919
redirect their research labs to do this,

714
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,840
I I I'm more optimistic than you are

715
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,159
perhaps because I less know less about

716
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,600
it than you do

717
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,360
as in your role in the energy

718
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,720
initiative, but I think the oil

719
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,559
companies should be investing in the

720
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,159
small projects it will take to actually

721
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,400
demonstrate the feasibility of this. So,

722
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,600
you don't feel like there's some sort of

723
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,919
herculean demonstration that has to be

724
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
made for them to begin to believe it's

725
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,760
inertia. I mean, this has only been out,

726
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,200
you know, for a few years. You know,

727
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
it's one thing to have these venture

728
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,400
capitalists running around, but if you

729
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,320
get, you know, the the gravitas of a

730
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,240
place like MIT saying, "We've got this

731
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,080
group of a dozen faculty. They really

732
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,919
think this is great." And I suppose

733
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,640
that's the other thing is that this is a

734
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,240
very multidisciplinary problem, right?

735
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,679
You've got to have geologists who know

736
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
where the rocks are. You have people

737
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,240
understand mechanics, understand rock

738
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
fracture, how to transport hydrogen

739
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
through the brines up to the surface

740
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,960
that how to stimulate the reactions on

741
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,440
the surfaces that are broken. So it's my

742
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,640
hope uh is that you know by seeing a

743
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,039
place like MIT invested in this and you

744
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,799
know these serious scientists uh who

745
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,960
have many problems they could work on

746
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,159
saying hey this is this is the one let's

747
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,840
do it.

748
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,000
Oil and gas companies are riskaverse in

749
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,440
many ways. They're making large capital

750
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,679
investments. They want them to pay off,

751
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,240
but they're also very sensitive to

752
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,679
public's reaction to what they're doing.

753
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
We were talking about environmental

754
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,559
concerns a minute ago. If we're going to

755
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,720
really be producing hydrogen beneath the

756
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,600
surface by pumping water down there and

757
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,320
fracturing rocks and so on, what sorts

758
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,399
of risks do do they need to be mindful

759
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,919
of? What what bad stuff could happen?

760
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,440
Yeah, I think that that that's a good

761
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,039
point and that's something uh you know

762
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,640
that we really need to take headon uh

763
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:45,039
before we run into a situation like it

764
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,760
happened with the fracking methane and

765
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,240
so forth. So just starting in uh in an

766
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,320
analogy with that. So hydrogen there

767
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,399
will be a certain amount of leakage of

768
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,919
hydrogen into the atmosphere. Okay? I

769
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,000
mean that's just unavoidable when you're

770
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,399
when you're handling this gas. We've

771
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,640
seen the problems that that happen with

772
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,360
the methane emissions associated with

773
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,840
natural gas. So people are right now

774
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,360
looking at the implications of

775
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,039
additional hydrogen in the atmosphere

776
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,600
and what that will do as a greenhouse

777
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,039
gas. What will it do? Nobody talks about

778
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,039
I mean I don't hear people talk about

779
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,720
hydrogen as a greenhouse gas. I don't

780
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,320
think it's a new thing. But first of all

781
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,240
I'll say we have hydrogen leaking out

782
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,600
all the time right so it's already

783
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,880
there. So the question is you know how

784
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,120
much are we going to be leaking compared

785
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
to the natural flux? But hydrogen by

786
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,039
itself is not a greenhouse gas. But

787
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,480
there are indirect effects and I think

788
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,200
you know probably one significant effect

789
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,080
which is easy to understand when we emit

790
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,799
methane into the atmosphere it decays

791
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,440
with a half-life of about 10 years and

792
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,279
that's because it's reacting with uh you

793
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,720
know oxygen containing radicals in the

794
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:52,799
atmosphere. And so if you put hydrogen

795
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,600
there it's going to compete with methane

796
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,880
and so the methane will last longer in

797
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,039
the atmosphere. It won't decay as fast.

798
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,799
It won't decay as fast. So, another

799
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,480
problem I mentioned previously was just

800
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,799
this surface deformation. It's something

801
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,799
that happens slowly, gently. You want to

802
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,799
make sure your pipes are not altered by

803
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,720
it, but it's it's it's not a showstopper

804
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,640
in in my opinion, as long as you avoid

805
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,640
critical infrastructure. Your pipes,

806
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,960
what it's a what's a pipe in and you

807
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,000
mean in your house? Well, in in let's

808
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,600
say uh if if you chilled with Boston, it

809
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,360
would change greatly the flow of sewers

810
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,840
into the sewage treatment plant. So,

811
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,399
that would be a bad idea. Yes. Well, and

812
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,600
I mean you see in California these like

813
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,360
amazing pictures of how the ground is

814
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,559
shifted because the aquifers have been

815
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,679
so depleted that people may have a field

816
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,760
of rice that's 7 ft lower than it was

817
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,159
when their grandfather had that field. I

818
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,640
mean like really shockingly different

819
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,000
and you can see it in, you know, sticks

820
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,080
that stick out of the ground or

821
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,840
comparisons of pictures from now and and

822
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,039
70 years ago or something. Yeah, there's

823
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,640
an amazing picture that the United

824
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,640
States Geological Survey puts out for

825
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,559
the the Great Valley of California where

826
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,000
there's a telephone pole and they have

827
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,399
ground level marked on the telephone

828
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
pole and it's down like 80 feet from

829
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,919
where it's a whole telephone pole from

830
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,279
where it is right now. So, uh that's

831
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,640
just from Pump Hill aquifers. That's

832
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,440
pumping the aquifers. Yeah. But but now

833
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,919
we're going to be going the other

834
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,760
direction. Now we can jack them up. But

835
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,440
you have to do it in the same places. We

836
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,120
can jack up Boston and Harvard so we

837
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,440
don't have to worry about MIT being

838
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,440
flooded by by Oh my gosh, we've solved

839
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,360
so many problems. solve a lot of

840
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,360
problems by selective uplift around the

841
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,880
edges of of continent. Brooklyn, we

842
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,399
could make Brooklyn a little higher. We

843
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,120
could sell Yeah. I mean, are we going to

844
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,399
really be producing enough uplift to to

845
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,000
be noticeable if we do this? Oh,

846
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,840
absolutely. Yeah. Because the amount of

847
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,679
rock that's consumed, you know, as I as

848
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
I said, you know, you consume like 70

849
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,440
times as much rock as you produce

850
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,159
hydrogen. And so, yes, you're you're

851
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,000
creating a lot of uplift. Probably we

852
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,679
won't be doing this in like Brooklyn and

853
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
Shanghai and stuff, but it seems like a

854
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,200
good place to do it. Yeah. But under the

855
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,880
great valley is, you know, is plausible.

856
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,960
There are iron rich rocks under the

857
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,440
great valley. So, so what reassuring

858
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,760
words can you give us to prevent the

859
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,960
legislators of the United States from

860
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,360
immediately going out and banning

861
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,640
hydrogen production? You know, I think

862
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,080
the most fertile place for largecale

863
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,399
long-term hydrogen production is is just

864
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,120
on the offshore. So, when North America

865
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,519
and Europe Europe split apart, the crust

866
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,000
got very thin, not very far offshore

867
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,399
here. And so we could do this under the

868
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,080
water. We know how to do subsurface

869
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,519
under oceans. So that's probably where

870
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,880
we're we're really the big hydrogen

871
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,080
production. So nearshore meaning we

872
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,919
still have to build pipelines, but

873
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,440
they're not long intercontinental sorts

874
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,720
of things. So we're just getting it to

875
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,039
shore. Getting it to shore. How far

876
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,799
offshore is that? Uh it's about 100

877
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,559
kilometers offshore. Okay. So it's like

878
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,159
offshore wind almost. Yeah, a little bit

879
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,919
further than offshore wind because it

880
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,480
it's in the somewhat deeper water. But

881
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,440
you know, I think another real serious

882
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,919
problem uh could be the uh seismicity

883
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,080
that's triggered by all this fracturing

884
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,320
of of rock, meaning earthquakes. You

885
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,039
just go too far, it lets go. It seems

886
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,880
like a real problem. Huge amount of

887
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:03,919
deformation. But I believe that that can

888
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,600
be managed. And one of the most

889
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,200
interesting things about this this

890
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,840
chemical reaction when you take these

891
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,080
kind of hard brittle rocks and react

892
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,240
them with water and you form uh rocks

893
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,039
like asbestous which are very kind of

894
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,880
soft and squishy these rocks do not

895
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,279
deform in a brittle way. They tend to

896
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,080
deform like silly putty you know very

897
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,880
very in a ductal way. So there's a place

898
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,320
along the San Andreas fault in

899
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,919
California which has almost no

900
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,039
earthquakes and the earthquakes it has

901
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,320
is is very tiny and it's a region you

902
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,799
know one or 200 km long that breaks the

903
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,799
San Andreas into a northern section

904
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,720
where the San Francisco magnitude 8

905
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,880
earthquake happened and the southern

906
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,760
section where magnitude 8 earthquake

907
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,960
happened near Los Angeles and in between

908
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,760
the plates are just slipping beside each

909
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,080
other just you know like they're greased

910
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,600
and huge amounts of deformation larger

911
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,679
deformation than than we would see

912
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,600
associated with production of of

913
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,760
hydrogen just happening without

914
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,000
seismicity because so the ground is

915
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,519
getting all changed and looks different.

916
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,320
So the plates are moving. You can you

917
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,839
can go to central California and you'll

918
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,320
go to a curb that crosses the San

919
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,399
Andreas fault. Put a paint stripe across

920
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,159
the curb. Come back in a year and you

921
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,919
can see that the curve has been offset.

922
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,480
Wow. No earthquakes in that time. It's

923
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,159
just slowly moving along, you know. So

924
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,079
the big one might never come to it will

925
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,839
never come to central California. People

926
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,240
are very confident that the big one will

927
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,359
never come to central California. So do

928
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,079
do you not worry then that this is

929
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,960
potentially induced seismicity is going

930
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,119
to be a a a break on the development of

931
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,520
of terrestrial hydrogen? I do worry

932
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,599
about that. I because my reasons for

933
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,679
believing that it will not be are

934
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,679
theoretical and based on analogy to the

935
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,720
San Andreas fault and and I think you

936
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,800
know this needs to be demonstrated uh in

937
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,879
the field and that there again that's

938
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,440
where this project in Oman could be very

939
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,280
uh very important because uh you know

940
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,960
there actually be breaking rocks there

941
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,240
injecting and and and so we'll be able

942
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,520
to if they uh monitor that adequately we

943
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,599
ought to get a much better understanding

944
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,320
of the earthquake generation associated

945
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,200
with this. So when you just think about

946
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,560
like right now in terms of your own

947
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,240
career, um does this feel like a very

948
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,480
exciting time and does it feel like uh

949
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,400
like a pivot point to you? I just wonder

950
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,960
in terms of like the you know the

951
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,240
research you do and the work you follow.

952
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,280
This is a pivotable point as I mentioned

953
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,920
before this is really an

954
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,920
interdisciplinary problem and you know

955
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,040
that's something I can do. I can I I

956
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,599
understand, you know, kind of the

957
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,520
boundaries between geology and geoysics

958
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,960
and fluid mechanics and stuff. So for

959
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,720
me, it's this uh new like play pen, you

960
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,320
know, that just came just at the right

961
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,720
time for me that I can, you know, think

962
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,119
I can uh you know, maybe do one more

963
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,880
thing before, you know, and and it could

964
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,119
be important, you know, if I can if I

965
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,960
can make a difference in uh you know,

966
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,839
the transition to a lowcarbon economy,

967
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,839
that would be very gratifying.
