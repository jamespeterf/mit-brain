1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,880
so today we are going to learn about

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,040
electrostatic shielding and why it's not

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,520
such a bad thing if you're in a

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,599
lightning storm as long as you're inside

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,880
a car here we have Benjamin Franklin and

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,120
he is about to be in a thunderstorm look

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,879
at what's happening to Benjamin as the

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,279
lightning bolt hits the grounding rod

9
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,640
Benjamin is not happy so now what we're

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
going to do is we are going to have the

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,160
same thunderstorm but we are going to

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,720
put Benjamin in a faraday cage same

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,960
tinsel skirt that he had before but this

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,239
time he is in a cage let's turn on the

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
lightning now if you look you can see

16
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,840
that there's that lightning bolt going

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,800
from the vandag graph right to the cage

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,360
here but now look inside at Benjamin in

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,480
there and his tinsil is completely

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,480
motionless I just got shocked but

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,640
Benjamin is completely safe this is the

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,280
phenomenon of electrostatic shielding

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,320
and this kind of a cage is often called

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,760
a Thad cage for more MIT moments from
