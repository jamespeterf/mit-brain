00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:03,489
(graphic whooshes)

2
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:04,440
(gentle music)

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,300
- Hi, my name is Hari Balakrishnan.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,040
I'm a professor in the Computer Science

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,780
and Artificial Intelligence Lab

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,240
and the department of EECS at MIT.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,260
About 20 years ago,

8
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,750
together with my colleague,
Professor Sam Madden,

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,570
I led a project in the
area of mobile sensing

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,770
called the CarTel Project.

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,000
With mobile sensing,

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,300
the idea is to take data from
sensors on mobile devices

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,270
and internet of things
devices attached to vehicles

14
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,460
to understand transportation issues

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,040
such as efficiency and safety.

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,680
In 2010, based on the academic success

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,730
of the CarTel Project,

18
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,820
I co-founded a company called
Cambridge Mobile Telematics,

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,990
or CMT,

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,150
whose mission is to make driving safe

21
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,820
and sustainable around the world.

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,970
The rise in distracted
driving has directly led

23
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,790
to an increase in road
crashes and fatalities.

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,120
At CMT, one of the observations
we made many, many years ago

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,710
is that the same smartphones

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,330
that are causing a lot of these problems

27
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,800
could be used as a force for good

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,110
because they contain a
large number of sensors

29
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,440
that could be used to
automatically measure

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,460
how people drive,

31
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,400
and that's what we built at
CMT over the past decade.

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,420
But not only that,

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,750
we've also developed an
innovative internet of things,

34
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,750
or IOT technology, called the driver tag.

35
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,090
These driver tag devices are small,

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,680
two-inch by two-inch devices

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,630
that attach to the
windshield of the vehicle

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,950
that come with their own sensors,

39
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,360
communicate with a phone,

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,930
allowing us to process data
to measure how people drive.

41
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,940
We built and shipped over 30 million

42
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,420
of these devices worldwide
over the past several years.

43
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,510
In 1998, there was a lot of
excitement in the community

44
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,600
with the possibilities of
bringing together computing,

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,770
wireless communication, and
sensing into small-form factor.

46
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,280
I got interested in how to
take this idea of sensing

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,590
and apply it to assets that were moving,

48
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,240
namely cars and vehicle.

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,860
- When I got to MIT,

50
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,930
Hari had been working
on the Cricket system,

51
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,610
which is an indoor positioning system,

52
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,860
and it had a lot in common
with the kinds of things

53
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,880
that we were building at Berkeley.

54
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,460
It was a wirelessly
networked sensor system,

55
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,470
and so he and I started thinking

56
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,360
and talking about how
we could collaborate,

57
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,460
and we both got very excited

58
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,140
about this idea of mobile sensing.

59
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,410
- In 2004, this was the
advent of the CarTel Project,

60
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,230
one of the first projects in
the world on mobile sensing,

61
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,260
which is combination of
sensors on mobile devices

62
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,720
and being able to draw
inferences of what was happening.

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
So we did a number of different things

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,660
within the CarTel Project.

65
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,190
Jacob Eriksson, one of our postdocs,

66
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,470
had this idea that, "Hey,
we built all this stuff.

67
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,580
How do we get a lot of data,

68
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,020
and how do we do
something useful with it?"

69
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,110
He said, "Let's partner with
local Boston taxi companies

70
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,730
and put this stuff on their vehicles

71
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,300
and go about driving and measuring
road surface conditions."

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,810
- We sort of doubled down
on this idea of safety

73
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,550
and measuring whether, you know,

74
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,410
drivers are safe and roads are safe.

75
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,720
We identified a number of
different commercial markets

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,640
with some of the big insurance companies

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,730
who were also coming to realize
that you could use sensing

78
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,950
as a way to really directly measure

79
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,420
whether drivers are safe.

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,880
- I started reading
about insurance companies

81
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,710
putting expensive hardware in vehicles

82
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,390
to measure people's driving quality

83
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,280
to price insurance correctly

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,740
and maybe give people
discounts for better driving.

85
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,760
If we built all this technology

86
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,490
with mobile sensing from phones

87
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,130
as well as inexpensive
internet of things devices,

88
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,340
we could absolutely beat these
expensive hardware devices

89
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,780
that people are going after.

90
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,840
And in 2009, started
the company on the backs

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,603
of a NSF Small Business grant, an SBIR,

92
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,260
that really allowed us
to take the technology,

93
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,790
license it out of MIT,

94
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,640
some software out of MIT into the company,

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,390
and that really led us to create CMT.

96
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,850
One of the challenges
to measuring road safety

97
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,890
is collecting large amounts of data,

98
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,800
and that comes from
sensors on mobile devices.

99
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,690
They come from the tags,
they come from phones,

100
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,670
and increasingly from connected vehicles,

101
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,710
and we also process
data from video sources.

102
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,420
But how do you calibrate this?

103
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,000
This is a piece of equipment in our lab

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,210
where we can take these
devices attached with sensors,

105
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,210
put them here, and then
rotate these devices,

106
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,730
so have them accelerate in
different configurations

107
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,680
and see what the quality is,

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,500
and then decide how to take that data

109
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,610
and put them in a form

110
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,530
that's equivalent across
different data sources

111
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,810
before we put them out in the field.

112
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,760
Advanced computing and AI technologies

113
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,990
are fundamentally important

114
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,910
to draw inferences from sensor data

115
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,160
to understand and improve road safety.

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
For example, when a phone is
in a vehicle being driven,

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,100
how do you know if it belongs
to the driver or a passenger?

118
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,420
Obviously, as a driver,

119
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,070
you shouldn't be using
your phone while driving,

120
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,170
but a passenger can use
the phone all they want,

121
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,510
so you need to differentiate
between these two.

122
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,980
So how do you know if you're in a car

123
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,270
or some other mode of transport,

124
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,280
like a bus or a bicycle or a train,

125
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,710
and that involves
machine learning as well.

126
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,420
The driver that's in a crash,

127
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,790
how can you tell the
difference in real-time

128
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,000
using noisy sense of data
between a genuine crash

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,340
for which roadside
assistance has to be sent

130
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,320
versus somebody hitting the brakes hard

131
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,700
and the phone flying off?

132
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,990
These are the types of problems

133
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,940
that we at CMT have been tackling

134
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,940
for the better part of a
decade to make our roads

135
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,070
and drivers safer around the world.

136
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,060
Over the last 10 years,

137
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,893
CMT has grown

138
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:06,360
to become the world's largest
telematics service providers

139
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,520
with over 450 employees.

140
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,890
What I've found is that
the two biggest attributes

141
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,260
that determine success in our field

142
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,896
are intellectual curiosity
and collaboration.

143
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:19,710
(gentle music continues)

144
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,300
This is a really exciting time

145
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,730
to be working in the
field of transportation

146
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,890
and automotive and road technologies.

147
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,740
One example of it is
understanding driver risk.

148
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,573
Another example

149
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,920
is in understanding the
inherent risk of vehicles,

150
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,220
and making vehicles safer,
and understanding road risk.

151
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,410
The combination of sensor technologies

152
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,850
and artificial intelligence

153
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,190
is fundamentally changing
these fields here.

154
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,350
So I couldn't be more
excited for the future

155
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,830
of how AI impacts road safety.

156
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,905
Don't drive distracted, folks.

157
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:52,644
(gentle music)
