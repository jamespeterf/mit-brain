2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:07,120
okay so now let's talk about how our

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,880
immune system uh works and how it

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,400
responds to cancer so our immune system

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,960
is classically divided into two

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,440
different branches the innate immune

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,199
response and the Adaptive immune

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,199
response and you can think of the inate

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,119
immune response is this really rapid

10
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,519
response to um some threat so for

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,840
instance if you get when you get a cut

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,720
uh you know you bleed but then you have

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,279
these neutrophils uh that quickly travel

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
to the sight of the cut and uh protect

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,600
you from bacterial infection so that's

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,800
an an example of innate response then

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,520
the Adaptive response is uh slower but

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,760
what's amazing about it is it can learn

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,840
to recognize uh threats that your body

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,360
has never seen before so for instance if

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,160
you ever had influenza infection or SARS

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,920
K2 these are things your body has never

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,160
seen before and your adaptive immune

24
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,359
response can respond to that now in

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,120
cancer uh the main sort of fighting U

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,719
cells uh against this disease are the

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,600
tea cells and the tea cells are really

28
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:08,640
uh remarkable uh and so let's talk about

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,320
how they work so uh this is uh what you

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
know a healthy cell could look like in a

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,400
cartoon schematic and in these green

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,759
squiggles are your genes and these genes

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,479
make little proteins that get displayed

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
on the surface of the cell and this is

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,479
called self

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,479
anen so our T cells on their surface

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,520
have a t- cell receptor and this is

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,840
scanning uh the surface of healthy cells

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,759
and the t- cell receptor has learned to

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,759
tolerate self antigens so it just

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,680
ignores them and goes away however in

42
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,520
cancer there are mutations that happen

43
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,040
in our in our genes and this leads to

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,360
this sort of red squiggly uh uh genes

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,040
here which get made into proteins and

46
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,920
now these proteins are different from

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,399
anything your body has seen before and

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,880
these are called nonself antigens and

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,439
now the te- cell jumps into action and

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,039
the t- cell receptor recognizes that

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,119
that's not a an antigen that came from

52
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,280
healthy cell and this leads to the t-

53
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,680
cell signaling and starting to kill the

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,840
cancer cell and remove it uh from the

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,760
body so each t- cell has this uh t- cell

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,840
receptor and the t- cell receptor

57
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,000
actually has a unique specificity that

58
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,400
recognizes the nonself antigen so in

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
theory our bodies can make a huge

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,200
diversity of these t- cell receptors up

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,599
to 10 to the 19 so this is a really

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,640
mindboggling number and what's awesome

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,879
about this is that this diversity gives

64
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,599
us the ability to kind of sense and

65
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,120
respond to really diverse threats that

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,680
the body has never seen before so this

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,400
can be viruses this could be cancer and

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,879
other pathogens uh and so here is a

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,239
scanning electron microscope image of

70
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,800
te- cells attacking a cancer cell and

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,280
each of these t- cells has a t- cell

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,080
receptor and this t- cell receptor can

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,959
recognize uh this non-self antigen on

74
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,840
the surface of the cancer cell so in an

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,760
acute infection like influenza or mild

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,720
SARS kv2 what happens is our te- cells

77
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,440
will recognize that this cell is

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,560
infected they'll start to uh expand and

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
kill those virally infected cells and

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,560
then once the virus is cleared uh the

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,400
tea cells return to normal and they just

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
uh return to this resting Baseline as

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,000
the infection is cleared however in

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,159
cancer this process is greatly altered

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,200
and the killing response of te- cells is

86
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,900
blunted

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,900
