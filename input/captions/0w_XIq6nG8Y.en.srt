00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,400
this is what if it works coming to you

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,279
from the MIT energy initiative and

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,480
looking at the energy solutions to

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,260
climate change I'm Cara Miller and I'm

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,560
Stoner and to start today I'm going to

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,920
throw out two words that are going to

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,560
sound I'm guessing kind of insane to you

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,080
here are those two words carbon tax and

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,240
you're thinking hm doesn't really feel

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,480
like a carbon tax is an idea with a lot

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,160
of currency right now but hear me out

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,879
this is a story with unexpected twists

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,600
and

17
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,399
turns there seems to be this pretty

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,320
pervasive perception in DC circles that

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,079
carbon pricing just will not work in the

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,960
US it's not wholly pervasive there have

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,760
been bills introduced every Congress um

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,600
including bipartisan bills but we wanted

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,480
to really try to get people out of that

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
DC narrative that's Katherine Wolfram a

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,440
former Deputy assistant secretary for

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
climate and energy economics at the

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,280
treasury Department she's also an

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,600
economist at the MIT Sloan School of

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,439
Management and the DC narrative she says

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,280
is based on the fact that people tried

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,720
to get carbon pricing during the Clinton

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,960
Administration and during the Obama

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,520
Administration but here's the thing as

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,520
she noted in a recent piece in the

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,920
Washington Newspaper the hill reality

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,439
and perception have shifted since then

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,479
look the beginning of the Obama

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,240
Administration was 15 years ago a lot

39
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:37,399
has changed since then I think a lot

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,680
more people are being exposed to climate

41
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:44,159
change in damaging ways I used to live

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,799
in California we had the blackout Suns

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,880
from the wildfires you know many

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,759
Californians experience wildfires in

45
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,680
their backyards that's just one example

46
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,240
she notes that among the G20 Nations

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,399
even though they have varied types of

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
governments and Leaders with a wide

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,039
variety of views everyone has carbon

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,599
pricing or is actively considering it

51
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:11,480
except that is for three nations the

52
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,160
three countries are Russia Saudi Arabia

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,160
and the US so just kind of not good

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,959
company for for the us and not only does

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,640
that set kind of a political example and

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,959
prove that it can be done but more and

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,680
more countries are adopting carbon

58
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,360
border adjustment mechanisms which I

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,040
think we'll get into and so that will

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,680
really Force our hands but you may be

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,360
saying very few Republicans would want

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,280
carbon pricing so isn't the concept kind

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,000
of Dead on Arrival well consider this

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,319
Wolfram says in an effort to extend the

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,159
Trump tax cuts one of the big questions

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,879
will be how can you pay for this tax cut

67
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,280
which is where carbon pricing could come

68
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,360
in there is a Republican bill Senator

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,480
Cassidy from Louisiana has it's called

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
the foreign polluters fee Act that that

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,480
would impose tariffs on Imports

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,599
proportional to the carbon intensity of

73
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,440
their production and there's a

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,200
democratic side Bill Senator White House

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,640
has introduced it with several

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,120
co-sponsors the one big difference is

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,120
that in Senator White House's Bill he

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,519
includes a fee on domestic production as

79
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,599
well where Senator Cassidy doesn't in my

80
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,680
experience in DC nothing gets more

81
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,480
bipartisan interest than being

82
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,519
anti-china

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,200
we know that China's production right

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,319
now is quite carbon intensive I will say

85
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,959
that China's pretty good as an

86
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,239
authoritarian government is kind of

87
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,840
turning on a dime so they've been

88
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,640
decarbonizing not quite as rapidly as we

89
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,120
have but but pretty rapidly so I think

90
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,480
we need to be a little bit careful about

91
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,599
getting too entrenched in this mindset

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,280
of China as this dirty you know monolith

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,200
and it isn't going to

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,680
change um Let me throw um a quote at you

95
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,079
on this issue of carbon pricing um we

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,640
talked not that long ago with Ernie mon

97
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,920
who like you spent some time in

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,879
Washington he was Secretary of Energy

99
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,400
and we asked like what do you think

100
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,199
about carbon pricing what do you think

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,880
of where it's headed and it's kind of an

102
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,560
interesting take to see what you

103
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,639
think I think that something like this

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,720
eventually is going to happen where the

105
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,400
big tension will be in how the revenue

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,919
Vue is

107
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,800
used I cannot name the name but let's

108
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,039
just say I not that long ago spoke with

109
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,039
a

110
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:48,280
prominent former Republican government

111
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:52,160
figure well respected in the Finance Tax

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,479
Arena and I was quite surprised when

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,919
this person said unequivocally he

114
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,600
supported the carbon

115
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,960
tax and we talked more

116
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,400
and then we found where there was a bit

117
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,400
of a breakdown uh in our views namely

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,199
his view was all the funds should go to

119
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,280
deficit

120
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,000
reduction well that of course is

121
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,960
completely

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,600
regressive in the end that may be the

123
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,120
negotiation how much of this funding is

124
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,800
returned uh to the population in a

125
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,199
progressive way how much goes to budget

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,560
balancing if I had to guess I would

127
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,960
guess that we may end up with that that

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,840
as the final

129
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,160
negotiation I mean that is sort of

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,360
aligned with what you said that maybe

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,520
you have people on different you know

132
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,880
sides of the aisle interested in this

133
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,039
but maybe they have different approaches

134
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,160
does that what mon said does that sort

135
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,720
of resonate with you I'm thrilled that

136
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,720
that's what mon said I think I've

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,560
updated my forcast of the probability of

138
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,960
carbon pricing passing by several

139
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,680
percentage points that's that's amazing

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,000
your hope casting has now like morphed

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,199
into forecasting okay okay yeah so I

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,520
mean I don't remember anyone responding

143
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,280
favorably to the federal government

144
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,800
raising taxes in this country or just

145
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,720
getting used to it I mean there's

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,520
enormous political pressure not to do

147
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,240
that the late George Schulz who's a good

148
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,759
friend to Mighty and was on our Advisory

149
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,400
board for many years chaired it used to

150
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,800
talk about a revenue neutral carbon tax

151
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,599
whereby everybody would pay these taxes

152
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,919
but then the Social Security mechanism

153
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,560
would be used to send everyone a monthly

154
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,720
check refunding all of that additional

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,120
Revenue to the people so that it

156
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,800
wouldn't be an additional source of

157
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,840
Revenue what

158
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:49,039
happened so yeah Schultz is a very

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,720
prominent proponent of the baker Schultz

160
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,000
idea and and the revenue neutral carbon

161
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,120
prices there as an economist the most

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,039
important thing to do is get the tax in

163
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,960
it actually doesn't really matter from

164
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,520
an economics perspective what you do

165
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,039
with the money let's put it back into

166
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,000
the 2025 framework where we're thinking

167
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,680
about these tax cut extensions one of

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,400
the tax cuts we're thinking of extending

169
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
is the child tax credit that's very very

170
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,039
Progressive and was shown you know it

171
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,360
was expanded during the Biden

172
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,360
Administration was shown to have

173
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,319
tremendous impacts on reducing childhood

174
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,080
hunger so if you use the revenue from

175
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,360
the carbon price to pay for a child tax

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,319
cut extension that's the even better

177
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,039
than the the Schultz idea right because

178
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,960
it's it's very Progressive it's not

179
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,639
giving everybody a check it's giving

180
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,039
low-income people a check and it's

181
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,639
something that both Republicans and

182
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:46,199
Democrats have really said yes we should

183
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,520
not only give that credit but it should

184
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,360
be more than it is so I you can see that

185
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,000
the there are multiple constituencies

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,000
from different places that could say

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,360
like yeah let's make that tax credit

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
$5,000 6 you know yeah if we have the

189
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
money to pay for exactly exactly species

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,280
of car or Revenue neutral tax in the

191
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,159
sense that the money is going back out

192
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,840
they're not using it for other purposes

193
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,759
or the general budget yeah but you're

194
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,720
not getting a check that says this is

195
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,440
your carbon rebate yeah so you can't

196
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,919
compare them well maybe that's bad I

197
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,440
mean if you can compare them you say hey

198
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,000
I made money on carbon this month yeah I

199
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,240
think there's a lot of research on like

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,120
what the best way to give the money back

201
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,159
is and there's some research from Canada

202
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,159
that suggests that even you know getting

203
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,200
a check that says this is your carbon

204
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,599
rebate people don't put the two things

205
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,479
together that when they're at the gas

206
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,440
pump they see you know higher gas prices

207
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,399
and don't remember that they got the

208
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,600
check there's also you could flow it

209
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,800
back through electricity bills and so

210
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,000
then it's kind of a line on your

211
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,200
electricity bill and and people see that

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,360
their electricity bill is

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
lower as I say I think the most

214
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,440
important thing is to to get it in and

215
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,079
so like whatever helps us solve the

216
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,519
political Dynamic and and get you know a

217
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,680
bunch of people in Congress on board

218
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,160
that's my main ambition is to get it in

219
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,839
place and and so I think whatever works

220
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,680
in terms of using the money that gets as

221
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,399
many people on board that that's that's

222
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,839
what we should go for but it sounds like

223
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,079
you feel like there's been enough

224
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,920
disruption in people's lives from flood

225
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,800
you know whatever it is that things have

226
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,040
changed like it's not the Obama

227
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,880
Administration anymore you know that

228
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,720
people have moved enough

229
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,120
on climate change that they're like yeah

230
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,160
okay I'm I'm willing to do something

231
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,760
that's what the polling suggests yeah

232
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,480
okay yeah so let's talk about something

233
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,760
I know you both have thought a lot about

234
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,000
which is you know so okay so we're

235
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,640
talking about potentially implementing

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you know a price in carbon in this

237
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,160
country but as you were

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,079
saying lots of countries have already

239
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,120
done this we're kind of way behind so

240
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,560
how are other countries doing this and

241
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,839
is it working out yeah in general there

242
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,279
are two ways to implement carbon pricing

243
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,079
one is just a straightforward tax and

244
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,839
and basically they're kind of equivalent

245
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,959
from an economics perspective there are

246
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:17,320
some subtle differences the other way to

247
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:19,560
do it is more complicated the idea of of

248
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,519
what's called cap and trade and

249
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,640
essentially this involves the government

250
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,680
creating essentially a chit that says

251
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,480
whoever holds this chit has the right to

252
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,440
emit a ton of carbon but it only creates

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,519
a limited number of those chits and then

254
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,959
kind of reduces the number of chits over

255
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,760
time Europe is on a path to reduce the

256
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,279
number of chits to to zero to get to Net

257
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,800
Zero by 2050 and then companies whomever

258
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,440
wants to emit the carbon have to trade

259
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,839
those chits you have to hold one of

260
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,480
those chits for every ton of carbon that

261
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,320
you eventually Emit and essentially the

262
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,399
market determines the price um it's much

263
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,480
more complicated to set this up than to

264
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,200
you know as I said add to our existing

265
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,839
excise taxes but the advantage is that

266
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,200
it creates something of value these

267
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,079
chits essentially and a perspective

268
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Global Market in chits if people find a

269
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,839
way to sort of move them around yes yes

270
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,120
and so I think that's one real Advantage

271
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,720
for lower income countries because then

272
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
people in higher income countries can

273
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,079
buy their chits so potentially somebody

274
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,440
in a poor country has these little chits

275
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:33,200
and they can give them to wealthier

276
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,639
Country for a bunch of money and then

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,839
that oil driller can drill for oil but

278
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,720
in in in exchange that poor person has a

279
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,880
bunch of money now yeah yeah which is

280
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,320
okay the idea being it's cheaper in

281
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,360
those countries to make some of the

282
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,800
mitigative measures that that could

283
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,760
reduce their emissions what do you mean

284
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,880
well you know a lot of countries in

285
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,920
Southeast Asia for example burn coal to

286
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,200
generate power with practically no

287
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,760
abatement of any kind whatsoever and

288
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,200
very inefficient

289
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,399
uh combustion systems so you can improve

290
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,720
those combustion systems without

291
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,360
spending a lot of money whereas we're

292
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,440
already kind of at a much more

293
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,839
aggressive level I see in the developed

294
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,720
world and that the extra ton the

295
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,360
marginal ton costs a lot more to aate

296
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,440
here than there so okay I'll pay you to

297
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,120
do it right okay okay okay yeah so cap

298
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,680
and trade how well does that work us

299
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,480
like trading you know I have a oil

300
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,560
drilling business so I pay you a bunch

301
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,839
of money to buy basically permission to

302
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,519
emit a bunch of stuff does that work

303
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,399
well yeah yeah there's tons of economic

304
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,399
evidence either the carbon tax or the

305
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,399
cap and trade system really helps reduce

306
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,399
emissions you know of course the higher

307
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,160
the price the the more it helps you know

308
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,959
getting back to our conversation about

309
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,040
DC's resistance I I do think the thing

310
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:53,639
that frustrates me most is when people

311
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,399
say well carbon pricing just doesn't

312
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,600
work because that's counter to all the

313
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,160
economic

314
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,920
evidence we do to get to you know Net

315
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,320
Zero by 2050 goals we would need pretty

316
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,880
high carbon prices but I definitely

317
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,880
think that we need an all of the above

318
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,320
strategy and and carbon pricing is an

319
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,480
important part of the the all of the

320
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,600
above I would say I mean just further on

321
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,720
what you're saying about the us falling

322
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,680
behind Europe and Europe being more

323
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,880
Progressive I

324
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,440
mean the the approach that we're taking

325
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,160
in this country which is kind of the

326
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,560
this the national spirit and it's kind

327
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,680
of what this program is is about is to

328
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,440
innovate like mad to find a way to

329
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,160
develop technologies that are not more

330
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,560
costly but are far less carbon intensive

331
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,120
and there's a great deal going on here a

332
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,240
great deal more going on here I would

333
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,600
say than in Europe so you know it's a

334
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,720
it's a different way of thinking about

335
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,720
the problem I would see the European one

336
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,839
is more

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
punitive that's often the way it's

338
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,320
characterized Europe did have and still

339
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,959
does have a lot of subsidies as well so

340
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
this gets back to my point that they

341
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:07,199
work together well I don't think it's an

342
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,199
either or proposition if you have carbon

343
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,160
pricing it encourages those innovators

344
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:15,160
to you know find ways to avoid paying

345
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,720
those prices so they can work well in

346
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,680
tandem yeah so what have other countries

347
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
and the way they've implemented a price

348
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
on carbon because you said there's like

349
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,680
different ways of going about this what

350
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,880
have they taught you about if we were to

351
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,639
do this and the president were to say

352
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,240
what would you what would you advise how

353
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,120
should we do this what would you advise

354
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,320
that's a good question so all of the

355
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,800
bills that have been introduced I'd say

356
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,360
in the past like five

357
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,920
congresses maybe not literally all but

358
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,279
but there's definitely been a trend in

359
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,920
the US away from cap and trade and

360
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,680
towards carbon taxes so the the most

361
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,560
recent Congress I think all the bills

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,839
are for carbon taxes and not for cap and

363
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:02,199
trade I'm not quite sure why that is but

364
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,759
I kind of tend to defer to people who

365
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,600
understand politics better than I do and

366
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,839
imagine that that's for good

367
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,839
reason administratively it is easier to

368
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,639
to implement the carbon tax if you have

369
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,920
the cap and trade system and you create

370
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,279
these chits there's political pressure

371
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,160
to give away those chits so then the

372
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,600
carbon pricing scheme doesn't end up

373
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,519
raising as much

374
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,399
money I do think the experience in

375
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:33,199
Europe highlights one advant AG of a cap

376
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,160
and trade system that is worth noting

377
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,040
and that is that it's flexible and it

378
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,839
basically responds to changes in the

379
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,160
environment so for instance before

380
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,560
Russia invaded Ukraine the carbon price

381
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,519
in the European Union cap and trade

382
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,480
program was about 20 um dollars a ton 20

383
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,199
euros I'm not

384
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,680
sure after Russia invaded Ukraine

385
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,000
natural gas got a lot more expensive and

386
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,720
so it was harder for electric power

387
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,639
plants to switch from coal to natural

388
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,360
gas and so after the invasion carbon

389
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:13,240
prices basically quadrupled they went

390
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,440
from $20 to to $80 wow during this

391
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,519
crisis right and so you could never

392
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,240
imagine if it had been a tax system the

393
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,360
European Parliament getting together and

394
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,079
saying okay let's quadruple the price of

395
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,519
using carbon in this time when we're

396
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:30,480
facing a huge energy crisis because of

397
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,720
the The Invasion but there was no you

398
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,519
know I I was kind of scanning because I

399
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,000
was worried about this there was no

400
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,720
obvious pressure to get rid of the cap

401
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,360
and trade system um at the time of the

402
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,120
invasion or in the immediate aftermath

403
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,199
but as I say you know the price kind of

404
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,160
adapted to the fact that the energy

405
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:53,199
situation was different and and Rose

406
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,120
dramatically so if if um carbon pricing

407
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,279
was implemented in the US in the way

408
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,360
that you think would be best as regular

409
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,600
consumer how would I see that show up it

410
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,919
depends on how exactly it's um

411
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,480
implemented but say we carve out retail

412
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,439
gasoline and I've done some modeling

413
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,679
work on this you probably about meaning

414
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,720
we're not going to touch the price of

415
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,160
retail gasoline okay yeah basically like

416
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,640
because like people are too sensitive to

417
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,919
that they freak out when exactly yeah

418
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,439
the US is so sensitive to gasoline

419
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,720
prices so you functionally the way it

420
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,480
would work is refineries would get a

421
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,080
refund proportional to the amount of

422
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,760
retail gasoline that they sold and so

423
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,520
the prices of retail gasoline wouldn't

424
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,360
go up you know I honestly think that you

425
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,760
wouldn't notice it that much our

426
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,559
modeling suggests that adding a modest

427
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,559
$15 a ton carbon price that that kind of

428
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:50,120
increased gradually over time would

429
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,480
increase the average US households

430
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,799
electricity gasoline kind of total

431
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,600
energy bill by by 1% so so would it

432
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,480
mostly show up in like my monthly Energy

433
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,840
bill

434
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,480
it would show up there it would also you

435
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,200
know the industries that would really

436
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,480
feel it are Industries like cement Iron

437
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,640
and Steel aluminum and so the Iron and

438
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,159
Steel the metal that goes into making

439
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,679
your toaster would become more expensive

440
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,159
but you don't buy toasters that often

441
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,880
and metal isn't a huge part of the

442
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,840
toaster cost so you know maybe your

443
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,640
toaster becomes like 2% more expensive I

444
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,159
I don't think that you would notice that

445
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,720
okay homes though maybe maybe like home

446
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,000
and building construct I'm just trying

447
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,200
to think what uses a lot of Steel cars

448
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,559
maybe and but also like if you were

449
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,840
building a highrise or you were building

450
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,720
okay so maybe the cost would go up but

451
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,880
maybe the Builder would say huh the

452
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,520
design that uses a lot of Steel I don't

453
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,200
like that quite as much maybe I'll go

454
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,120
with this different design that uses

455
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
some alternative building materials and

456
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,880
and so you wouldn't see the price

457
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,600
because they've done you know what we

458
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,600
want them to do and and use less

459
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,559
carbon so let's take a quick break here

460
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,240
we will come back and talk about a

461
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,240
totally new approach uh that Europe is

462
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,679
taking to getting carbon out of its

463
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,679
Imports we will be right

464
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:19,630
[Music]

465
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,640
back you're listening to what if it

466
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,600
works I'm Cara Miller in conversation

467
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
with Rob Stoner and Economist Katherine

468
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,880
Wolfram and we're talking about Crea

469
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,480
cretive economic incentives to reduce

470
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,679
carbon emissions one of which is an idea

471
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,960
that Europe has adopted it's called cbam

472
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,720
the carbon border adjustment mechanism

473
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,039
and what it does is basically at the

474
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,000
border imposes an adjustment for imports

475
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,320
proportional to the carbon that's used

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,840
in in making those Imports so imagine

477
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,880
your Europe and you're importing let's

478
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,280
just say Chinese steel say it takes 3

479
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,600
tons

480
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,799
carbon dioxide to make a ton of Chinese

481
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,280
steel and say you're a Chinese steel

482
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:09,600
maker trying to send your steel to the

483
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,400
the EU before the cam you had a huge

484
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,360
Advantage because the EU steel makers

485
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,919
were paying for their carbon emissions

486
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,320
the Chinese steel makers weren't so with

487
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,919
the seam it basically says when you try

488
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,679
to export your Chinese steel to the EU

489
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,000
you're going to have to pay proportional

490
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,840
to the the CO2 that you've used to to

491
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,559
make your steel and so it completely

492
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,400
erases that kind of competitive

493
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,360
advantage that you described we we can

494
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,240
no longer it's no longer cheaper to buy

495
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,000
things where carbon isn't priced because

496
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,039
we're doing this border adjustment to

497
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,200
make sure that all the carbon is priced

498
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,159
the other thing I'd like to say about

499
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,360
cbam is and I think this is where the

500
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,120
real beauty of the cbam comes in it

501
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,120
credits exporters if they have already

502
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,080
paid a carbon price in their home

503
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,559
country so going back to these Chinese

504
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,320
steel producers if China expands its

505
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,600
carbon pricing scheme to cover the steel

506
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,039
producers then whatever it's paid

507
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,240
whatever the steel producer has paid

508
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:15,159
domestically gets credited and it pays a

509
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,320
lower border adjustment this seems like

510
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,440
it gets complicated very fast though

511
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,000
right I mean you're a steel producer in

512
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:27,240
China China charges a different level of

513
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,080
tax in France you pay it or so the

514
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,200
government says like

515
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,520
a they may have a completely different

516
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,960
they may charge a third the tax you know

517
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,320
and so France is like well that's not

518
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,799
enough I'm sorry like we we want 3%

519
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,480
you're charging 1% is not going to do it

520
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,520
and also we don't even know whether

521
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,159
they' believe you like have you really

522
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,279
paid it the government says you have you

523
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,559
say I'm not sure like that there's tons

524
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,960
of trust with many countries and the

525
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,039
government that they're very very T

526
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,360
closely tied into industry I don't know

527
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:03,039
what I mean tell me how this works

528
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,840
yes I agree with the potential negatives

529
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,039
that you've laid out I have some

530
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,480
thoughts on that let me first articulate

531
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,240
the positive okay and we are seeing this

532
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,840
is that the EU bam has just really

533
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:20,080
galvanized a discussion worldwide about

534
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,200
carbon pricing so turkey for instance

535
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,080
half of turkey's total manufacturing

536
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,960
gets exported to the European Union

537
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,039
turkey did the calculation that it's

538
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,520
Industrial producers were already paying

539
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,000
a carbon price they were just sending

540
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,159
the check to Brussels if Turkey put on a

541
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,480
carbon price you know nearly as high as

542
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
the European unions it would collect the

543
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,080
revenue and keep it locally instead of

544
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,320
sending it to Brussels and so that kind

545
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,840
of logic is is just percolating

546
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,960
throughout the world and there are a lot

547
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,360
of countries that are thinking since the

548
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,640
seam about implementing their own carbon

549
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,279
prices so you know one thing you said is

550
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,200
what if the exporter hasn't paid as high

551
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,720
a carbon price as they would pay in the

552
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,520
EU then you just get credited for

553
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,320
whatever you paid okay to pay the

554
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,640
remainder you have to pay the remainder

555
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,360
and so again that incentivizes the

556
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,039
foreign country that the exporting

557
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,960
country to the EU to increase their

558
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,640
carbon price to the level of the EU so

559
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,240
that they keep all the

560
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,799
revenue you you articulated the concerns

561
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,039
about monitoring yeah I think those are

562
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,200
real and I think there are are

563
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,640
measurement

564
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,000
challenges I guess I would say two

565
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:37,240
things one as I said I think the the

566
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,240
beauty of the seam and you know it has

567
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,559
this funny acronym it sounds very

568
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,039
esoteric very complicated I frankly

569
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,720
think that it's the most important thing

570
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,279
that we've seen in global climate

571
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,320
mitigation circles in the last like

572
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:53,159
couple decades I think it's it's really

573
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,840
really important and is really helping

574
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,279
solve a lot of the problems involved in

575
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,240
getting Global carbon mitigation

576
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,600
so I think one thing you can do is not

577
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,799
say I'm going to try to measure for

578
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,960
every single ton of Steel how much

579
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,320
carbon was used but I'm going to look at

580
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,559
the whole country where it came from and

581
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,600
charge them based on kind of average

582
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,360
carbon emissions in China and so you

583
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,760
might think that that's kind of messy

584
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,559
and and then individual steel producers

585
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,640
don't have an incentive to reduce their

586
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,080
carbon but what it does give an

587
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,399
incentive to and where the bite of the

588
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,320
cbam is is it gives policy makers so if

589
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:35,960
you're charging every single export from

590
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,520
a country based on the country's average

591
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,760
carbon emissions then the country has an

592
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,399
incentive to to reduce their overall

593
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,360
carbon emissions or impose a carbon

594
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:49,200
price so for instance I like to say that

595
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,880
the the ideal SE bam is a seab bam

596
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,559
that's never implemented because every

597
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,880
country is encouraged to charge their

598
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,840
own carbon price domestically and you

599
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,080
know then you're all paying carbon price

600
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,720
and and there's no need to to border

601
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,039
adjust your point about do we really

602
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,520
believe like is some foreign country

603
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,039
actually collecting the money are they

604
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,720
actually really charging the carbon

605
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:18,360
price I think that is a real

606
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,600
concern I am encouraged by the

607
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,760
developments that there have been in

608
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,000
Satellite monitoring I mean it's sounds

609
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,760
kind of like 3D and futuristic but we

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,559
have satellites out there

611
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,279
I have a former graduate student who's

612
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,720
running an entity that that's measuring

613
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,000
kind of factory by Factory and seeing

614
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,720
what carbon emissions are coming out so

615
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,279
you know harder to hide it's harder to

616
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,960
hide it's really harder to hide so a lot

617
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,799
of the countries were talking about big

618
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,039
exporters to Europe or the United States

619
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,240
for that matter are lowcost producers

620
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,799
and these are typically emerging

621
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,159
economies

622
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:55,799
um and what we're doing with those taxes

623
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,360
is trying to push them in the direction

624
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:00,279
of developing low carbon Manufacturing

625
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,720
capacity and just generally low carbon

626
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,559
economies but that takes a lot of

627
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,399
capital so there's this sort of conflict

628
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,080
that I struggle with where does that

629
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,600
Capital come from if you were a poor

630
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,320
country you may be up against your debt

631
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,399
limit for example yeah that's a huge

632
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,960
issue in global climate circles um

633
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,039
climate Finance how do we essentially

634
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,039
transfer money to low and middle- inome

635
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,039
countries to the global South um to help

636
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,880
them decarbonize and help them as you

637
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,399
say kind of grow in a in a low carbon

638
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,760
way

639
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:35,080
if I were president of the world I would

640
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,679
basically use the seam as a reason to

641
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,440
get a bunch of high emitting countries

642
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,480
together and talk about what kind of an

643
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,399
ideal structure looks like and in my

644
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,679
view part of that ideal structure would

645
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:51,039
be using the revenues from the seam from

646
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,840
carbon pricing in the global North to

647
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,080
transfer money to the global South as

648
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,760
you say I think there are two reasons to

649
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,240
do that one is economic as we've talked

650
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,640
about there are more opportunities for

651
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,120
lowcost mitigation in the global South

652
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,120
but the second is really moral the

653
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,640
global North was able to develop using

654
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,720
carbon you know huge proportion of the

655
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,919
carbon that's already in the atmosphere

656
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,440
comes from Global North

657
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:24,960
emissions and the global South is

658
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,279
predicted to Bear the brunt of carbon of

659
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,480
sorry climate change so you know hotter

660
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,679
temperatures plac like India are really

661
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,159
really going to be hit by those higher

662
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,320
temperatures and it's essentially the

663
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,960
global South is suffering from a problem

664
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,440
that the global North has created people

665
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,480
talk about this idea of a carbon budget

666
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,720
that we've only so much carbon that we

667
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,640
can emit over the ensuing several

668
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,880
decades you're thinking is then that we

669
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,279
would make more of that carbon budget

670
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,360
available to emerging

671
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:56,919
economies so that they could develop

672
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,440
through their initial stage at least and

673
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,240
get rich enough to make these sort of

674
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,640
large Capital Investments but doesn't

675
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,000
that mean that we're imposing a higher

676
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,960
carbon tax on

677
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
ourselves um and and are we ever going

678
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,399
to do

679
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,320
that you mean like it's more expensive

680
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,360
to make a toaster is that what you mean

681
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,760
and then we have to pay for that or yeah

682
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,720
well somehow I mean if we're if we're

683
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,320
going to constrain our emissions in

684
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,480
order to make more room for them to emit

685
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,840
then we're going to have to increase our

686
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,960
carbon tax yep so so to I'm trying to be

687
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,240
an economist here yeah no that's exactly

688
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,200
right exactly right so so you know we're

689
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,840
we're we it's it's a funny way of

690
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,080
transferring Capital but that's

691
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,399
effectively what's happening we're

692
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,880
taking it in through taxation and

693
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,919
transferring it to those countries by

694
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,200
giving them more space if this is again

695
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,120
if I were president of the world I would

696
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,440
I'd vote for you thank you thank you I I

697
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,880
would be very focused on climate change

698
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,679
but if I were a president of the world I

699
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,559
would allow for kind of a graduated

700
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,480
carbon pricing scheme

701
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,200
so coming back to the cam you could

702
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,760
imagine designing it so that lowincome

703
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,120
countries get credit for kind of 5x

704
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,159
whatever carbon price they charge so if

705
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:16,080
the European price is 100 then a price

706
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:19,120
in mosm Beque of 20 would get them out

707
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,760
of of paying the European carbon price

708
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,640
and effectively that is letting those

709
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,000
countries use more carbon than we are

710
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,279
giving more as you say of the carbon

711
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,840
budget to lower income countries when

712
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:32,640
you talk about the kind of economic

713
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,440
unfairness it's a little you know what

714
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,000
we're saying in some ways is like okay

715
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,279
you all get refrigerators okay now we're

716
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,159
going to start everybody's going to have

717
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,039
to start paying a lot more to get a

718
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,399
refrigerator and everybody in this

719
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,159
country is going to have to bear that

720
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:47,159
whereas these people already got theirs

721
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,519
yeah yeah right and it that doesn't seem

722
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,120
fair it sounds like right yeah so let

723
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,640
them get their refrigerators for a

724
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,559
little bit less right it's not going to

725
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,640
be a lot more these are all kind of like

726
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,919
rounding around the margins and yeah but

727
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,799
but we're going get let them get their

728
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,399
refrigerators reflecting a lower carbon

729
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,320
price but I thought the thing that you

730
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,519
said before about turkey was really

731
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,480
smart that like turkey sends a bunch of

732
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,799
stuff to let's say Italy and it was

733
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,679
getting taxed and so where does Italy

734
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,519
send it to Brussels where the EU

735
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,000
headquarters is and turkeyy is like well

736
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,440
we we want it to stay in Turkey so we'll

737
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,640
just be more like efficient with our use

738
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,880
of carbon use less of it then we'll

739
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,399
we'll ta ourselves you know get it all

740
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,919
in our to keep it stay in our country

741
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,799
and then send it over when you know it's

742
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,440
pretty clean we'll send it over to Italy

743
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:42,240
yeah right yep I have a policy brief

744
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,600
that shows basically counts the number

745
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,679
of times carbon pricing cap and trade

746
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,919
decarbonization those words have shown

747
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,000
up in the press in countries that don't

748
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:55,240
currently have carbon prices and that

749
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,320
aren't the US and you really see that

750
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,559
after cam it it quadruples it's it has

751
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,360
literally started a global conversation

752
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,240
about carbon pricing not only about

753
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,880
carbon pricing we also track things like

754
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,440
green steel and decarbonization and

755
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,360
clean energy so it's as I say it sounds

756
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,279
esoteric but I'm super excited about

757
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,720
cbam how much is cbam influencing US

758
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:22,080
policy we export some stuff to Europe or

759
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,200
not that much I don't think I think the

760
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,840
US is a little bit insular to be honest

761
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,320
you you know continue to hear well

762
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,159
carbon pricing is impossible and yet

763
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,120
lots and lots of other countries are

764
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,639
doing it but right now the EU cbam is

765
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,360
kind of in a pilot measurement phase no

766
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,960
money is changing hands it will be

767
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,039
implemented in

768
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,919
2026 as I say there are all these other

769
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,760
countries that are thinking about it and

770
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:53,360
so I I do think between that and between

771
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,679
the conversations about how to bring in

772
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,080
money to pay for the Trump C tax cuts

773
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,480
that conversation will take place in 202

774
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,880
I you know that's why I'm hope casting

775
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,320
some kind of carbon pricing I mean we've

776
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,760
been talking mostly about like what

777
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,720
should the US do what's Europe doing

778
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,080
these kind of wealthier more mature

779
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,120
economies but I just wonder on the other

780
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,519
side of this you've got countries where

781
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,799
all the time lots of people are moving

782
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,399
into the middle class their poorer

783
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,360
economies but they're getting you know

784
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,480
richer faster we've kind of already been

785
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,840
through that sort of gross spurt I

786
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,679
wonder how you deal with the fact that

787
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,480
there's a lot of the world when you

788
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,360
think about like pulling carbon out or

789
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,039
emitting less carbon there's a lot of

790
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,399
the world that's still on the growth

791
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,320
trajectory and I mean what does that

792
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,519
demand look like from your

793
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,960
perspective yeah so this is something

794
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:48,480
I've done research on people when when

795
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,200
you're very very poor if your income

796
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,720
goes up you spend more of your income on

797
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,880
higher quality protein for instance or

798
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,880
or just higher quality calories but as

799
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,840
you come out out of poverty and enter

800
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,799
the middle class you start doing things

801
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,799
like buying a refrigerator buying a car

802
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:09,679
buying a a motorcycle and those things

803
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,519
all require energy so you do see this

804
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,279
kind of you know step change in energy

805
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:17,399
consumption as more people come out of

806
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,760
poverty and enter the middle

807
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:22,360
class that said we've been talking about

808
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,200
this from a climate change perspective

809
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,120
so that does is accompanied by more

810
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,720
carbon emissions but it's also

811
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,279
accompanied with people getting access

812
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,799
to refrigerators right and and

813
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,200
refrigerators are great because they

814
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:38,039
keep food cool keep medicines cool and

815
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,679
you know being able to drive gets people

816
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,600
to better jobs so those things are

817
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,679
associated with economic progress which

818
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,200
we want to cheer for th those are it's

819
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,200
great when people come out of poverty

820
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,240
and and come into the middle class you

821
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,880
know the hope is that we can get to a

822
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,600
point where Energy Systems

823
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,360
don't emit as much carbon or don't emit

824
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,760
nearly as much carbon so that as people

825
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,200
come into the middle class they're

826
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,159
buying refrigerators made with green

827
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,560
steel or they're driving you know

828
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,320
electric mopeds and so the the kind of

829
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,919
increase in carbon emissions isn't

830
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,040
associated with with that economic

831
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:22,919
growth does that feel realistic if

832
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,079
you're talking about millions of people

833
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:30,040
or tens of millions of people entering

834
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:33,359
that like a wealthy sort of phase I know

835
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,800
we're hoping that we can mitigate the

836
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,960
amount of carbon in the air we can

837
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,520
produce less but does that feel

838
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,440
reasonable when you look at countries

839
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,399
that are on that upward sort of growth

840
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,599
trajectory on the one hand fossil fuels

841
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,639
have been used because fossil fuels have

842
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,639
lots of great properties I know that

843
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,000
sounds funny for someone from a climate

844
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,159
with for someone with a climate

845
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,160
perspective to

846
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:02,480
say but you know oil has become so

847
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,079
dominant globally because it's a very

848
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,520
very it's a very good energy storage

849
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,160
mechanism basically it's not that heavy

850
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,560
you can use it in a car transportation

851
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,640
and and the energy you get out of that

852
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:17,079
oil is is is super valuable for the the

853
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,760
weight of that

854
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:23,880
oil um that said we are making a lot of

855
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,160
progress on making electric vehicles

856
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,960
cheaper making batteries cheaper making

857
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,040
things like solar panels cheaper

858
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,960
and I will

859
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:39,440
say I think we don't we can't paint the

860
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,320
global South with one brush there are

861
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,480
parts of the global South where you know

862
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:49,560
solar and wind is super abundant if you

863
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,240
think about Africa right now leaving out

864
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,680
South Africa over half of the

865
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,680
electricity is made with renewable you

866
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,160
know Hydro or um geothermal

867
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,680
um electricity

868
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:09,200
so and and they have very great solar

869
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,160
potential coming back to the seam I

870
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,560
heard at cop a NGO that the head of an

871
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,440
NGO from Africa

872
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,760
describing his vision for green Le

873
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,680
African growth he was saying that it

874
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,240
used to be the case that in Europe

875
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,440
energy flowed from the East to the West

876
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,960
you coal mines in Poland and they were

877
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,240
feeding the auto manufacturing plants in

878
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,640
Germany his vision is that in the future

879
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,280
in a world where we're pricing carbon

880
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,240
where that coal is really expensive to

881
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,119
use he hopes that we will see energy

882
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,440
flowing from the south to the north that

883
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,240
African potential to have you know very

884
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,800
abundant solar abundant wind will help

885
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,200
fuel the the production you know maybe

886
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,280
some of that production will actually

887
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,280
move to Africa and Africa can become you

888
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,839
know a green steel Powerhouse and send

889
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,960
that steel to the the consumers in

890
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,000
Europe so kind of transform the way

891
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:16,640
energy flows based on the huge renewable

892
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,319
energy solar potential that we see in

893
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,079
Africa Rob you've spent so much time in

894
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:24,880
Africa I don't know I wonder if you have

895
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,000
some of those concerns of like oh this

896
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,160
is great people are doing better but

897
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
then the pr pressure that that puts on

898
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,960
you know as as Katherine said I mean

899
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,640
fossil fuels there's a reason people use

900
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,599
them like coal oil these are very very

901
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,920
effective easily transportable like

902
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,599
there's lots of things that are good

903
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,160
about them um except for the obvious

904
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,119
yeah well there always ironic that

905
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,760
Africa is a big producer many many parts

906
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,359
of Africa are big producers of oil and

907
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,240
gas and yet they benefit very little

908
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,359
from that I mean the present day carbon

909
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,520
footprint of Africa is so trivial that I

910
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,880
think it's not an issue um and the

911
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,720
emphasis should be on economic

912
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,319
development however you can do it in in

913
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,920
at least the foreseeable future um that

914
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:08,760
but you know beyond that stage they

915
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,319
certainly have to get onto a a renewable

916
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,240
track a lowc carbon track and I think

917
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,520
they can but they really stand to be

918
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,960
beneficiaries of what we learn in the

919
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
next couple of

920
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,319
decades I guess finally you know we've

921
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,920
talked so much about um economic policy

922
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:29,040
and I wonder if what we have looked at

923
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,200
on the men you in terms of like the

924
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,119
these are the carrots and sticks or as

925
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,359
Ernest mon said the carrots and twigs

926
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,160
that we're using do we have like the

927
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:42,760
right things on the menu I

928
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,119
think it depends what you describe as

929
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,079
the menu like if the menu is the set of

930
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,920
things that policy makers can choose

931
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:53,400
from I think we have the right things

932
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,160
yeah carbon pricing is an old idea in

933
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,160
economics it's been around for over a

934
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,640
hundred years it it's really kind of

935
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,280
econ 101 answer to an externality which

936
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,880
is what we have we have a global

937
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,839
externality with climate change you know

938
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,319
what policy makers are ordering off the

939
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,599
menu I think is the is the challenging

940
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:17,359
part and it's a global

941
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,240
problem

942
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,520
globally without something like seam

943
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,680
every individual country has the

944
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,440
incentive to kind of sit back and hope

945
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,880
that other countries really take the

946
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,160
lead and so that's why I'm really

947
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,960
encouraged by cbam it it it pushes

948
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,160
countries not to as economists would say

949
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,480
free ride around along with other

950
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,640
people's or other Count's policy

951
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,040
initiatives but join those those policy

952
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,760
initiatives and so yeah to use your menu

953
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,160
analogy I think that the the cbam and

954
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,800
related initiatives will help policy

955
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,960
makers make the right choice off that

956
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,480
menu as I've said I think it's an all of

957
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,839
the above strategy I think as we' talked

958
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,960
about subsidies are great subsidies and

959
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,920
taxes are even better so I I would love

960
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,599
a world that had both yeah carrots and

961
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,800
sticks I wonder too if there's there's

962
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,440
something of a kind of outsize influence

963
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,680
of like when Europe says we're going to

964
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,240
tax carbon and so turkey says well in

965
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,720
order to sell our stuff to Europe we're

966
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,040
going to have to reconfigure things

967
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,680
around here or as you said you know

968
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,000
we'll Tex carbon ourselves and then

969
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,359
we'll get all the revenue and then we'll

970
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,920
sell Europe and they'll be like okay

971
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,000
great the tax was levied okay perfect

972
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,839
come on in I wonder if then you get this

973
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,760
kind of domino effect where even if we

974
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,480
don't even if the US just has too many

975
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,040
divisions we cannot get together

976
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,800
politically it can't happen all the

977
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,880
stuff we get from turkey and Vietnam

978
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,400
like it's already been taxed for carbon

979
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,480
because in order to sell to France and

980
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,720
Italy and the UK they have to do it

981
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,319
anyway yeah and I think the the real

982
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,280
domino effect that's exactly the analogy

983
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,359
that it it becomes kind of tipping you

984
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,319
know positive feedback cycle and if

985
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,480
Canada and Mexico imposed SE bams the US

986
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,240
would pay attention we export a lot to

987
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,079
those countries we don't export that

988
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,720
much to the

989
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,680
EU I hope that it doesn't take that

990
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,160
though I yeah I think that's kind of

991
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,920
part of of what will get politicians

992
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,720
attention but as we talked about at the

993
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,319
beginning I think the revenues that

994
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,760
carbon pricing introduces as well as as

995
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,760
kind of seeing that this is what's

996
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,920
happening around the world I I think we

997
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
can kind of forecast that it might

998
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,800
happen that we would be taxed by by

999
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,200
Canada and Mexico instead of waiting

1000
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,760
until that actually happens and

1001
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:43,000
hopefully we'll kind of get off the the

1002
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,200
ground quicker than yeah waiting for

1003
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,640
those I'm developing this image as

1004
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,599
you're talking of countries segregating

1005
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,599
their manufacturing into a clean part

1006
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,000
that goes to Europe it's not worth it

1007
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,240
you know it makes me think of like when

1008
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,760
California says well this is how cars

1009
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,920
are going to have to be what are you

1010
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,040
going to have a a plant where you make

1011
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,520
the cars for Utah time like one for C it

1012
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,640
doesn't make sense California keep all

1013
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,960
your coal plants in China and say okay

1014
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,720
well those coal plants are going to run

1015
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,960
all of these factories and these solar

1016
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,920
panels are going to run those ones we'll

1017
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,640
export that stuff to Europe well and

1018
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,640
we'll export the the coal there's some

1019
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,680
dominoes that'll probably just fall

1020
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,680
because it's just too complicated but

1021
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,920
maybe there's some that that wouldn't no

1022
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,359
and as you say if enough countries do it

1023
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,280
it helps the Technologies get cheaper

1024
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,720
that's exactly the the the California

1025
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,200
analogy yeah I like that yeah I agree

1026
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,200
with you I'm just trying to cast a doomy

1027
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,599
or

1028
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,170
