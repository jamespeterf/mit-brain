00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,680
hello the goal of this tutorial is to

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,200
showcase the downstream large- scale

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,960
application of apis integrated with in

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,679
the genomics to proteins portal note

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,560
that the data accessible via these apis

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,359
are also accessible via the portal for

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,480
example through the gene protein lookup

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,160
module and interactive mapping module

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,039
but through the portal they're only

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,480
available on a gene by Gene basis the

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,960
purpose of these apis is to allow for

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,760
large scale access of the data for

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,399
example for the entire human proteome

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,440
this tutorial is aimed for exactly that

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,360
and targeted for users with a coding or

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,360
bioinformatics

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,680
background the apis that we'll talk

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,440
about today are the g2p 3D API which

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,879
provides a gene to transcript to protein

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,399
isopor to structure mapping for the

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,120
ident for all of the corresponding

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,360
identifiers and the g g2p protein

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,880
feature API which provides a rich

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,720
protein feature set at the amino acid

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,520
level which includes structural sequence

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,520
and functional

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,400
properties through the Swagger through

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,720
the Swagger page we can directly access

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,040
the apis for example by providing a gene

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,119
and unipro

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,320
ID and we can easily execute the API and

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,159
view the result in a spreadsheet format

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:37,119
for example with Excel so here we can

34
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:41,119
clearly see this um the g2p 3D API

35
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,840
provided mapping and here we have listed

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,320
the unipro IDS Associated isoforms Gene

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,719
transcript and the associated pdb

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,960
structures so here we can clearly see

39
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:57,520
the associated pdb structures match to

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,520
the canonical unip protein

41
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:05,479
isopor so how how will we apply this for

42
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:09,039
our analysis so as an example um let's

43
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:11,440
take the shoper own the shoper own

44
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,040
proteins so the panther protein

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,959
classification system identified over

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,519
100 chaperon

47
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,840
genes and we'd like to characterize

48
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:25,280
those genes to better understand um the

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,360
available data and um and functional

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,160
properties so to do this we're first

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,560
going to get a list of the of the list

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
of the genes and proteins which we can

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,200
do from the feros portal by filtering on

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,519
the panther protein class and then

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,560
downloading um a list of the associated

56
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,640
genes then we can Leverage The g2p

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,200
Client API which is a python Library

58
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,879
where we could just where we can easily

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,239
access the g2p API

60
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,280
programmatically and get the results as

61
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,480
Panda's data frames which are easy to

62
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,760
use for Downstream

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,519
analysis okay so let let's jump into our

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,640
analysis so here we have a jupyter

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,640
notebook where we can easily install and

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
import the g2p

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,599
API and here we'll load in our list of

68
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,879
shop runs that we downloaded from the

69
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,159
feros portal and you can see here um we

70
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,799
have all the shoper own proteins we've

71
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,640
listed the first five and available

72
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,000
annotation

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,239
data okay now we're going to use the g2p

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,159
API to systematically get all of the

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,959
transcript information for the shop

76
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,159
runes so here we'll get the unipro ID

77
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:44,000
and G name for each shoppr and then

78
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:46,840
we'll call the this g2p 3D API directly

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,840
using the client

80
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,239
Library so now we can inspect our

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,640
results from the call and we can see

82
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:04,480
that we have all of these we have 3 70

83
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:09,120
entries across the 110 chaperon

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,200
jeans and we we can see the the mappings

85
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,079
for each of those entries now in one

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,840
large data frame with transcript

87
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,479
information Gene protein isopor and

88
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,360
structure as

89
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:25,120
expected okay so now let's do some

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,400
analysis we'd like to see how frequently

91
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,639
the main select

92
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,400
transcript maps onto the iCal protein

93
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,639
isopor so to do this we're going to map

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,479
we're going to

95
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,919
filter for rows that contain the main

96
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,759
select transcript and the canonical

97
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,360
protein isopor to identify what fraction

98
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,360
of genes have that

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,840
mapping um this is um this is important

100
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,120
for structure mapping because variants

101
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,720
that are annotated onto the main select

102
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,120
transcript um because variants are

103
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,320
frequently annotated onto the main

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,960
select transcrip script and if it's

105
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,160
associated with the canonical protein

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,039
isopor which is frequently the isopor

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,840
for which structures are available then

108
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:13,880
we can easily map those variants onto

109
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,960
the protein structure so here we just

110
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,800
went through and we identified that of

111
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,520
the

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,000
110 um chaperon genes

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,880
95 had a main select transcript that

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
mapped onto the protein the canonical

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,240
protein isopor and we can easily plot

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,120
this in our Jupiter notebook so here we

117
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,960
can see

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,240
95 of the main select transcripts mapped

119
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,319
successfully onto the canonical protein

120
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,520
isopor now let's move on to the protein

121
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:48,039
structure characterization so now we'll

122
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:50,880
again use the g2p API to call um the g2p

123
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,120
API client Library excuse me to

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,479
systematically call the Gap protein

125
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,919
feature API and get the rich amino acid

126
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,880
wide protein features for every one of

127
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,280
The Chaperone genes

128
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,960
so here we'll again use the library to

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,960
make the API

130
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,000
call and now we're going to look for

131
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,919
each of the proteins we're going to look

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,039
at the secondary structure

133
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,840
propensity and so here one of the

134
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,919
features here we have is the dssp three

135
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,000
state secondary structure computed on

136
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,599
Alpha fold

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,240
structure and so we can plot the we can

138
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,720
plot the propensity

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,560
of each of these and we can see that 45%

140
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,240
of amino acids are Helix residues 43%

141
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,560
are coil and 11% are strand note that we

142
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,199
also have sift secondary structure

143
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,599
computed on the pdb structures if you'd

144
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,599
like to look at pdb structure

145
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,560
propensity um

146
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,759
and um over and you can conduct a

147
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,520
variety of other Downstream

148
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,280
analysis Okay so in conclusion we saw

149
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,800
the g2p 3D

150
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,560
API and the protein feature API

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,319
available through the

152
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,520
portal um and we could access these apis

153
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,199
through two Avenues one through the one

154
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,400
we can access them through the Swagger

155
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,520
page where we can test out the apis and

156
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,599
experiment and secondly we can access

157
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,840
them through the python client

158
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,160
Library where we can import um we can

159
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,039
import the library and scale up our

160
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,039
workflows we can also access notebooks

161
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,360
from previous tutorials inside inside

162
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,360
the client Library GitHub

163
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,639
repository and and in that way we can

164
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,720
characterize different sets of genes for

165
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,919
Downstream

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,960
analysis in addition we also have

167
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,000
previous

168
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,599
tutorials on the gene lookup module

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,240
interactive mapping and a variety of CAS

170
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,159
studies so if you navigate to the

171
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,960
documentation page within the portal

172
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:09,840
here or to our YouTube

173
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,879
channel you can you can see previous

174
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,759
tutorials and review um other

175
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,639
functionality and last but not least

176
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,440
please leave us any feedback that you

177
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,440
may have and thank you for your

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,440
attention
