professor of computer science at CMU and

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
the founder of patent. His research

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,000
focused on the development of machine

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,320
systems and architectures for solving

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,640
problems involving automatic learning,

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
reasoning and decision making in high

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,640

society and fellows of the triple triple

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,920
E and ASA. Eric, I'm excited for your

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,920
talk and the floor is all yours.

24
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:09,119
[Applause]

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,119
Well, thank you very much. Uh I want to

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,600
thank Caroline and the colleagues for

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,240
inviting me here. I had uh really a

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
feast of uh you know of uh learning you

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,759
know for the past two days you know

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,799
learning all these uh very wonderful

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,680
exciting uh projects and ideas which

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,840
actually uh pushed me to uh like a many

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
you know edit my slides almost

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,799
constantly because I feel like the stuff

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
I prepare to talk about can be easily

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
outdated by the new presentations in

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,720
here. So I try to make it more fun. In

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,920
fact, just a minute ago, I added a few

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,720
more slices just to give a maybe a fun

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
context of this. So, we are here to

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,759
solve very complex problems. In a sense,

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,880
it's a you know a form of complex

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,200
reasoning. And I heard the word LLM, you

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,159
know, has been mentioned all the time

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
and LM has now been also a backbone for

46
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,159
many other applications that is

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,680
mentioned in here. you know uh you know

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,439
in fact the the architecture was

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,319
directly borrowed to train DNA models

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,200
and RNA models but I think there is a

51
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,440
need to really take a maybe a step back

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,200
and look at what is this whole business

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,400
is about what is LM and uh and what the

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,200
potential that we might have ignored so

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
LM is basically a system that does uh

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,760
reasoning you know inside you know the

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,680
space of

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,879
language it is actually not meant to be

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,040
built to make chat bots or to make uh

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,040
linguistic functions. Okay, it is

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,319
actually originally built to be a next

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,959
word generator that is meant to simulate

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,440
linguistic behaviors. Basically, it is a

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,160
success when you feel what you get out

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,599
of a LM interface does not look

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,720
different from a human. So, it is

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,879
simulating a human in the special

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,560
language. And LM doesn't work when you

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,800
add a space to make it bigger to have

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,879
images and uh when you have you know uh

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
you know adversaries and other agents

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,040
you know you add another degree of

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,599
dimensions and uh we are here you know

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
in fact we are now in a space of study

75
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,480
nature laws right so the problem become

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,959
really really complex how we might

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,200
approach it what is the kind of a

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
fundamental spirit inside large language

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,920
models and foundation models that we

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,879
could even borrow but not necessarily

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,319
just directly use to attract and to

82
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,519
attack bigger problem. So I heard I I

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,239
hope some of you who are like myself a

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,879
sci-fi fan have heard about the story of

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,080
Doom. Have you heard about that? Right.

86
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,040
Don is a super intelligent agent which

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,440
solves larger problems like all of us

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,080
larger problems. They saw problems like

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,879
uh winning a galactic war uh

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
transforming the climate and turn desert

91
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,360
into greenlands and so forth. So these

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,599
are problems really difficult right and

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,319
uh one thing very interesting in the

94
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,040
book is that uh he solves the problem in

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,280
a way that is very different from uh uh

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,120
way physicist and mathematicians who are

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,519
doing linear thinking. We have the

98
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,639
inductive reasoning machine to drive

99
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,280
through very very logical inference.

100
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,919
He's doing simulation. Basically, he

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,160
would have a mental word that allow him

102
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,560
to simulate all possible plans and ideas

103
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,199
and approaches before he even take a

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,840
single step and then he would be able to

105
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,800
choose the best scenario and then you

106
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,479
know action on it. And the reason he has

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
that capability is because he inherited

108
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,280
the all experiences and knowledges and

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
meaning data from his ancestor. And the

110
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,680
more he inherit the more simulation he

111
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,240
has and then the more power he can use

112
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,560
to solve problems. Right? So in the

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,440
world of psychology and philosophy there

114
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,040
is actually a term you know for such way

115
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,479
of thinking called the hypothetical

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
thinking. We actually do it all the

117
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,320
time. We say we do thought experiment.

118
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,720
That's exactly hypothetical thinking

119
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,199
right? I'm not sure that in our daily

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,360
research in fact talks that we heard

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,919
about we do thought experiments that

122
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,120
much. uh but uh uh what I'm going to

123
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,400
talk about today is to basically uh

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,880
build you know uh a system that

125
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
hopefully allow us to do simulational

126
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
thinking and thought experiment in the

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
world of biology. So in a sense the

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,000
project is about building such a

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,240
function which could be called a word

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,720
model you know if you are in a different

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,039
study domain but in here I call it a

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
virtual organism. It is a distribution

133
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,080
of the next state given the previous

134
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,680
state conditioning also action you take

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,440
which could be perturbation for example

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,479
knockouts and other things and um that's

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,479
here I want to uh conclude the primer

138
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,120
you know uh the models released like

139
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,560
this they are basically the same thing

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,960
trying to simulate phenomenons and the

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,759
possibilities in different uh space of

142
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,160
the word LM you know uh lives in the

143
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
space of language word models mod lives

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
in the space of a space and time and

145
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,120
agent models lives in the space of a

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,400
multi- agency and the ADO model that I'm

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,360
going to talk about lives in that space

148
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,520
of a physical biological word. So I'm

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,240
not trying to solve a model which make a

150
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,880
good prediction of herbivation outcome

151
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,759
or make a good prediction of a structure

152
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,280
given the sequence. These are

153
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,360
byproducts. The real goal is to be able

154
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,000
to simulate biology, you know, the way

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,319
that you would expect, you know, from a

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,840
natural creature. Uh but uh the goal of

157
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,160
uh explaining why you simulate that way,

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,400
what's the mechanism behind biology is

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,199
actually not in the goal. Okay, it is

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,560
not the purpose of such a project. So

161
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,360
with that I want to get started toward a

162
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,840
AIdriven digital organism using a

163
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,759
multi-skll foundational model approach.

164
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,560
So we've heard enough about this in the

165
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,120
past few days. The living creature is a

166
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,560
very very complex system. You know uh

167
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,759
highlighting multiscalability and the

168
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,680
multimodality and is a holistic system.

169
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,680
So I'm not going to say anything more

170
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,240
than that. You know you need to be able

171
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,319
to understand and process information

172
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,199
across the scale.

173
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,400
And that's actually not uh traditionally

174
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,080
even until now how biological science

175
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,039
and medical science are actually

176
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,280
positioned. You know for example you

177
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,560
know how do we study biology? If you are

178
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,639
given a piece of tissue which has a cell

179
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
you know uh we in our school we have the

180
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,039
department of cell biology and uh the

181
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,759
scientist would focus on that take data

182
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,240
in that domain and study that and there

183
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
is also a department of molecular

184
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,560
biology who goes down which I used to

185
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,560
get my PhD from and there is also

186
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
biochemistry which go even one level

187
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
down right if you want to go up you have

188
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,599
uh you know medicine if you go to a

189
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
hospital uh you see divisions organized

190
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,960
by organs

191
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Okay, if you have a liver problem,

192
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,240
you're going to that division and

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,479
therefore they're not looking at your

194
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,440
other organs and other tissues and other

195
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,720
things. And uh you know um we also have

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,280
public health and other things. Um but

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,080
uh we use the knowledge uh in those

198
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,280
research to solve say this kind of

199
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,479
problems drug design and target

200
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,599
discovery uh coming up with uh treatment

201
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,000
and so forth. So maybe you can already

202
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,159
ask yourself does the solution to each

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,120
of these problem exist in one of the

204
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,800
slides or not right maybe not right you

205
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,839
probably are expecting something like

206
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,479
this each of the problem cross basically

207
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,399
that sector or that silo that defines

208
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,880
our research discipline where we get

209
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,839
degree from which kind of force us to

210
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,240
look beyond where we are but our ability

211
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,839
to look beyond is limited by tools and

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
also by our brain power we may not be

213
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,640
able to source many knowledies And

214
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,640
that's where LLM all of a sudden kick in

215
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,000
because they seems to be a good tool at

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,440
least to begin with digesting and

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,120
consuming all knowledges right and uh it

218
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,480
is maybe also echoing that very you know

219
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,240
uh reality that every human health care

220
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
problem is essentially biological

221
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
problem. If you really talk about

222
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,640
someone being sick, you want to come up

223
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,600
with a design of the drug and antibbody,

224
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
it's not just you know uh a medical

225
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
problem anymore. You need to know the

226
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,399
biology you know at all scale anywhere

227
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,120
from molecular behavior to cellular

228
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,760
behavior to tissue to organ to organism.

229
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,040
Right? So if you really want to see your

230
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,560
answer in that holistic

231
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,800
context, I do see you know the need to

232
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,279
rethink about the tool we use which is

233
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,800
like this our classical mathematical

234
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,040
tools you know uh which uh you know uh

235
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,839
have been with us you know for decades

236
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,080
and uh and uh we spent career and life

237
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,399
you know uh developing higher and higher

238
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,080
version of that is actually of that

239
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,600
nature. It's uh under the principle of

240
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,320
one model for one problem with one data

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,640
set. That kind of specific design. In

242
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,760
fact, we are very proud of advocating

243
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,040
that spirit that you need to be very

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,959
specific. Okay? And you shouldn't be

245
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,440
trying to be a generalist because that's

246
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,440
going to uh cause you losing performance

247
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,399
and so forth. But in terms of

248
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,160
correctness and that that's second

249
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,560
issue. In the recent years you know uh

250
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,880
we see a new generation of technology

251
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,920
you know you know um you know maybe

252
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,920
featured with deep learning approaches

253
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,279
in the form of uh convolution neuronet

254
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,079
networks uh you know uh transformers and

255
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,720
uh now bigger foundation models. you

256
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,600
know um how are they going to be you

257
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,760
know uh maybe uh used you know uh maybe

258
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,160
in a different way to address the

259
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
problems that uh biologists and medical

260
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,680
practitioners might be interested. Well,

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
we see some very good success already,

262
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,200
right? So Arfold is one of the highlight

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,760
of uh uh using these new tools to uh

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,399
solve a uh you know um you know a very

265
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,360
very uh classic and difficult problem in

266
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,079
a very very impressive fashion and as a

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,560
result of that these days we see a boom

268
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,959
of foundation models you know you in

269
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,760
fact it's even more active than the

270
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:25,079
space of uh large language models and

271
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,000
the word models almost every week we see

272
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,560
announcement from certain labs you know,

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,279
of a new model, you know, in a

274
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,760
particular modality and so forth, right?

275
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,839
In fact, you may wonder why so quick

276
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,399
why, you know, you only see a foundation

277
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,399
model in the in uh in language and in

278
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,720
visual only from big companies and only

279
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,279
after a couple weeks or maybe a year and

280
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,720
why, you know, we can see uh biological

281
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,560
foundation models coming up every week.

282
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,560
Um in a sense, my humble opinion is that

283
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
these are not really foundation models.

284
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
Okay, these are transformer models uh

285
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,760
which are smallish specialized. It's

286
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,399
just a bigger uh classical tool happen

287
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,959
to be adopting the same architecture. Uh

288
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,000
you don't call a bicycle you know a real

289
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,760
kind of a same beast as a you know uh

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
you know a 18-wheeler even though they

291
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,000
all have the wheels. It's a small thing

292
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,600
and also the design philosophy probably

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,440
is also very different. For example, uh

294
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,639
imagine that uh uh we use a tool that we

295
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,639
are doing now to solve a simple, you

296
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,200
know, u say structure prediction

297
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,480
problem, right? You probably can see

298
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,720
that the structure prediction problem

299
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,800
right now is

300
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,839
happening out of the biological context.

301
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,720
You take a DNA uh amino acid sequence,

302
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,680
you put them into you know uh a may say

303
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,240
AF3 you know or other you know uh you

304
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,240
know u fundamental foundational model

305
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,880
tools and you get a stretch out of it.

306
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,079
Here I give a result for you. This is a

307
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,120
comparison of the ground truth of a

308
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,480
slightly complex structure prediction

309
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
problem which you need to consider

310
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,000
context. You are predicting the

311
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,880
structure of a antibbody in the presence

312
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,760
of a antigen. Therefore, you know, it's

313
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,120
not just about your amino acid sequence

314
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
determining the threedimensional

315
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,079
structure of uh a protein, but also it

316
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,839
needs to work, you know, on the antigen,

317
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,600
which actually will induce additional

318
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,000
structure, you know, consequence and so

319
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,639
forth. It turns out that the alpha 43

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,880
didn't do very well for this task. Okay,

321
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,720
this is the kind of complex prediction

322
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,160
problem. In fact, the problem can be

323
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,240
even trickier because uh not only your

324
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,560
uh uh structure needs to interact uh

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,839
properly with the antigen, it also

326
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,600
shouldn't interact with something

327
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,720
they're not supposed to interact with.

328
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,560
Therefore the offtarget problems the uh

329
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,639
non-specific uh prediction uh

330
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,200
interaction problems should also be in

331
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,600
context so that you don't trigger

332
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,000
toxicities and other side effects when

333
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,920
you deploy you know a molecular design.

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,959
So in a sense what I'm trying to say is

335
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,959
that uh even for a biological problem

336
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,600
which look as specific as a from

337
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,920
sequence to structure you need to

338
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,639
consider a much bigger context.

339
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,040
Therefore, that so-called one model per

340
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,040
one data set, you know, per one problem

341
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,720
kind of mindset isn't going to work very

342
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,000
well. Okay, for complex problem like

343
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,079
this, right? So, that's why when you say

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,839
you look at large language models, it

345
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,079
was never trained in this way. It is not

346
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,399
like a I train a large language model to

347
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,839
answer your Olympic math problem. I

348
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,160
train another model to answer your

349
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,800
reason problem. It begins the reverse

350
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,839
way. I train a generic general purpose

351
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,279
model which is humongous very very big

352
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,160
and they don't perform very well but

353
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,240
they actually does work for everything

354
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,480
and then only when you want to do your

355
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,040
math problem you want to do a financial

356
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,000
problem I specialize it and fine-tune it

357
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,399
that's the workflow in LM but uh in

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,240
biology we are not doing that we

359
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,600
actually are treating the foundation

360
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,199
model as a N2 already for a specific

361
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,279
problem and I feel a need to remind

362
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,519
everyone that this may be a problematic

363
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,760
we are missing opportunities. So in that

364
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,160
sense I would say uh not every

365
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,279
foundation model or state space models

366
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,720
or combinations is really truly

367
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,639
foundational. Okay. And the LM is never

368
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,120
meant to be you know uh doing that kind

369
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,519
of a task specific fashion. So then what

370
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,560
should we do? So that leads to uh you

371
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,720
know uh my uh very humble proposal where

372
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,320
I want to uh welcome some debates and

373
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,199
inputs. So we've got all this data right

374
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,399
you know uh this data include you know

375
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,040
uh multimodal data from a sequence to

376
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,160
structure to tabular record of

377
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,560
expression and to image to time series

378
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,880
and everything right and we've got all

379
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,720
these questions out there you know all

380
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,959
the way from designing a protein

381
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,320
structure reverse folding you know a

382
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,120
protein sequence and all the way up to I

383
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,839
don't know you know deploy a antigen or

384
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,759
a vaccine you know at the proper time at

385
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,519
a proper dosage to a proper population

386
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,040
and so forth. All these problems look

387
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,120
very different but they have a common

388
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,160
foundation of following some biological

389
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,880
principles and also they may be you know

390
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,079
uh reaching out to solutions that is at

391
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,959
this level connected right so in that

392
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,920
sense um what should be in the middle

393
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,000
should we see a jungle of spikes which

394
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,360
connects one thing here to one something

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,360
over there or do we maybe uh imagine

396
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,839
maybe a future solution that is more

397
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,040
modern down the road is taking a more

398
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,680
holistic approach. Right? So I believe

399
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,759
that there may be a opportunity to uh

400
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,600
think about a more unified and

401
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,639
integrative system for foundation models

402
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,839
biology where they can do one thing

403
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,759
right to simulate biological systems and

404
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
through that simulation hopefully you

405
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,560
can make predictions you can make

406
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,160
programmings and designs right so that's

407
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,120
a system where I call a digital organism

408
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,039
it is basically a computing system which

409
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,240
would empirically you know uh simulate

410
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:20,319
uh the phenomenon and outcome of uh a

411
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,720
living system upon any of your you know

412
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,959
legitimate and implementable you know uh

413
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,720
perturbations interferences as if you

414
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,280
are interacting with a real world

415
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,919
organisms. So I have some very very

416
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,000
strict definition here. It's not a

417
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,000
hypothetical thing. Say you do

418
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,320
everything for me. First of all, you

419
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,200
need to be able to ask and execute your

420
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,600
ask on that system. Don't basically try

421
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,160
something that is spiritual and say tell

422
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
me how do you work because uh this is

423
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
something that you cannot really you

424
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,799
know uh execute and implement. Right? So

425
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,320
typically you'll have a prompt which

426
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,720
could be a sequence, could be a

427
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,799
structure, could be a knockout, could be

428
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,960
some kind of perturbation and then the

429
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,280
system hopefully simulates your back you

430
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,320
know uh whatever consequences. So that's

431
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,480
a digital organism in my definition

432
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,559
which is not a digital twin. They don't

433
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,120
ne necessarily look like a cell but uh

434
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,960
the numbers that they give you may be

435
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,360
what you would expect from measuring a

436
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,760
real cell. And uh in the essence this uh

437
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,600
uh system is essentially mathematically

438
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,679
equivalent to such a conditional

439
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,679
distribution of the next state given the

440
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,679
previous state and also the action which

441
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,880
represents your perturbation. Right? So

442
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,919
uh the the uh the the the host just

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,880
introduced uh one of my function to be

444
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,039
uh the chief scientist of Jamba. Jamba

445
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,840
is a company that we actually recently

446
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,960
created exactly to execute that vision

447
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,200
because it requires not only you know uh

448
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,919
very very uh intense engineering work

449
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,960
but also resources and machines and so

450
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,240
forth. So Jamba's vision of a AIdriven

451
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:05,039
drogism is illustrated in here. It is a

452
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,240
holistic family of uh foundation models

453
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,760
each built on you know a different

454
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,160
biological data modality but they will

455
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,000
work together at some point you know to

456
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,880
deliver you know a holistic

457
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,720
multi-dimensional and multifaceted

458
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,160
functions and we are hoping that such a

459
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,440
system can be you know used to augment

460
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,720
not just a single slice but a uh

461
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,960
spectrum of um you know of uh um every

462
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,520
stage of uh processes in development

463
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,200
medicine. For example, nowadays you know

464
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,320
uh I remember uh very recently FDA just

465
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,960
announced that uh there is time maybe it

466
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,600
is time to start now uh stepping away

467
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,080
from using animals and the real systems

468
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,679
to do all the trials. How to make that

469
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,520
happen? Well, that means you need to do

470
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,160
something in a digital environment with

471
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,200
simulations. So that means you know uh

472
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,679
the AIdriven you know uh innovation in

473
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,520
medicine is not just about uh simulating

474
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,120
or designing a drug structure. You need

475
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,160
to also simulate an environment where

476
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,320
drug will be act on and uh hopefully

477
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,799
predict their consequences and you may

478
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,600
also be able to you know help designing

479
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,039
the trial you know given such context

480
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,720
make it more efficient and more

481
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,799
informative and maybe even help in

482
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,039
personalizing the outcomes. So we see

483
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:27,039
such a system called ADO you know

484
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:30,159
potentially uh uh usable for you know uh

485
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,080
needs of across the spectrum and our

486
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
dream is to really uh reach to this

487
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,640
point to close the loop of biological

488
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,039
study. In the past I was actually

489
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,039
trained as a biologist. I remember that

490
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,360
in my whole five years of pitch study I

491
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,760
studied the three genes you know uh and

492
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,039
uh um I was taking pride of being able

493
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,600
to pour a beautiful gel you know and and

494
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,760
get a sequence out of it and then we use

495
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,679
that method to basically do biological

496
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,000
exploration of hypothesis we basically

497
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,400
make hypothesis and we make some

498
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,760
constructs and uh and then we're going

499
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,080
to see in real life you know how uh that

500
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,880
uh you know uh perturbed system will

501
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,960
look like. This is a very expensive and

502
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,640
dangerous kind of uh experiment because

503
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
it's in the physical world. What if you

504
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,480
have a leak, you have a spill, right? So

505
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,400
I imagine with a AI system, the whole

506
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,880
workflow will be turned upside down.

507
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,840
We're going to probably you know spend

508
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,000
uh uh instead of uh now uh you know

509
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,840
using uh data and computer as an

510
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,799
afterthought but using them as the

511
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,320
primary filter you know uh to search the

512
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,240
hypothesis until you you know reach to a

513
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,240
few very highly plausible spa uh

514
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,799
hypothesis you know using computational

515
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,799
simulation and then you do a much more

516
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,039
guided and a small scale wab experiment

517
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,080
and then hopefully use that to include

518
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,440
data. So that's basically what a ADO

519
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,880
vision at very high level look like. Now

520
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,640
for the rest of the talk I'm going to

521
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,720
dive into the technical details and tell

522
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
you how such a system might be built.

523
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,520
It's a very complex system and for every

524
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,840
complex system you know uh if you take a

525
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,400
industrial view you have to basically

526
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,000
come up with a engineering road map and

527
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,039
our engineering road map is no different

528
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,520
from building a aircraft. just take into

529
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:20,080
parts and do distributed manufacturing

530
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,640
and then assemble and fine-tune.

531
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,440
So stage one very obviously it is where

532
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,559
we are now. Uh we divide and conquer.

533
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,360
Basically all these uh uh existing

534
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,440
efforts that we see in the literature in

535
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,200
a sense belongs to at this stage. You

536
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
are building modality specific

537
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,640
foundation models you know for DNA RNA

538
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:46,320
protein um you know uh RNA seek image

539
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,880
and so forth. Yeah. But uh why we need

540
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,640
to build that rather than just collect

541
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,960
them from literature because you know uh

542
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,600
we want to seize all these different

543
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,440
components first of all to be performant

544
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
but also to be ready to integrate

545
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,400
because to talk to each other so that uh

546
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,400
a problem can be addressed in a bigger

547
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,799
context and also information flow.

548
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
Therefore, our next step is to really

549
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,640
connect dots. And this is the

550
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,240
technically more interesting part

551
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,240
because uh you know uh different models

552
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,799
use different data and they have a

553
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,960
different representations you know of

554
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,039
different uh modality and maybe even of

555
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,240
the same modality. That creates you know

556
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,799
the need to seek alignments across

557
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,159
different modality to also evolve the

558
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,559
model continuously when you get more

559
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,640
information and also to maybe uh allow

560
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,039
you know arbitrary conditioning to be

561
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,520
incremented so that you can you know do

562
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,159
forward generation, reverse generation

563
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,480
or you know uh coming up with uh you

564
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,960
know uh correct responses to your

565
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,799
creative prompts you know say you know a

566
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,679
particular drug situation stretch

567
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,280
requirements

568
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,440
temperatures and so forth and then

569
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,919
cascade. Um maybe I should replace this

570
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,600
word with a little bit technical

571
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,640
description so that the people who are

572
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,240
here working on the models uh can maybe

573
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,880
uh appreciate the the the the substance

574
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,919
what is evolving. For example, you know,

575
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,679
uh you have a you know a language model

576
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,640
uh that's trained on uh unaligned

577
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,559
collection of sequences. Now what if I

578
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,559
give you additional information that uh

579
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,039
your sequence you know uh can be aligned

580
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,760
into multiple sequence alignment. Do you

581
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,080
retrain a model from scratch or do you

582
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
continue and how do you continue right?

583
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,919
So that's another interesting problem

584
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,480
and also maybe you get more data you

585
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,200
know of a completely different uh you

586
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,240
know distribution uh that you need to u

587
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,480
maybe uh take on a non-trivial way of

588
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
waiting them so that they don't uh spoil

589
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,880
the previous train models. So this is

590
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,240
evolving. You need to basically allow

591
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,440
the model to continuously receive new

592
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,400
information that is uh cleverly you know

593
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,640
engineered and formatted to you know

594
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,880
allow the model you know keep learning

595
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,799
without disrupting in the overall

596
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,120
architecture. I will give you a few

597
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,200
examples when I come to that point.

598
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,559
Second is about the alignment. Yeah, you

599
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,679
know, uh you your protein sequences come

600
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,679
from you know uh amino acid sequences

601
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,000
but also could come from the structure

602
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,880
tokenizations of structure you know

603
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,200
discrete motifs and uh uh can you

604
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,520
actually you know cross predict each

605
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,159
other so that your representation become

606
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,159
uh you know aligned and consistent. So

607
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,600
this is a art of alignment. It's like

608
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,520
you put two languages next to each

609
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,960
other. Therefore, your representation of

610
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,440
the language in the language model

611
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,679
become suddenly

612
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,120
connected. Uh conditioning you know I

613
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,000
don't need to say too much if you do

614
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,679
inverse folding your input a structure

615
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,039
then your production of the sequence

616
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
need to be conditioned as structure so

617
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,000
that they become consistent. So our goal

618
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,559
of course is to allow arbitrary you know

619
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,400
information to be encoded properly so

620
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,320
that they can be conditioned on. This is

621
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,640
particularly important when you do self

622
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,440
perturbation. How do you you know embed

623
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,159
and represent a perturbation or maybe a

624
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,919
knockout or genetic perturbation versus

625
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,120
drug perturbation? Right? All these uh

626
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,000
could leads to a new need of

627
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,279
architectural innovations. Cascading is

628
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
another interesting information that

629
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,120
actually maybe uh the one of the best

630
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,520
justification of having all these

631
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,799
different models in the same place. Why?

632
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,440
For example, when you build a cell

633
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,720
model, how these days people build a

634
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,679
cell model? Well, you use a table of uh

635
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,279
RNA seek data and therefore you train

636
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,080
you know uh a model uh using uh such uh

637
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,840
tabular information as the input and how

638
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,159
do you represent your gene? Well, a gene

639
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,279
in those models is ID. The ID could be

640
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,640
ABC could be 1 2 3. It's a code number

641
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,760
that is not carrying biological

642
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,200
meanings. But a gene has DNA sequence. A

643
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
gene encodes a protein which has

644
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,279
structures. How do you put all those

645
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,200
information you know uh into the

646
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,279
learning so that they carry you know

647
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,520
both you know uh just a uh a information

648
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,679
that tell them apart but in addition

649
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,200
their actual functionality. Well, you

650
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,799
can imagine once you have a DNA

651
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,320
foundation model, once you have a

652
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,320
protein foundation model, you can

653
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,159
extract representations of every gene

654
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,039
and every protein from those models and

655
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,960
use them to represent the genes, the

656
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,720
protein uh the gene the genes in the in

657
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,960
the cell model and that cell model

658
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,799
itself actually could return you a

659
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,120
representation of a whole cell which can

660
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,200
be used in the next level of modeling

661
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,200
say a tissue in our organism. Right?

662
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,200
That's how you see the cascading can

663
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
happen continuously you know top down

664
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,320
and bottom up.

665
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,720
Once you have that we can write at the

666
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,120
age uh where uh you need to do optimal

667
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,559
alignment and uh across the scale. It's

668
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,720
just like when you assemble all the

669
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,159
parts into a aircraft you still need to

670
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
do a lot of fine tuning to make them

671
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,919
harmonic and working together. So in

672
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,919
here that pose another technique

673
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,159
challenge because that means you need to

674
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,000
be able to co-rain now multiple models

675
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,399
at the same time so that the gradient

676
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,120
can flow across modality and across

677
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,440
model modules and also there are

678
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,360
additional consistencies to be honored

679
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,360
you know in this finetuning. So that's

680
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,840
roughly the three stages that we are

681
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,600
using right now to train the ADO model.

682
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,320
There are again you know a good number

683
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,880
of technical you know uh challenges that

684
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,039
we are working on both front end and the

685
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,159
back end. I just want to name a few. On

686
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,000
the back end these models are bigger

687
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,640
models. I'm going to have a graph with

688
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,039
you showing you that why you know we are

689
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,960
not at the optimum spot yet even in

690
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,360
terms of model size. Therefore that

691
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,399
involves you know uh handling long

692
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,600
context you know million or maybe longer

693
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:51,120
and running on tens of uh hundreds if

694
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,919
not thousands of uh GPUs and uh doing

695
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,000
proper paralizations doing proper uh

696
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:01,360
discretization quantization and uh and

697
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,600
and uh and uh other type of projection.

698
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,360
So these are you know uh the level of uh

699
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,480
you know engineering work on the back

700
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,320
end. Then on the model part the need to

701
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,840
invent new representations you know for

702
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,240
biological information which is the

703
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,760
business called tokenization is not end

704
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,880
yet. Right now in fact we don't have a

705
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,440
lot of uh new ideas coming straight out

706
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,200
of biology in treating biological data.

707
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,440
We basically borrow all the ideas from

708
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,279
NLP which was meant for you know

709
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,120
cognitive languages not for biological

710
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,600
languages. Therefore you can imagine

711
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,360
there is a big room there to improve our

712
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,200
current way of representing even

713
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,480
biological information in the form of

714
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,720
tokens and then positional encoding.

715
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,200
What does it mean you know uh by

716
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,440
position you know uh in a biological

717
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
token you know in the language is very

718
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,679
obvious is the position of your word

719
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,200
inside a sequence but in biology that

720
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,679
kind of assumption is not there.

721
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,520
Therefore, right now we see many trivial

722
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,600
treatment of positional encoding which

723
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,799
actually lose huge opportunities in

724
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:08,240
capturing additional informations and uh

725
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,640
also you know uh you know uh training

726
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,399
strategies do you still want to do the

727
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,640
missing token partition training or you

728
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,320
use contrastive training and so forth

729
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,399
again that gives you additional

730
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,520
dimension to make the model perform

731
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:24,880
better inference how do you use the

732
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,799
model after it's trained and uh I I

733
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,440
think especially in those generation

734
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,520
task where you need to you know have a

735
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,480
particular structure uh serving

736
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,880
particular goal in the space of doing

737
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,279
agentic and the word models now one of

738
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,240
the trendy term is called the purposeful

739
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,399
reasoning and the purposeful planning so

740
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,240
that's another idea that is not very

741
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,559
often practiced right now in here in

742
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
biology what's the purpose you know of a

743
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,880
design in biological world how to encode

744
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,200
our purposes so I meant to say that it's

745
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,200
a very very exciting field that is

746
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,360
almost empty at this point in terms of

747
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,360
technical new ideas. So uh both for

748
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,320
machine learning people and also for

749
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,559
comb biologist you know it's a gold mine

750
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,520
you know for us to uh discover you know

751
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,760
new technologies and new advancement and

752
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,440
now of course there is a huge need there

753
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,200
for soft engineering you know in the

754
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,279
space of we talk about the megatron

755
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,279
database we talk about the deep speed

756
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,320
all these other things in here the

757
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,840
tooling of uh you know LM of biological

758
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,159
modeling is really really chaotic right

759
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,679
now I saw a few presentations today and

760
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,520
yesterday mentioning about certain

761
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,760
companies is already making that effort.

762
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,039
It's nice to see more of that coming out

763
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,760
of of our work. So, just to report some

764
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,000
preliminary results before I end, we

765
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,960
were able to publish, you know, a good

766
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,120
uh collection of u train pre-trained

767
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,279
models already in the past few months.

768
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,080
And if you go back to this graph, all

769
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,159
these little components uh with a check

770
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,720
mark uh already has a model released and

771
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,919
some released more than once already.

772
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,320
And uh uh of course you know uh they are

773
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,399
evaluated very exhaustively over uh

774
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,640
hundreds of different downstream tasks

775
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,480
to make sure that they you know are

776
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,679
performant and also

777
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,440
consistent what we do with all these

778
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,120
models what have been happening you know

779
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,360
in developing this. So here are some

780
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,840
technical insights. First of all, I want

781
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,159
to report that we did scaling law for

782
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,799
many of these models and we found that

783
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,360
even with the current data, okay, the

784
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,200
model size isn't saturating yet. You

785
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,720
still have the room to push up the

786
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
performance of the model just by making

787
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,799
the model bigger. That's like know very

788
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,880
very low hanging fruit uh that we can

789
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,279
try. Of course, it requires capital and

790
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,360
engineering capabilities. There are some

791
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,080
more interesting technical advancements

792
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,159
which I'm going to quickly list out. uh

793
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,720
for example you know uh in this ADO

794
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,919
protein model we start to see you know

795
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,480
uh the opportunity of uh uh very very uh

796
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,120
deploying you know diverse pre-training

797
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,039
strategies you know to constantly

798
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,799
continuously boost the model performance

799
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,799
so in this particular production of the

800
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,919
protein language models we started from

801
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,399
single sequences and then you add MSA

802
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,679
the MSA actually can be actually treated

803
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,519
as a single sequence if you inject a

804
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,080
positional encoding which indicates the

805
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,760
evolution position of every sequence and

806
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,320
then put them back. They remember not

807
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,080
only who you are but also where you are

808
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,480
from the evolution history and that

809
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,120
essentially turn a previously single

810
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,840
sequence based RLM into you know a model

811
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,159
which based on MSA. You can then inject

812
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,039
stratization to further improve. You can

813
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,880
then play with uh uh data reweing

814
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,120
temperature analing and many other

815
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,799
tricks to constantly push up. So you can

816
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,960
see this curve you know is still not

817
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,279
stopping yet which actually gets us to a

818
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,640
point where we can outperform models

819
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,840
like AF3 ESM quite significantly you

820
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,279
know over protein function

821
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,039
predictions in another model which we

822
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,360
called uh 80 fold uh again a combination

823
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,440
of different ideas you know really can

824
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,120
leads to a quite strong results I

825
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,440
mentioned about the prediction problem

826
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,079
out of context and here's how we did it

827
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,480
first of all we rely on a much much more

828
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,879
powerful for protein language model that

829
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,040
features ideas like multiple sequence

830
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,520
alignment slate training a mixture of

831
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,839
experts to allow you addressing

832
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,639
different model modality rack you know

833
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,800
to uh really allow you to focus on you

834
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,200
know connected data and then you know

835
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,679
some diffusion process you know to allow

836
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,599
you you know simulating structures and

837
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,159
uh we found that with this combination

838
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,960
we were able to actually predict you

839
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,119
know a complex antigen antibbody

840
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,760
structure you know in a much much uh

841
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,040
higher quality than existing models. In

842
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,440
particular, if you look at these three

843
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,919
graphs, this is the prediction quality

844
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,280
comparison between us and alpha fold and

845
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,639
another model um you know over uh only

846
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,399
antibbody which is basically a one

847
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:59,440
complex stretch pretty problem and then

848
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,440
in here the the the the task is

849
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,280
performed on antigen and antibbody

850
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,040
complex and you can see the improvement

851
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,960
is now over 20%. And also nanogen and

852
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,880
nanobbody and antibbody stretch

853
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,720
prediction also is a hard one. We can do

854
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,560
much better than ex models. Basically

855
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,560
the the harder the problem the better

856
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,680
improvement you can get from such a

857
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,720
slightly more complex

858
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,520
systems. Uh yet another uh innovation uh

859
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,760
related to the the diffusion based uh

860
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,160
generative models. Um here um again you

861
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,000
know you can see that uh we implemented

862
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,640
a pipeline which allow you to uh do uh

863
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,560
reverse folding you know of uh uh the

864
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,800
protein structure you know given you

865
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,200
know a a target say generate something

866
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,480
that binds this particular structure. We

867
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,160
found that uh uh our system was able to

868
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,839
generate a much more realistic

869
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,079
distribution you know of the protein

870
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,800
structure. So here's a comparison. This

871
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,560
red curve is the distribution of native

872
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,280
proteins in terms of the proportion of

873
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,200
alpha helix and beta sheets. This red

874
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,599
curve is the distribution of the

875
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,280
generated products from David Baker's

876
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
group. And here you have another

877
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,960
function. You can see that they are very

878
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,680
far away from this red thing. Right? And

879
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,359
this blue curve is the generative

880
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,000
distribution from uh the ado diff gem

881
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,680
which appear to be a lot more uh

882
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,480
faithful to the biological

883
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,280
reality. One more is uh on the ado

884
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,480
tissue model uh we built a cell and

885
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,640
tissue model which can be tested on

886
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,480
problems like niche prediction. But the

887
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,280
way do that is uh more than just

888
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,320
building a cell model you know uh with

889
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,560
single cell uh RNC data. We actually use

890
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,720
uh another new technique called the two

891
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,800
dimensional positional encoding. So that

892
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,119
whenever you know you want to build a

893
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,680
representation into the prediction you

894
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,920
take not only the cell itself you also

895
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,760
take the cell information embedding from

896
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,119
a neighboring thing. your basically your

897
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,200
neighborhoods you know which are

898
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,880
connected you know to you will all be

899
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,720
incorporated into a much larger

900
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,119
representation so that you have the

901
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,079
context you know into that. Therefore in

902
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,960
training this model every count is not

903
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,320
just from one cell but also the cell in

904
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,320
the neighborhood properly positionally

905
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,960
encoded. Last but not least we actually

906
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,240
could use this entire idea of foundation

907
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,200
models to redefine some classical

908
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,960
practice such as gwas. Right? So in JAS

909
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,520
you know it's a very very important

910
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,240
field in medicine but it's also really

911
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,680
you know you know hampered by technical

912
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,920
difficulties. You cannot for example

913
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,200
work with a very fancy phenotypes such

914
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,680
as a time series. You also rely on very

915
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,720
very statistically weak data in the form

916
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,119
of snips right but now with a foundation

917
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,880
model that works across modality. First

918
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,359
of all, you can turn your complex

919
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,760
phenotype such as a image, such as a

920
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,160
time series into a vector representation

921
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,839
using the foundational model embedding.

922
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,720
You can also turn the genomic

923
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,400
information into a continuous vector

924
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,760
which can find separate all the

925
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,160
polymorphisms and the behaviors and

926
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,760
patterns in your genetics in the form of

927
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,240
a vector and then at the end of day what

928
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,760
you do is vector to vector association

929
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,040
analysis which is a multi-dimensional

930
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,880
regression problem using classical

931
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,839
approaches. So that kind of opens up the

932
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,240
way of you know arbitrary flexibility of

933
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,560
working with different type of uh

934
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,320
phenotype modality and also genotypic

935
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,800
and molecular polymorphisms.

936
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,920
And all the uh results I just talked

937
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,880
about are actually uh packaged you know

938
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,680
uh in you know a uh nicely structured uh

939
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,240
software stack uh where we uh regularly

940
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,440
release in hugging face and in GitHub

941
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,520
and you are welcome to uh to try out and

942
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,599
to uh give us feedbacks. I think

943
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,720
recently you know we we've been uh keep

944
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,480
an eye on the the downloads. It seems to

945
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,720
be picking up quite nicely with

946
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,480
thousands of uh you know downloads uh in

947
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,040
certain models. So I definitely

948
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:09,680
encourage you to take a look. So to wrap

949
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:13,599
up, I think I'm maybe uh you know uh uh

950
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,200
sending uh some uh slightly

951
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,200
controversial messages in here in terms

952
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,000
of my methodology belief, right? Because

953
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,960
we were trained as scientists and uh we

954
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,880
believe in ration and the math and the

955
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,040
first principle was supposed to be like

956
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,640
Newton, you know, writing the laws and

957
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,240
predicting the objects and so forth.

958
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,800
That's actually where you know

959
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,119
scientists you know really hold uh very

960
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,960
secret about but I want to say that this

961
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,960
may not be the only way to do science

962
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,880
because uh even in science there are

963
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,800
many phenomenons which is defining

964
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,040
causality in a traditional way here I

965
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,599
just give you a few examples you know

966
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,440
you know if you you are a believer of a

967
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,680
general theory of relativity then there

968
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,599
is a phenomenon called time travel

969
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,000
therefore what is causing what is

970
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,320
unclear there okay quantum superposition

971
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,760
is Another problem only when you observe

972
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,200
you know uh the final consequences

973
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,280
otherwise there are parallel universe

974
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,200
out therefore there's no causality right

975
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,359
and the evolution also is not causal by

976
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,000
the way we are not the perfect design of

977
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,640
the god okay we are the the the outcome

978
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,599
of you know a random mutation plus

979
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,079
directional selection therefore even in

980
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,480
nature you know uh it's a hypothetical

981
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,200
thinking type of you know process rather

982
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,280
than a direct design I want to design a

983
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,680
creature which lives in the mountain of

984
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,880
ops That's not the way we evolve, right?

985
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,240
So I just want to you know uh you know

986
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,320
uh maybe uh uh stress that there is a

987
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,000
room for us to be a little bit r less

988
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,760
rational and more empirical and that

989
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,920
basically comes to the conclusion

990
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,400
between the two kinds of school right

991
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,800
now you know countism you know is you

992
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,359
know maybe uh you know the kind of a

993
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,280
guiding principle you know uh for much

994
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,760
of the scientists they ask always ask

995
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,800
why and uh can you explain to me this

996
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,079
and I need to have a pure total clarity

997
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,079
and causality

998
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,480
before I can believe you know and move

999
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,720
on. But uh in humanism you know uh you

1000
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,240
you can take your face on data and

1001
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,319
empirical results before you even

1002
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,040
understand what's going on there. That's

1003
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,520
actually what's uh inside LLM and large

1004
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,240
language models and FMs. We actually

1005
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,760
honestly don't know exactly you know the

1006
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,240
reasoning path and everything inside

1007
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,560
that but it doesn't m hurt us from using

1008
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,560
that. At least in biology I find one

1009
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,720
example similar. the invention of the

1010
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,200
vaccine is like that when it is invented

1011
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,359
we don't actually know DNA RNA we don't

1012
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,920
know at all why it is working but it

1013
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,720
worked and then people used it right so

1014
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,839
I hope that uh uh we can take the same

1015
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,040
kind of uh approach in here with the

1016
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:50,640
availability of foundation models which

1017
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,800
does job like this instead of this I

1018
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,359
would like to have in a position where

1019
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,680
we have a periodic table and predict the

1020
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,400
compound you know when we mix

1021
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,000
But uh I guess uh even if uh uh the FM

1022
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,760
based approach, the deep learning based

1023
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
approach, the AI approach you know are

1024
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,800
not quite there, it doesn't you know

1025
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,760
prevent us from uh using it to do you

1026
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,440
know uh you know uh to make progress. So

1027
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:21,280
with that I want to return to uh the

1028
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,359
initial vision. Ado is one of these uh

1029
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,599
simulator you know of the biological

1030
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,920
world allowing all these phenomenons to

1031
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,920
be simulated and some of them to be

1032
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,960
programmed and predicted and uh there is

1033
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,200
a potential that uh such a system could

1034
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,599
be you know a paradigm for holistic and

1035
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,119
incitical science where you carry out

1036
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,599
your virtual web lab you carry out your

1037
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,960
virtual trial and then you do you know

1038
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,520
maybe pandemic simulation using a

1039
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,200
simulation system like that like what we

1040
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,560
actually see in many other domain in

1041
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,359
physics in semiconductor in agriculture

1042
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,440
in many other places it is happening or

1043
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,079
it happened for a long time biology is

1044
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,000
one of the last place where we are very

1045
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,760
very heavily still you know relying on

1046
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,359
wab and uh uh I imagine a change uh

1047
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,839
toward a modern approach is needed with

1048
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,170
that I want to conclude my presentation

1049
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,999
thank you for the attention

1050
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:22,999
[Applause]

1051
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,640
Thanks for your inspiring talk, Eric.

1052
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,640
And we'll have time for one question.

1053
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,680
Hi, thank you for the talk. Uh, I have a

1054
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,319
question. Have you faced any challenges

1055
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,480
in terms of evaluation benchmarks? I

1056
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,480
would assume this is like an over idea

1057
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,240
you are exploring and I would assume you

1058
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,319
have faced some challenges that are you

1059
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,560
working on to creating new benchmarks

1060
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,960
for this task. Thank you. Great

1061
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,520
question. So uh uh fortunately you know

1062
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,079
uh just like uh you know in uh uh

1063
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,160
imageet in a biological world we have so

1064
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,000
protein gene from debra you know which

1065
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,839
gives you already hundreds of downstream

1066
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,480
benchmark tests. So we use that. Okay.

1067
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,960
And uh I think there is always a need

1068
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,000
for the community to share and publish

1069
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,119
more standardized benchmark test. But uh

1070
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,200
there is a twist going forward. These

1071
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,760
benchmarks were designed with the old

1072
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,000
mindset of having new tools delivering

1073
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,680
old functionality. They may be not

1074
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,400
strong enough to test the future

1075
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,560
systems. Therefore, I think with the

1076
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,920
evolution of new systems like this

1077
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,680
coming out, uh there may be a space to

1078
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,400
think even harder to come up with

1079
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,960
additional uh stronger test and more

1080
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,800
difficult problems. So, that's uh uh of

1081
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,280
course, you know, uh our company, my

1082
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,400
team is uh very committed, you know, to

1083
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,040
uh publish and to share uh not just the

1084
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,800
benchmark uh data and test actually the

1085
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,079
benchmark tool. You need to have the

1086
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,400
right tool to plug in your data and run

1087
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,240
the experiment and even that right now

1088
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,319
is not very standardized. This is not

1089
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,319
like you have a chatbot arena you know

1090
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,480
in LM which actually was built by my

1091
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,119
group. Everybody go there using the same

1092
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,760
platform you know to fairly compare. I

1093
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,119
think this is a emerging need that we

1094
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,119
need to address in our biological

1095
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,119
community.

1096
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:22,800
Thanks a model. There's a you know very

1097
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:26,400
nice presentation and you have wonderful

1098
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:30,280
you know very platform but you know um

1099
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:33,240
not all health issues are

1100
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,680
biological

1101
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:39,440
bios in three dimensions where like

1102
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,960
addictions you know can only account the

1103
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:46,440
genetic only account for to

1104
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:50,960
60% and you know guided

1105
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,960
environment all the

1106
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:59,160
patient would like to

1107
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,160
entertain a model.

1108
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,599
Thank you for the question. If you look

1109
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,760
at this graph, uh this is not meant to

1110
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,200
be, you know, setting already the

1111
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,760
limitation of the data we're going to

1112
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,400
use. These are examples of the data we

1113
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,440
have and if more data is going to be

1114
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,319
available such as epigenetic, such as

1115
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,839
environmental, of course, we're going to

1116
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,720
use it. The key question is that do you

1117
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,119
already design a architecture that is uh

1118
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,839
you know uh you know uh you know maybe

1119
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,480
uh ready in advance for taking those big

1120
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,000
data new data or do you just plug one

1121
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,119
after another right so this is a

1122
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,920
technical question we don't have an

1123
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,480
answer yet but uh if you look at the uh

1124
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,359
the practice in large language models

1125
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,839
and in large visual models these days um

1126
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,920
the attitude over there on data is very

1127
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,240
different from biologist I keep hearing

1128
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,240
in biological domain People say we need

1129
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,079
to have a high quality data. We need to

1130
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,839
curate the data and we need to do

1131
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,760
something something. I have a

1132
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,920
drastically opposite opinion. Maybe just

1133
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,920
to be psychotadic. All data is data.

1134
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,319
Wrong data is data. Dirty data is data.

1135
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,480
They carry informations and they if they

1136
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,000
reflect a flaw in the experiments in the

1137
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,400
collection that is something you want to

1138
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,960
learn as well. Therefore in language for

1139
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,760
example they just take everything okay

1140
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,520
and let the machine the system to try

1141
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,079
come up with their own internal

1142
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,400
connectivity and coherence and then give

1143
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:28,319
you the simulation. I think in biology

1144
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,200
if you take a open view like this to try

1145
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,160
make the model larger and make the model

1146
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,200
inclusive of all data that might be you

1147
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,599
know you know a opportunity to uh see uh

1148
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,599
certain emergent properties.

1149
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,280
We'll unfortunately have to move it on

1150
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,960
to the discussion. Thank you very much.

1151
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,119
Sorry for taking your time. Thank you.

1152
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,119
Thank you.
