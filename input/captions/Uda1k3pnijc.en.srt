1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,559
yeah we just did the quiz and that's for

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,040
people who are watching this later

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,359
that's not on the video we're going to

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,760
do some introduction to music cognition

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,199
I don't think we're going to have time

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,240
but um we can also unlock voice leading

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,439
if we do now I'm going to put this

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,080
down great and I'm going to turn off

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,599
these

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,960
it's

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,239
okay turn off that is that okay yeah

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,480
that's better um great so music

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,480
cognition is one of these um things that

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,239
intersects with huge numbers of parts of

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,920
Music um in general music theory with

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,079
music history with performance with um

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,600
you know performance anxiety all these

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,600
things uh but it also has a big impact

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,199
on computational music especially

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,800
computational music theory um it sort of

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,920
formed this field and it continues to be

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,520
part of it I just want to uh give a

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,960
little introduction from uh professor of

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,600
Music cognition at uh Northeastern down

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,759
street and also Wesleyan uh psyche Louie

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,560
um just a couple minutes while I also

27
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,280
check to make sure I have the we we'll

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,759
see if the sound's still working

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,759
consider for instance this musical

30
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,759
example all right you might say that

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,119
sounds nice and normal kind of like

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,560
saying um I took the T here

33
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,560
today what about

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,360
this right if you think that sounded

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
normal you can come talk to me

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,840
afterwards and we might sign you up for

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,520
that tone deafness study we're doing

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,799
um now so when you heard that last core

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,079
your brain does a double take right

40
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,520
there's something about it that that's

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,240
like saying I took the T here octopus

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,920
nothing wrong with octopus but it just

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,520
doesn't fit the context of what happened

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,159
before it it doesn't fit the grammar now

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,560
this double take that your brain dust

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,320
can be measured using electrical

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,039
potentials on the surface of the scalp

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,080
this is a picture of my mom and getting

49
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,400
her brain potentials recorded and she's

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,319
got 64 electrodes on her cap there and

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,720
what those do is make recordings like

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,239
this so on the left I'm showing you our

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,080
brain responses to expected and

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
unexpected musical chords and and on the

55
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,400
right I'm showing you the the difference

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
between expected and unexpected on the

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
surface of the scalp so there's a bird

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
ey view of the scalp so right away you

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,720
can see that 200 milliseconds after the

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,239
on of the unexpected cord your brain is

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,280
doing this double take right saying oh

62
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,120
that was unexpected 500 milliseconds you

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,200
get um the brain saying oh how do I

64
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,040
integrate that into what happened

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,040
before so this is telling us with

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,680
millisecond accuracy that we know about

67
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,120
music there's something about our brains

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,879
that is very sensitive to what's

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
grammatical um in western music so the

70
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,000
question is where does this knowledge

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
come from how do we come to know what we

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,519
know so to answer that question we again

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,319
have to go all the way back to the

74
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,080
ancient Greeks Pythagoras found that if

75
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,720
two strings are being played together

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,360
where one string is twice the length of

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,560
the other um those two sound good

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,400
together they sound consonant so this

79
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,760
2:1 frequency ratio um is what

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,000
supposedly brought us closer to the

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,120
Greek gods in fact the word Symphony um

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,799
originally means vibrating in Perfect

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,440
Harmony using these mathematical integer

84
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,040
ratios so this 2:1 frequency ratio is

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,840
true of music all around the world now

86
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,760
different cultures divide that 2 to1 fre

87
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,319
queny ratio in different ways and our

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,720
culture the equal tempered Western

89
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,090
chromatic scale divides them in 12 steps

90
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,930
so this is how it

91
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,529
[Laughter]

92
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,529
[Music]

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,080
sounds okay then these two guys came

94
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,560
along and said does it have to be this

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,720
way why 2:1 why not 3:1 so the bowl and

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,920
Pier scale is based on a 3:1 frequency

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,239
ratio and within that we've got 13

98
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,400
logarithmic divisions of that scale so

99
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,280
you still get get some mathematical

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,840
inter ratio so the Greek gods are not

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,239
offended here um but what this sounds

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,480
like is completely different from

103
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,430
Western or other types of

104
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,439
[Laughter]

105
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,439
[Music]

106
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,000
music so this is a really powerful

107
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,199
approach um to find out what people know

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,280
about music in the laboratory so we can

109
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,919
be pretty sure that people have never

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,280
heard this music before but when they

111
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,800
come in then they can listen to this

112
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,360
music for a while and then we can

113
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,520
measure how they come to know what they

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,960
know so I'm going to play you for about

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,840
a minute um a snippet of a piece by

116
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,280
Stephen ye it's called reminiscences and

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,200
it's written in the bow and Pier scale

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:58,850
just so you get an idea

119
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:58,850
[Music]

120
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:29,370
[Music]

121
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,680
so this really is kind of an

122
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,759
otherworldly new musical experience that

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,319
we're entering here um and in our lab

124
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,240
what we wanted to do was figure out how

125
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,919
people learn this new musical system so

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,670
we have these well-controlled Melodies

127
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,120
that people listen to for about half an

128
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,240
[Music]

129
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,479
hour so you listen to these things for

130
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,960
half an hour and they're they're defined

131
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,240
using rules and principles or

132
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,919
grammatical structures that we've

133
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,479
defined ourselves and then the question

134
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,520
is what can people learn from this new

135
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,880
musical experience first thing we found

136
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,960
was that memory increases with with

137
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,120
repetition turns out also that

138
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,319
preference increases with repetition so

139
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,639
what we're seeing here is the beginning

140
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,800
of musical taste right the more you

141
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,599
listen to something the more you begin

142
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,199
to like it but what I'm interested in is

143
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,759
how learning occurs and it turns out

144
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,880
that learning does not occur with

145
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,479
repetition but with variability in other

146
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,000
words the more different ways you tell

147
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,160
people something the more people are

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,639
able to infer the underlying structure

149
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,639
of what you tell them and then to

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,560
generalize those to new instances of the

151
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,039
same grammar now our question becomes

152
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,240
now

153
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,639
and that's where I stop for here because

154
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,479
we can look at that online and I want

155
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,199
you to um just get as excited um for our

156
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,720
two two guest speakers who are going to

157
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,000
be um talking on zoom on Friday and

158
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,280
after um after break uh here on campus

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,160
so we're going to be talking uh

160
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,880
primarily in the next couple classes

161
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,280
about uh the work well first clar Arthur

162
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,120
is going to present her own work and

163
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,840
then we'll be talking about two um major

164
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,800
figures uh in music cognition one is uh

165
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,120
Carol Kum hunel and uh her Landmark book

166
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,080
cognitive foundations of musical pitch

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,440
which is all about how do we process

168
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,039
pitch how do we think how do we put it

169
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,720
into particular areas and so that's

170
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,520
pretty important for music cognition but

171
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,039
it's also formed her work on this formed

172
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,919
the basis for every

173
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,479
computational almost every for the I

174
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,000
yeah I can't say the wrong things uh for

175
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,879
the most widely used key detection in

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,879
key algorithm finding um mechanisms so

177
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:40,400
here uh this is our favorite bwv

178
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,800
66.6 looking at different sizes of

179
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,159
amount of memory that we have and we can

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,520
see that um where is at certain um

181
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:53,400
things a major is coming up and and then

182
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,400
we're moving from one key to another as

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,280
uh as our cognition goes so we'll be

184
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:03,000
looking into um her

185
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,759
work the second uh major figure is um

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,159
David hiron whose name might have

187
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,919
appeared um as a secondary author of one

188
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,879
of the um articles that you may have

189
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,879
discussed on the midterm um in his his

190
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,199
um Landmark book sweet anticipation

191
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,280
music and the psychology of expectation

192
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,199
you're going to have access to this book

193
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:28,800
um totally on the website um in uh by

194
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,159
Friday and um but it's I I feel like if

195
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,080
there's one

196
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,279
thing worth spending your money to own

197
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,000
in sort of a physical copy coming out of

198
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,159
this class it's this book first off it's

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,200
not too expensive it's like 22 bucks or

200
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,320
something but it's just um amazing the

201
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,680
types of things uh and talks about his

202
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,839
own work but mostly it's a collection of

203
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,920
sort of the greatest hits of Music

204
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,040
cognition also by others um and so this

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,200
is a particular experiment that I think

206
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,000
is really great um Bolognese musicians

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,640
and American musicians were given uh a

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,880
banese Melody that was there and then

209
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,120
they were betting um on whether or not I

210
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,640
believe it was the next note goes up or

211
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,480
down after that and you see The

212
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,360
Bolognese musician and so this is how

213
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,360
uncertain they are so lower is more

214
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,800
certain the Bales musicians when they

215
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,240
hear this traditional Bolognese thing

216
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
they're they're just doing great they're

217
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,640
they're making money head over heels and

218
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,680
then uncertainty goes up when it goes

219
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,880
into a different direction CU this was a

220
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,200
crafted Melody designed to

221
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,040
uh do that and so being able to check

222
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,480
out things like that we'll also be

223
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,320
looking um a little bit at Rhythm and

224
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,920
rhythmic uncertainty um and the types of

225
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,240
things that um that music cognition

226
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,040
might tell us for how to generate Rhythm

227
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,959
so this is a this is a particularly um

228
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,000
slightly complex graph but um but it's

229
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,560
actually I think it's the simplest way

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,200
to explain this diagram say you have um

231
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,200
you have three

232
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,160
notes whatever three notes they

233
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,720
are say that their total duration sum up

234
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,200
to

235
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,000
one and then you can figure out how much

236
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,279
what percentage or what fraction of the

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
duration each of the notes takes up oh

238
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:28,120
gosh uh let's see that's 1 half what's

239
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,040
that that's 38 thank you and it's 1/8 um

240
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,120
and then you can place each of them

241
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,760
between one and zero on this chart and

242
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,720
this triangular chart lets you uh show

243
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,079
the proportion of each of three things

244
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,720
at the same time and one of the things

245
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,160
that comes out of this oh I did um is

246
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,440
that there's not one point where people

247
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,880
perceive so so there's one point where

248
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:56,639
it should be exactly right so 314 uh 211

249
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,600
should be exactly here on the 25% AIS

250
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,680
for one on the 25% access for another

251
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,680
and the 50% for a third one so it should

252
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,000
be right here and

253
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,079
314 um I guess in this way 38 1/8 48

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,240
should be right here and one of the

255
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,000
things that cognitive um studies has

256
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,279
shown is that people perceive things a

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,720
little bit differently so this entire

258
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:25,839
region of playing is perceived in this

259
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,440
experiment as the 211 or 1/2 1/4 1 qu

260
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,279
whereas the region that was perceived as

261
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:37,320
314 four is actually does not include

262
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:40,279
the mathematically correct 38 1/8 uh

263
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,720
48 and so we'll look at experiments that

264
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,720
try to charart the whole landscape of

265
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,360
rhythmic perception and you can imagine

266
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,480
that that could also be useful if you're

267
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,000
generating music that when you generate

268
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
patterns and you want people to hear

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,800
them and you don't want it to sound

270
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
computer you might do something else um

271
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,639
but by far the tit the title of the book

272
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,120
is called sweet anticipation and by far

273
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,600
I think the most interesting for me part

274
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,440
of this is studying anticipation

275
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,920
expectation and surprise and so I was

276
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,959
playing um when you all walked in a

277
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:19,760
piece by um Peter shley uh PDQ Bach um

278
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:22,120
fake Bach humorist and what I love is a

279
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,839
little experiment here where it's we're

280
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,240
going to be playing something that

281
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,680
breaks expectations now you'll hear some

282
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,800
laughter on the soundtrack that's

283
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,320
probably also physical cool things are

284
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,279
happening on stage that we can't see

285
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,079
because it's just an audio version but

286
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:39,800
listen to what people find funny

287
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,279
musically and how it has to do with the

288
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,480
breaking of expectations so you're going

289
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,720
to be listening to a little thing this

290
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,600
is about we're going to start about 20

291
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,320
seconds before this figure so there's

292
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,600
going to be a bunch of other things and

293
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,519
maybe just look for a second yourself on

294
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,519
what expectation might be broken here

295
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:20,800
[Music]

296
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,800
you hear the accompaniment in wrong

297
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
places

298
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:56,920
[Music]

299
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,959
there's a particular expectation for how

300
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:05,639
um how things might be um might be going

301
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:08,480
and stuff and oh um and I think these

302
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,079
are our two uh guests they're um both

303
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,759
named Claire they're in alphabetical

304
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,800
order though Clare Arthur will be coming

305
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,079
first coming from Georgia Tech and

306
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,720
Claire pelofi coming from nyu's music

307
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,199
and audio research laboratory uh I'm

308
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,120
bringing in guests in part because uh

309
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,959
this is something I music cognition is

310
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,199
something I think is really really

311
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,199
important but it's probably the weakest

312
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,880
topic for me as a teacher in this field

313
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,199
so uh you should be getting this

314
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,560
information from people who uh do it

315
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,680
much better than me so that's uh great

316
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,480
who uh we have seven minutes left who

317
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,920
wants to program and unlock and who

318
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,279
wants to go um if it's early unlock go

319
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,759
okay great have a great time have a

320
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,360
great uh break and I I don't want to

321
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,959
start a new topic in seven minutes

322
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,360
either so um have a good good sorry I'll

323
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:07,959
see you after break in person but I'll

324
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,959
see you all on Friday um so thank you
