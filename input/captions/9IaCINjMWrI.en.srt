00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,640
[Music]

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,039
One of the things I'm focusing on over

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,240
these conversations is what I call

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,240
facilitative leadership. I'm talking

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,720
about facilitative leadership in the

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,200
broad sense of skills and attitudes. A

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,120
facilitative leader helps parties focus

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
on

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,680
issues, not their stand on the issues.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,440
Issues, not positions. Credibility and

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,160
authority for a facilitative leader.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,559
Credibility and authority derive from

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,800
performance, not

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,360
from entitlements bestowed by those in

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,440
top positions. Your credibility and your

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,559
authority as a facilitative leader are

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,680
not given to you. They are earned in the

18
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,840
face of the people you are working with.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,640
The goal is to look at a series of 10

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,240
micro skills that I'm going to assert

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,920
and that you will see are at the heart

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,400
of facilitative leadership in the public

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,880
sector. Micro skills like stakeholder

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,759
assessment. How do you decide who should

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,320
be involved in some effort at

26
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,320
collaborative decision making? Agenda

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,000
setting. You've got a group, you've got

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,799
a problem, but now you've got to lay out

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,200
the work for the group. Ground

30
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,759
rules. How do you help a group work when

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,960
it's not it's not a corporation? It's

32
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,119
not an organization where everyone has

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,399
internalized the same set of

34
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,720
understandings. It's an ad hoc

35
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,040
collaboration that the public sector

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,479
generates causes to have happen all the

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,360
time. And we're imagining you're either

38
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,680
the person creating that context or

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,920
you're in it and you're trying to help

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,680
manage some ad hoc assembly toward a

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,319
solution to a problem. You

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,640
need ground rules. What do you know

43
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,480
about formulating ground rules for such

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,120
a

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,720
context? Joint factf finding. How do you

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,760
get people with very different views of

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,120
things, very different levels of

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,920
capability to engage together at

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,599
analyzing, understanding before they

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,000
seek to reach agreement on something?

51
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,800
mediation. You're either being mediated

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
upon or maybe you be a mediator. Maybe

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,599
you be formally appointed the mediator.

54
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Maybe you're just the person who takes

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,120
on the mediating function within a group

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
because there isn't one and nobody else

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,480
is doing it. And somebody needs to help

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,640
the group deal with the internal

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,040
difficulties of a lot of people talking

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,000
at the same time with very different

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,840
ideas about what to do. Generating

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,760
options for mutual

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,120
gain. Anybody in a group can help a

64
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,040
group when they're trying to problem

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,319
solve generate proposals or options.

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,239
Creating value in a problem solving

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,560
context. What does that mean? How do you

68
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,440
do that? using objective

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,120
criteria. It's a very specific idea for

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
how to help people when they have a

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
bunch of options and they're trying to

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,840
choose amongst them and they all want

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,159
different things. How can you help them

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,440
argue for their view in a way that helps

75
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,879
the group toward agreement and doesn't

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,560
just make the discussion less difficult?

77
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,640
Building consensus. What does it mean to

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,959
generate consensus which is not the

79
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:01,040
least common denominator acceptable bad

80
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,720
alternative but rather an agreement on

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
the best way of dealing with the

82
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,480
differences that the group has helping a

83
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,040
group learn from its mistakes or

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,319
organizational learning. I'm going to

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,599
argue these are 10 micro skills that

86
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:20,079
somebody trying to facilitate in a

87
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:23,800
leaderly way in a public sector context

88
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,919
needs to have. So that's a set of

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:31,360
general ideas, key concepts and what I

90
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,600
wanted to move to this evening. I'm

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,240
suggesting there's a series of micro

92
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,960
skills that you can use, draw on, build.

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,639
When we think about what's taught in

94
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,320
planning schools in general and planning

95
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,080
department here in particular, um I'm

96
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,720
afraid we're not naming these as skills

97
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
that planners need. So, I'm trying to

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,840
fill a gap because I mean, you may have

99
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,639
picked these skills up in your own work,

100
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,120
in your education, because people here

101
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,680
come from many different backgrounds and

102
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,639
areas. But I want to say a word or two

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,840
about each of these. And then I want to

104
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,840
throw you into

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,800
a situation, a roleplay simulation. When

106
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,919
the negotiation starts, you will have a

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,639
role assigned to you. I'll give you some

108
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,039
general uh background about this, but

109
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,960
the material you have in front of you is

110
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
your

111
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,039
confidential instructions for the role

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,680
that you've drawn that you'll be

113
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,400
playing. Every trio will be playing

114
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
exactly the same game. And when we

115
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,000
start, I will encourage you to take your

116
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,560
chairs and find space for yourself out

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,120
of your shot of the other trios. give

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,160
you roughly half an hour to see if your

119
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,000
three people can agree on three things

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
and then we will stop. Everyone will

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,880
stop at the same time whether you have

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,639
reached the satisfactory conclusion from

123
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:10,479
your standpoint or not. You need to get

124
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:15,120
to a minimum score for there to be an

125
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,759
agreement. So the idea is you can use

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,120
these micro skills in this

127
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,039
negotiation. The goal is to get a good

128
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,440
result for yourself. There's no total

129
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,840
score for the trio. There's a score for

130
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,160
each person. We want to see what

131
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,479
strategies people used who got a good

132
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,319
outcome. I want to give credit to my

133
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,160
friend, my very dear friend John

134
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,479
Forester who invented this with Bruce

135
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,360
Stiffel. Okay. stakeholder assessment.

136
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,560
There's a technique for getting the

137
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,759
right people to the table when it is

138
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,800
your job to

139
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,360
convene stakeholders. City says, "Oh,

140
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,520
we're thinking of changing policy. We

141
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,880
want to have a public meeting. Uh we

142
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,680
want stakeholder engagement."

143
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,000
Who? How? How do you assess who the

144
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,199
relevant stakeholders are and how do you

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,479
get them to participate? Those of you

146
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,520
who are involved in the renewable energy

147
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,039
facility sighting task force know that

148
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,880
we have teams working with different

149
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,039
communities trying to bring together the

150
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
relevant stakeholders who are fighting

151
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,759
about whether a renewable energy

152
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,800
facility should or shouldn't be built.

153
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,720
There's no point convening a process to

154
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
build a consensus if you can't figure

155
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,919
out who the stakeholders are and get

156
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,880
them to be present and then figure out

157
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,360
how to engage them in ways that uh take

158
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,800
account of differences amongst them uh

159
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,840
effectively. So stakeholder assessment

160
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,560
is a process and it's a product. It

161
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,479
generates the agenda when you do it

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
right. It generates the agenda with

163
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,160
everybody's participation in setting the

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,960
agenda. It also helps to set and uh

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,199
legitimize ground rules for the group if

166
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,560
the process is run properly. But the

167
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,280
product of a stakeholder assessment is

168
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,680
uh basically a matrix of actors down the

169
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,000
side, stakeholder groups and their

170
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,840
interests across the top. And you fill

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,759
in all of those cells in that matrix.

172
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,080
And the only way to do that is to talk

173
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,400
to lots of people. I'm arguing that

174
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,840
stakeholder assessment is a skill. It

175
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,680
can be learned. I hope that hearing

176
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,959
about this this evening will encourage

177
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,039
you to at least read about it. if not

178
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,599
find a way to study it uh while you're

179
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,760
here because planners are constantly

180
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,040
asked to organize opportunities for

181
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,640
stakeholder engagement and nobody's

182
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,800
talking about how you know whether you

183
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,440
have the right people there. What's the

184
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,120
point if you can't have a way of

185
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,760
identifying the relevant stakeholder

186
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,480
groups and who can speak either like

187
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,640
them or for them? generating options for

188
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,839
mutual

189
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,399
gain. Uh you're going to be in a

190
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,360
situation there's three issues. Uh

191
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,360
there's specific options under those

192
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
three

193
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,959
issues. Those options were generated by

194
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,720
earlier conversations amongst these

195
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:29,040
parties and others in the city.

196
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:31,040
Generating options in real life is

197
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,200
getting people to have the equivalent of

198
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,760
that score sheet. You say, "Come to an

199
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,040
event or a task force." Okay,

200
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,480
participate. Okay, we're talking about

201
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,240
X. Okay, I like it or I don't like it.

202
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
But what you really want is for them to

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,080
have what you have in your scoreeet,

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,040
which is here are the issues we're going

205
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,440
to try to get agreement on. Here are the

206
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,440
options under each issue that have in a

207
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,000
sense been vetted for technical

208
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,399
feasibility or plausibility, and here's

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,680
where I stand on each option. If

210
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,600
everybody comes with that, you have a

211
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,440
chance of negotiating an agreement. It's

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
when people show up, they don't know

213
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,600
what their score sheet is. They haven't

214
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,079
talked to their people. They don't know

215
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
what the agenda sub items are. They

216
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,839
don't know the options under it. If

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,440
you're at the beginning of such a

218
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,040
process, you want to try to help

219
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,680
generate options for mutual gain.

220
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:30,480
Knowing how to do that is a skill.

221
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,240
creating value. You're going to be

222
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
talking with three people about three

223
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,040
issues for 30 minutes. There are

224
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,440
actually ways of framing

225
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,200
packages of the three issues that create

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,600
value. And either you know how to do

227
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
that or you don't. The good news is I

228
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,760
can teach you how to do that. The good

229
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,560
news is you'll probably infer it from

230
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,320
the result of this halfhour exercise.

231
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,880
But it is a skill to create value by

232
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,360
helping multiple parties

233
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,480
package multiple options under multiple

234
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,760
issues in the right way. Make the power

235
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,680
larger through value creation. Building

236
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,399
consensus comes off of that which is

237
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,320
you've got three people. They come with

238
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,480
very

239
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,839
explicit priorities and directions. You

240
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,600
start with in many cases angry parties.

241
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
You got people who are there to protect

242
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
their interests. You got people there

243
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
who are there to advance their interest.

244
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,519
You have people who are there to

245
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,079
sabotage the whole

246
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,480
effort almost always. And you're trying

247
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,720
to get

248
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,959
agreement because if you can get

249
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,600
agreement, you can guarantee everyone

250
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,560
that's what's going to happen. You were

251
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,600
empowering everyone there by saying that

252
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,800
the decision rules a consensus. In this

253
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,959
case, this is an advisory process. Well,

254
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,920
you want to have an effect as somebody

255
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,959
in an advisory process. Get unonymity

256
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,279
amongst all the adviserss and then hand

257
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,480
that to whoever the elected official was

258
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,360
who said I'm creating this advisory

259
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,040
process and say we reached unanimous

260
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,399
agreement. We hope you'll go along with

261
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,279
it. But we are your constituents, all of

262
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,160
us, and we have reached an agreement.

263
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,959
You want to empower people, help them

264
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,920
reach a consensus. When a process of

265
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,040
public engagement is organized by some

266
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,079
elected or appointed official or entity,

267
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,639
they're trying to get ideas about what

268
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,279
they can go forward with that people

269
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,680
won't vote against them, won't fight

270
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,120
them, won't bring litigation. That's a

271
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,440
way to empower people through

272
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,920
consensus using objective criteria in

273
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,240
distributive negotiation. Whatever

274
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,959
agreements you get are going to get

275
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,480
different scores for each person. You're

276
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,360
talking about an agreement that

277
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,839
distributes value across the three of

278
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,360
you. You each have some minimum you have

279
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,320
to get. You have some goal you desire

280
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,279
and you have time limits. And if you get

281
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,839
an agreement, it distributes value

282
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,480
across the three parties. How do you

283
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,480
make a case for the package that

284
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,360
distributes the most value to you that

285
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,519
you most want? You can't say, "I like

286
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,480
this one best because it's best for me."

287
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,720
And expect that to carry the

288
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,200
day. Well, what else should you say? So

289
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
and so likes

290
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,120
it. You could say that. Maybe some of

291
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,720
the people would say, "Well, then okay,

292
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,519
I'll go with what you want because so

293
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,720
and so likes it." That's a pretty weak

294
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,760
way forward. If I had an hour, I'd ask,

295
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,920
"What's your theory of practice at the

296
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,240
moment?" and ask people to tell me what

297
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,720
you would say when you present the

298
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,959
package that's best for you and you're

299
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,680
trying to get the others to agree to it.

300
00:13:52,959 --> 00:14:00,560
One of the things that you can learn how

301
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,760
to do is to argue on the merits for the

302
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,279
option that's best for

303
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:10,680
you by not making it a test of will with

304
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:15,680
the other two parties, but

305
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:18,720
rather trying to focus on what the other

306
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,199
two parties would agree. any other

307
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,440
neutral observer who knew everything

308
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,519
that was going on would agree that

309
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
that's the best option. That's an

310
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,000
objective measure. It doesn't mean

311
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,800
correct in the sense of objective. It

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,920
means what would any neutral or

313
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,199
independent party say is the best

314
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,959
outcome hearing everything. And I want

315
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:46,560
to be able to refer to the prevailing

316
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:49,199
norms or the past precedent that the

317
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,360
same communities use. Something that's

318
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,360
not about it's best for me, that's why

319
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,120
you should go along with it. Something

320
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,680
that refers to an objective standard

321
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,360
independent of your interest. Mediation

322
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,560
you're going to see practice because one

323
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,959
of you is a mediator in this exercise.

324
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,360
One of you represents the homelessness

325
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,120
task force appointed by the city.

326
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,600
There's a task force, but only the head

327
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,680
of the task force is coming. There's a

328
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,920
group of neighbors in this area who are

329
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:24,240
very, very concerned about the idea that

330
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,320
there would be a homeless shelter down

331
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,800
the street where they live. Part of the

332
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,519
concern of the neighbors is what they

333
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,079
think will happen in this shelter. Will

334
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,720
people just have a place to sleep at

335
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,639
night? Will it provide job training for

336
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,040
people so they could go from the shelter

337
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,880
if they're staying there to a job or at

338
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,519
least a job interview? How many

339
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,320
beds? What mix of

340
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,440
activities will go on in this shelter if

341
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,759
it's built? You also have to decide when

342
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,560
this shelter is going to open. It's

343
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,519
perfectly usable in its current form,

344
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,079
although a lot of people would like to

345
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,079
fix it up in a variety of ways depending

346
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,399
on their idea of what the shelter's for

347
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,800
and who it's for and how many people

348
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,519
it's going to serve. But some people are

349
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,560
really keen to get this thing to open

350
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,680
right away, and other people wouldn't

351
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,600
mind if it didn't open for a very long

352
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,920
time. You have to agree on an opening

353
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,880
date. You have to agree on how many

354
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,600
beds, what's the mix of uses, and you

355
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,959
all come with very strong views from the

356
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,680
homeless task force or from the

357
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:42,320
neighborhood about these

358
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,800
issues. The third person there works is

359
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,360
the city planning assistant director,

360
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,240
works for the mayor directly. The mayor

361
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,959
has a huge stake in this getting solved,

362
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,880
but the city council has a very

363
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,360
different idea from the mayor of what

364
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,199
this should be and who it should serve

365
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,639
and how it should be funded and all

366
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,959
kinds of stuff. The mayor would like

367
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:08,160
credit for settling this and avoiding

368
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,480
giving it to the council to decide.

369
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,640
The person there for the mayor is the

370
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,280
planning director and the mayor has

371
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,160
said, "You be a mediator and help these

372
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,240
two who initially seem to be at odds and

373
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,600
get an agreement because I want there to

374
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,360
be an agreement." So, you'll see some

375
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,919
form of mediation in action. Uh I can't

376
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,840
guarantee anything about the way the

377
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,160
mediation will play out, but we'll talk

378
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,000
about that especially afterwards. The

379
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,080
last two are not a big deal for us. this

380
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,679
evening, but I'm arguing they're really

381
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,880
important skills. If you're in a setting

382
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,280
where something goes on for a while and

383
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,640
you don't help the people that you're

384
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,440
trying to involve in this understand

385
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,480
what's happening as it's happening so

386
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,559
that they can learn from and modify

387
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,799
their way of working together, you

388
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,760
failed as a leader. Organizational

389
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,760
learning, encouraging it is a leadership

390
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,640
skill. Similarly, at the individual

391
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:15,679
level, people engaged in some practice

392
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,000
should take some time to reflect. Even

393
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,080
if they're angry at each other, even if

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
they haven't reached agreement, they

395
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,840
should try to learn something about how

396
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,480
the way they're approaching things is

397
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,360
working. People should be encouraged to

398
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,520
reflect on their engagement in processes

399
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,840
like this. and you as the leader need to

400
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,799
encourage them to reflect either

401
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,559
together or small groups or separately

402
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,360
so they get to be more effective. I

403
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,799
would argue that's a leadership skill

404
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,440
helping people improve modify their

405
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:54,320
personal theory of practice. So each

406
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,559
group has a number on your confidential

407
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,559
instructions. So all three people in the

408
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,160
group should have the same number. It

409
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,200
will work better if you're not in

410
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,880
earshot of each other doing exactly the

411
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,480
same thing in a different way next to

412
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,799
each other. So, um I want to give you

413
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,280
half an hour, 30 minutes. You are the

414
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,440
role you're assigned. Confidential means

415
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,000
confidential. You can't show your piece

416
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,600
of paper to the other person across you

417
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,840
says, "Sure, I believe it. It says it

418
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,400
right here." You you can't prove

419
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,240
something is the truth by pointing to a

420
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,840
piece of paper. You can in a game, but

421
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,880
you can't do it in real life. When

422
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,720
you're done, if you want to share your

423
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,559
confidential instructions, I'm fine with

424
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,480
that. But that's when you're really

425
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,280
done. Okay? It's in your hands. Find a

426
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,160
comfortable place for your trio to be.

427
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
We're trying to get to a position of

428
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,640
whether or not we can come to an

429
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,919
agreement on getting a shelter

430
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,919
developed. I am Mr. Goldmith, uh, the

431
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,559
planning director. I've been around

432
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,760
Westfield for 20 years. I remember the

433
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,280
old social service center that's now

434
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,320
unused. We are looking at how uh we

435
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,280
could make sure that we agree to uh

436
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:14,480
reopen this social center service to a

437
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:18,799
shelter job counseling a kitchen and

438
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,360
medical care along with housing or beds

439
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,960
for people who would otherwise be in the

440
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,960
street. Now it's uh already December. It

441
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,520
will take 6 months, we understand, to

442
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,679
rehabilitate the center to get it ready

443
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,480
to happen, but we would like this to be

444
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,840
open as soon as it is possible. I'm Jay

445
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,200
Woods. I'm part of Neighbors Together.

446
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,799
We're really glad that we were here

447
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,600
having this meeting. I've been living

448
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,679
here in the same house for 18 years and

449
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,679
so I understand the history of the

450
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,840
multi-ervice social center. Previously

451
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,159
was a daycare, before that a teen

452
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,880
counseling center. Many of those stayed

453
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,440
in the area. My concern is that

454
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,360
homelessness is just a systemic national

455
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,960
problem. It's a big problem, but it's

456
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,480
not clear that turning buildings into

457
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,480
shelters would do anything about the

458
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,960
problem itself. It's addressing a

459
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,679
symptom, not the cause. So my question

460
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,440
is, did the task force consider job

461
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,320
creation strategies that help these

462
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,559
people earn income? The homeless task

463
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,760
force claims to have reviewed all the

464
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,919
available sites in our city, but it has

465
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,280
only taken 6 months to do so. So I'm

466
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,360
just slightly confused as to how you can

467
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,280
have such a confidence in such a short

468
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,080
period of time. I think it'd be

469
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,360
fantastic to set some complete grounds

470
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,919
for the world in this discussion. Thank

471
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
you both for your introduction. I think

472
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,120
it's going to be really important for us

473
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,280
to just recognize that we are uh all

474
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,480
have

475
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,240
interest. The neighborhood association

476
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,000
does not have a problem with opening

477
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,400
beds. The problem is with the services

478
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,720
so as to make sure that people are not

479
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,200
going to stay here for a long time so we

480
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,480
address their homelessness issues right

481
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,080
now. We want a limited space but limited

482
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,480
amount before we continue maybe can

483
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,039
spend some time recapping your timeline.

484
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,679
We were told that it will take until May

485
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,960
and I think if we work together along

486
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,520
with the resident try to help them get

487
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,320
jobs. So we want to make sure that a we

488
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,799
do some work together to try and reduce

489
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,200
homelessness and that's my body control

490
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,240
but b we also have the capacity next

491
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,480
year to make sure no one has we're

492
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,240
concerned about the long-term impacts it

493
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,600
has on the people in the neighborhood um

494
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,080
property values and why can't this

495
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,159
energy be poured

496
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,640
into creating more affordable housing in

497
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,880
the city? Why are we not exploring these

498
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,320
options and have this more comprehensive

499
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,960
like official probing to what sites are

500
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,640
better as well as accompanied by

501
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,799
employment creation opportunities and uh

502
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,480
relying on already existing medical

503
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,440
facilities instead of building something

504
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,919
new wasting all of that time. It would

505
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,000
be helpful for me to do some mirroring

506
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,440
so that we are all on the same page of

507
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,360
what was stated so that we can identify

508
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,120
where there are key tension points um

509
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,280
between each other and how we can

510
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,720
address some of those tension points.

511
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
Thankfully, we're all on the same page

512
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,799
that we want to find a solution for

513
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
homelessness. A point that Miss Woods is

514
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,320
bringing up is there hasn't been enough

515
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,960
community engagement. Their request also

516
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,000
is that um can they get some more

517
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,679
statistics on what the exact need is if

518
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,240
we have a capacity of 60 an addition of

519
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,360
60 people into a neighborhood that just

520
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,080
found out about this one seems so we are

521
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,679
very concerned about what

522
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,280
this are as well agrees to conduct

523
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,360
additional engagements of the

524
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,200
communities over the next uh grace and

525
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,120
we will be providing the support

526
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,840
necessary to make sure this consultation

527
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,080
happens as soon as possible. We're just

528
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,120
concerned about what this will mean for

529
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,159
us as well. We want to support our

530
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,559
homeless

531
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:18,559
outside make sure that we're okay with

532
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:22,480
the city work to try and address the

533
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,480
issues of this

534
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,400
post. it would be worthwhile discussing

535
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,360
whether or not additional services were

536
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,840
um communities um concerned about the

537
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,480
home.

538
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,559
We agreed to an engagement process to be

539
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,880
conducted until next spring and we

540
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,000
agreed that we can start at a discussion

541
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,919
of 20 beds with additional services of

542
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,320
workforce programming um and agreed that

543
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,679
this facility can be used and should be

544
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,279
used for um services to support um

545
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:04,679
homeless. We also agreed that we would

546
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,679
engage very soon. We'll pick this up.

547
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,520
All right. Great. All right. Excellent.

548
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,600
This is a scatteragramgram of the

549
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:20,799
possible agreements when people follow

550
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,960
the rules. The numbers are just a list

551
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,799
of the possible agreements. This is

552
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,360
Hutter's score along the bottom and

553
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,960
would score this way. The mediated score

554
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:37,159
isn't plotted here. You can see that the

555
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:43,279
high score is 157 for wood. Hutter gets

556
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:46,799
105 and the high score for Hutter 165

557
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:50,000
when Wood gets 120. And then there's a

558
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,720
bunch of other possible agreements. So

559
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,080
all all eight groups got agreement in

560
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,559
the limited time available but the

561
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,559
agreements were different. This

562
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:07,360
scatagram is designed to show that it's

563
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:10,960
possible to create different amounts of

564
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,240
value and distribute them differently

565
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,880
all within the same frame of allowable

566
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,520
agreements. All of these are legitimate

567
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,000
given the minimum that each party had to

568
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,279
have. And

569
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,960
yet some pairs were

570
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:31,840
able to generate a high score and some

571
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,240
only were able to get a low score or all

572
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,559
legitimate agreements following the

573
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,400
rules. I'm showing you what the maximum

574
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,600
is in your role that you could have

575
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,120
gotten while your counterpart got an

576
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,120
acceptable amount for them. And so the

577
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,480
question is, were you just satisfied

578
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,919
with less or was the way you approached

579
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,080
it destined to get you less than what

580
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,600
the maximum is you could have gotten?

581
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,720
There's no way to really compare it to

582
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,240
anybody else unless you have all the

583
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,440
score sheets and all of the confidential

584
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:10,080
instructions. There are um a lot of

585
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,679
possible agreements in this same

586
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,360
context. Almost all of the Goldsmith

587
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,080
roles got over a 100 points. I overheard

588
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,919
one group where both the parties said,

589
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,640
"Yeah, sure. We'll give you 20 points

590
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,799
each." And

591
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,559
then the person in the Goldsmith role

592
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,120
said, "Well, I do have to tell you I had

593
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,400
a hidden agenda." I was working for the

594
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,760
mayor. The mayor insists that this not

595
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,120
open until next winter. Now, this person

596
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,279
is passing themselves off as a neutral

597
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,840
mediator, but the fact of the matter is

598
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:51,679
they have an agenda. They also have a

599
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:55,200
personal agenda of wanting one group to

600
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,760
to do better, do as best as possible

601
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,559
even at the expense of the other group.

602
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,120
That's not neutrality. We typically

603
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,679
define mediation as neutral or

604
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:11,039
nonpartisan assistance to parties in a

605
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,600
conflict. Mediation is a and

606
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,480
facilitation are functions. They're

607
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,600
tasks. They're services that can be

608
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,760
provided. We happen to have this sort of

609
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,840
analytic backdrop where we can see, oh,

610
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,840
the

611
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,600
mediator had a

612
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,279
bias. The source of the bias in this

613
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,520
case was they worked for the mayor and

614
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,720
the mayor said, "You're my person at

615
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,840
this thing. I don't want this to fail

616
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,760
because I don't want to give my city

617
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,880
council counterpart the opportunity to

618
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,840
take over this issue and run it the way

619
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,000
he wants to run it. On the other hand,

620
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,600
uh you should help the parties reach

621
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,279
agreement."

622
00:28:51,600 --> 00:29:00,039
So the mediator had to struggle with

623
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:03,760
their mandate and their personal beliefs

624
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:08,240
and the perceptions of the parties. So

625
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:12,480
Claudia, um you you got the the high

626
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:17,440
score. Um, I'm curious what your

627
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:20,960
counterparts have to say about uh your

628
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,480
way of working with them since uh you've

629
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,240
got the the highest score substantially

630
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,760
higher 157. Did she seem to be pushing

631
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,559
you around? She she did something to end

632
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,320
up with the highest possible score in

633
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,039
that role.

634
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Same information, same cards dealt,

635
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,520
different result as a mediator also just

636
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,960
yeah need to adjust those numbers on

637
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,240
mine. Just what should it be? 68. Ah,

638
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,000
okay. Now I understand.

639
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
Jennifer was was great to speak with. I

640
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,559
think she had really clear goals and was

641
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,440
also really amendable to to working with

642
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,039
the housing task force. Yeah, she's very

643
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:07,039
firm advocating for the residents and

644
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:11,120
she also is very clear about coming to

645
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,320
an agreement like I kind of feel I need

646
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,880
to giving some like the things I want in

647
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,799
order to reach. Yeah. I mean your score

648
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,840
is perfectly fine. It just happens to be

649
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,919
less than it could have been. Yeah.

650
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,480
because your counterpart uh got the most

651
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:34,279
possible. Yeah. And I'm trying to see

652
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,919
whether there was anything that she said

653
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:41,279
did that made you feel like you should

654
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,760
lower your expectations or do you feel

655
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,159
like your expectations were met? So

656
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,080
fine. So she got a high score. So what?

657
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,960
I feel like the way she said is helps us

658
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,600
to like empathize a lot with the

659
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,760
residents. I think that's why Yeah, I

660
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,880
think Jennifer was really clear on the

661
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,480
fact that it sounded like the

662
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,320
neighborhood that you were part of had

663
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,440
had frustrations in the past and that

664
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,600
like you didn't want this this to recur

665
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,600
and you were I think really clear about

666
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,200
the impact that that had on you and and

667
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
your constituents.

668
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,159
So, you've got the high score at the

669
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,559
other end of the 150. What's the

670
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:23,440
reaction of your partners to hearing

671
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,600
that whatever it was you said or did got

672
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,600
you the highest possible score? You

673
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,200
didn't get a bad score. It's just a low

674
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,919
score. I think we maximized the winning

675
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,399
of the both parties or the three parties

676
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,039
even. I appreciate the point. I mean it

677
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,000
you in this context people have a

678
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,080
minimum score. If they get the minimum

679
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,279
score they can go back to their group

680
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,159
and say we got a we got what we wanted.

681
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,919
But you can create more value than just

682
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:57,120
the minimum for each side depending on

683
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,679
how you proceed. If you presume that

684
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,840
your goal is your minimum, then you're

685
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,480
not going to look for possible trades

686
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,559
that will create more value for both

687
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,200
sides and the other person isn't going

688
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,960
to say no because you're offering

689
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,440
something better than what they would

690
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,559
otherwise get and you're getting more

691
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,840
for yourself. This is about creating

692
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,399
trades for mutual gain.

693
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,919
And the only way to do that is to play

694
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:33,360
the game of what if. And I didn't listen

695
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:36,240
in uh to your tables, but usually the

696
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,360
way you find your way, if you imagine

697
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,000
that everybody's starting down here at a

698
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,960
bare minimum and you want to go as far

699
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
to the northeast, you can presume

700
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,559
there's a paro curve, which is the list

701
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,320
of options that go across the top. So,

702
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,120
you're starting down here and you want

703
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,960
to move as far as you possibly can to

704
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,279
the northeast. You don't know how far

705
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,200
you can get because you don't have all

706
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,159
the scores ahead of time, but you know

707
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,760
you want to move that way. So, if I say,

708
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,279
"Well, if you offer me seven, agreement,

709
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:15,039
seven down at the bottom, it's barely

710
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:18,799
acceptable. 100 107 for wood, 105

711
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,480
uh for for Hutter." And then I say back

712
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:27,159
to you, if I'm would, how

713
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:30,480
about if we go to 13, you get

714
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:34,000
more. I do too, but you get more. I'm

715
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,159
moving from seven to 13. And I'm looking

716
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,559
for a package where

717
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:43,679
I offer you more by making a change on

718
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,440
the list of which option I'm agreeing to

719
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,360
under one of the issues that seemed

720
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,200
important to you. if you will move to a

721
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,480
different option on another issue that's

722
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,600
most important to me. The two parties do

723
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,919
not value the three issues the same.

724
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,240
They have different

725
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,840
priorities. If you can't discover that,

726
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,840
then you can't offer a

727
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,240
whatif. So, understanding the other

728
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,639
side's interest is the first step in

729
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:18,320
creating value for mutual gain. That's a

730
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,800
what if. It's a trade. It's a package.

731
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,879
And I don't know what to offer until I

732
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,399
know what's important to the other side.

733
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,839
I won't know that if I don't ask. And

734
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:33,119
I'm exploring all the possible whatifs

735
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:36,879
until I get to the puditive, but I don't

736
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,560
know where it is exactly paro frontier,

737
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,760
which is this outer edge from top to

738
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,839
bottom of scores. Now you can be in

739
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,040
economic terms at the outer edge. You're

740
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,599
superefficient. You've used up all the

741
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,720
value because that you've moved out to

742
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,560
this frontier, this surface across the

743
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,560
top. But there's a lot of places that

744
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,200
you could be that that curve goes all

745
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,640
across the whole spectrum. It's no more

746
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,920
about efficiency. It's

747
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:11,760
about equity. Anything on that curve,

748
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,880
it's no more value left to split.

749
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,200
But I can move along the curve where I

750
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,240
do better, you will do worse. When

751
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,320
you're talking about a a paro efficient

752
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,400
curve, you are talking about a zero- sum

753
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,880
situation. There's a maximum amount of

754
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,079
value. And as long as I go to the

755
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,359
northeast and hit that curve, I haven't

756
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,160
wasted any possible value. I've explored

757
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,920
enough whatifs, understood enough about

758
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,119
our differing interest that I can move.

759
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,240
But where on that curve I end up, that's

760
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,320
not about using all the value. That's

761
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,760
about who gets what. In the process of

762
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:57,440
building consensus, in any effort to

763
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,880
create value, in any effort to generate

764
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,440
new options, packages for mutual gain,

765
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,320
but we're both advantaged by the more we

766
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,200
move out to that surface. So for people

767
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,880
who read books about win-win, it's an

768
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,359
illusion because there are constraints

769
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,599
on both sides relative to what issues

770
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,000
they can agree to or can't or there are

771
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,680
legal limits or there are time limits.

772
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,560
You can see how you did relative to the

773
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,560
extremes. First of all, you got an

774
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,520
agreement though that was good. Now,

775
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:34,400
within the frame of agreement, did you

776
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:37,920
set your goals too low and thus accept a

777
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,160
deal that was fine but not the maximum

778
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,359
you could have gotten if you had been

779
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,800
more aggressive? Did you set your goals

780
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,200
too high, hit a wall with the other

781
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,400
side, and collapse down to a barely

782
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,240
acceptable agreement from both of you

783
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,640
because there was no more time to create

784
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,280
value? I'm talking about the context in

785
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,920
which these kinds of micro skills come

786
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,880
into play. The more confident you are in

787
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,440
what you're doing when you're doing

788
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,520
these, the more you will feel yes, I

789
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,520
should keep posing more questions to

790
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,119
understand their interests better

791
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,640
because if I don't understand their

792
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,960
interests, I'm never going to propose

793
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,560
something good for them and great for me

794
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,079
because I don't I can't do the first

795
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,440
part because I haven't asked enough

796
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,640
questions. So the more confident you are

797
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,520
about the search for value creation, the

798
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,200
more you're going to ask questions. Not

799
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,000
just for the sake of counting how many

800
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,960
questions, but for the sake of

801
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,839
understanding the other side's

802
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,320
interests. And the more confident you

803
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,440
are, the more you'll search for

804
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,760
unexpected trades, unexpected whatifs.

805
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,359
The more confident you are about this

806
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,800
underlying structure, the more assertive

807
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,040
you will be about your interests, the

808
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,280
more focused you will be on the other

809
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,079
side's interests, the more confident you

810
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,640
will be about suggesting packages and

811
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,880
options for mutual gain. So, it's not

812
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,880
just about learning what these micro

813
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,560
skills are. It's also about being able

814
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,320
to use them with confidence. I want you

815
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,200
to take away the sense that there's

816
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,960
micro skills you can work on to advance

817
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,760
your leadership

818
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:30,240
capacities. Next time we meet, I want to

819
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:35,599
be able to talk with you and get as many

820
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:38,000
individuals as I can uh to say, "Oh,

821
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,960
what do you see as your own strengths

822
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,800
and weaknesses relative to facilitative

823
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,599
leadership?" Because what I want to

824
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,520
provoke is your plan for what you're

825
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,160
going to do and I want to put that in

826
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,480
the context of being here in the

827
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,240
department and in the degree program

828
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,599
you're in. How you going to enhance your

829
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,839
capabilities? The answer is going to be

830
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,599
personal and different. I'm also

831
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,280
expecting some people to say, you know,

832
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,280
I'm not so worried about being in a

833
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,440
leadership role. I'm content to be part

834
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,079
of a team and be working on something I

835
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,480
believe in and the leadership doesn't

836
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,240
appeal to me or I don't see myself that

837
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,920
way. If that's how you think, I hope

838
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,000
you'll say that. I want to be sure

839
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,200
you've asked and answered it in a

840
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,400
thoughtful way so that you can use the

841
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,119
time you have here appropriately to the

842
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,400
extent you want to take facilitative

843
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:35,119
leadership roles. So, I'll see everybody

844
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,119
next Thursday and dinner once again.
