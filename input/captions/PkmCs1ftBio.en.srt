1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:01,501
My name is Sofia.

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,794
And, I am a lawyer in background

3
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,004
and training, which kind of

4
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,672
 means that MIT

5
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,173
is not exactly the place where

6
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,425
you would expect

7
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,968
a lawyer to find herself.

8
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,179
I got the opportunity to join Cleantech for Europe,

9
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,973
a policy coalition

10
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,642
representing Europe's foremost climate tech

11
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,769
innovators and climate tech investors

12
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,730
towards European policymakers.

13
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,647
I had the opportunity

14
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,859
to co-draft a report on how Europe

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,944
can win the climate tech race

16
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,320
without subsidies

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,655
and called for a European

18
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,823
cleantech investment plan,

19
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,992
which was one of the main reasons

20
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,618
that I kind of understood

21
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,453
I needed to complement

22
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,247
my policy skills with business skills.

23
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,333
It was important that not only I do this MBA,

24
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,835
but the MBA has a very

25
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,128
strong focus on climate,

26
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,089
but also the university is very

27
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,758
committed to the fight

28
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,884
against climate change.

29
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,761
I really feel deeply connected

30
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,637
to the wider MIT community.

31
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:59,684
This is exactly why I was able to be a part

32
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,436
of the organizing committee of the

33
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,064
MIT Energy Conference for 2025.

34
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,482
This year, we're focusing

35
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,818
on scaling climate tech innovation.

36
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,863
For the world to reach net-zero emissions,

37
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,656
we really need a lot of technologies

38
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,282
to work

39
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:14,824
together.

40
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,159
We don't

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,036
necessarily need only one technology.

42
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,455
We need all these technologies to work.

43
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,998
This year’s topic

44
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,960
exactly represents what MIT is good at and

45
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,254
what MIT is

46
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,380
giving out to the world.

47
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,882
Which is this innovation

48
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,301
that we need to reach our climate goals.

49
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,761
Many of my role models

50
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,805
had run the conference before, particularly

51
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,973
the person who founded the project,

52
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,725
the MIT Energy Conference,

53
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,810
David Danielson.

54
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,103
As part of the conference,

55
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,979
we are continuing this legacy,

56
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,231
created by people who

57
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,690
are leading the climate charge.
