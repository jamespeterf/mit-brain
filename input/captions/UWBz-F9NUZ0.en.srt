1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,160
so at vivc what we do is we take drugs

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,679
that normally cannot be absorbed by the

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,599
GI tract and get into the systemic

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,000
circulation and we take these drugs they

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,800
normally have to be given by IV and we

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,960
transform them into a tablet into a

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,480
simple pill and when the slides are up I

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,240
can jump to um the main part and show

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,400
you that how can we do this um well

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,320
first of all the reason why we do it is

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,879
that currently over 40% of the drugs on

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,840
the market um are large molecules and

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,079
Maria's presentation touched on this

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,000
earlier and so basically the size limits

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,960
them getting across the GI tract so with

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,440
the market um expanding in these areas

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
it's very very important to give

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,000
patients the choice to be able to take

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,199
the medicine orally and that's our

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
vision at vivc so we work with different

21
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:04,039
biotech and Pharma companies who have

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,039
new drugs that cannot get across the GI

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,680
tract okay so we work with biotech and

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,479
Pharma companies who have and drugs that

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,560
cannot get across the GI tract to make

26
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,560
them into oral pills so the challenge as

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,400
I said is that it's a large number of

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
drugs and our vision is to H give

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,079
patients the choice and the benefit for

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,240
the patients also touched by media

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,560
earlier is that you avoid needle pain

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,079
safety issu issues there is a higher

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,280
patient adherence but also the ability

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,720
to take a tablet at home really has a

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,040
positive impact on the Health Care

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,360
system and also there are advantages for

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,320
Pharma there's a larger patient

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,799
population a market that they can tap

39
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,880
into it also expands the IP uh

40
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,159
protection for that molecule and often

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,159
it gives competitive Advantage for a

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,079
particular Pharma company in a

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,240
particular therapeutic area

44
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,920
so the vivx engine is depicted in this

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,560
slide and it's there are three main

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,840
components so if you focus on the top

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,879
left hand corner we have a high

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,000
throughput GI ass system physiologically

49
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,680
relevant called the GI orus and we have

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
multiple nature Publications that show

51
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,480
validation and what we essentially do is

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,080
we can test the ability of thousands of

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,760
compounds per day their ability to get

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,000
across the GI tract so we use Pig GI

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,280
tract and we also have access to human

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
GI tract

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,400
tissue moving to the right hand side

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,840
we've now got over 130,000 data points

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,680
and so what we can do then is

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,440
interrogate the data use AI models and

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,159
in-house expertise to look at a

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,000
particular compound and predict what

63
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,680
type of chemicals that we can add as a

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,879
combination and a formulation to help

65
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,560
that compound get across the GI track

66
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,120
tract and then H down at the bottom what

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,280
we also have is we have our own IP on a

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,879
range of different formulations that

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,360
we've identified and it's the

70
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,280
combination of all three that enable us

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,560
if you look at the Orange Box we're

72
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,760
primarily working on peptides we can

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,319
also work on algon nucleotides and

74
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,159
smaller proteins but this system enables

75
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,799
us to take something that has to be

76
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,959
given to a patient needle to make it

77
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,200
orally bioavailable so why can we do

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,560
this and other people can't because we

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,000
have the GI Odis platform the high

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,080
throughput system we can test thousands

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,959
of compounds a day normally other

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,840
companies have to do that in Vivo

83
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,480
studies and that can take years to to

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,239
test this number of compounds again we

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,159
I've said we've got the rapidly growing

86
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,680
database which is an advantage other

87
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,840
companies don't have that or

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,439
organizations and also we've got our own

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,480
drug delivery IP that we can use and

90
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,400
other people are limited to what's out

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,720
there in the public domain

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,560
so now I wanted to share H quickly a

93
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,480
couple of case studies of data that

94
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,000
we've um produced using our platform so

95
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,640
here I've got four different molecules

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,280
and that we're looking at the aoi

97
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,519
availability of liquid H formulations in

98
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,799
a rat PK model the Y AIS is the oral

99
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
bioavailability and the x is the

100
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,320
different compounds with different

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,759
formulations so on the left hand side if

102
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,320
we look at the vancom an antibiotic and

103
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,520
normally it has got a really low oral

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,800
bioavailability we use a benchmark

105
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,160
formulation that everyone can use out

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
there and it's called sodium caprate and

107
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,840
what you can see here is that with that

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,919
Benchmark formulation you get very low

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,320
Auto bioavailability of vancom is with

110
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,120
our formulation identified we can

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,320
produce a 15-fold increase one of our

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,199
partner compounds for recycl peptide

113
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,280
looking at the second graph you can see

114
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,520
that we actually increased from

115
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,000
Benchmark and with our formulation we've

116
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,960
got a fourfold increase for the second

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,680
partner compound we've actually had a

118
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,039
40-fold increase and then I included the

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,360
semaglutide data here because I'm sure

120
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,880
everyone in the room knows about glp1

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,720
Agonist is reading all the information

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,280
out there at the moment and what we

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,520
managed to do is taking novan nordis

124
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,000
semaglutide if we add a benchmark

125
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,880
formulation the C10 versus what we have

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,120
in house with um our vivx formulation

127
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,759
we've got a 10-fold increase in oral

128
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,479
bioavailability so I'm sure that the

129
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,479
data that I'm showing to you just now

130
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,960
has convinced you that our vivx engine

131
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,560
does work and so the ask today is we

132
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,639
have some Partnerships already

133
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,080
established we've already got seven

134
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,440
Partnerships and the Partnerships can be

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,160
either a formulation partnership whereby

136
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,160
a partner comes to us and says I've got

137
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,319
this really interesting compound it

138
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,680
shows efficacy but it has to be given as

139
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
IV at the moment can you work with us to

140
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,199
give us an oral

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,560
and um today this year in 2024 we've got

142
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,479
multiple um Partnerships only some of

143
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,080
them are in the public domain we

144
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,800
announced earlier this year that we had

145
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,160
a partnership with est stellis for such

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,240
a program and last week a press release

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
out that we're working with ailum a

148
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,240
company on the west coast developing um

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,639
immune related disease molecules and

150
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,440
then the second type of Technology uh

151
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,720
sorry partnership we look for is a

152
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,720
strategic technology partnership so what

153
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,440
we can do is if a comp has a particular

154
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,120
type of molecule so for example last

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,919
week again a press release out about

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,599
orbis medicines who are funded by Novo

157
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,639
seeds they have um cyclic peptides and

158
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,560
they want to work with us so that we can

159
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,120
help them develop or bioavailable and AI

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,080
proteins is an another company in this

161
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,639
area a a Boston based company who have

162
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,639
many proteins which are Sur antibodies

163
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,840
so we're also working with them so I'm

164
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,039
interested if anyone in the rooms got

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,800
any H potential projects whether it's

166
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:07,000
formulation or strategic technology I'd

167
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
be happy to speak to you and why should

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,479
you partner with us because we have a

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,120
very experienced team spearheaded by

170
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:18,919
myself uh a solid board of directors and

171
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,160
Global experts as scientific advisors so

172
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:24,400
again apologies for the technical

173
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,680
difficulty um hopefully um you

174
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
understand what we're doing and if

175
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,879
anyone wants to speak to me at lunch

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,400
break or reach out to me after after I'd

177
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:36,500
be happy to discuss with you

178
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,500
[Applause]
