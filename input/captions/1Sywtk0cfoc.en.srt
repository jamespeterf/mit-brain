1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,719
Okay, good afternoon everyone. Uh this

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,120
is the final stretch. Uh thank you all

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,639
for uh staying with us. I think it's

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,680
been a lot of um interesting and

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,760
exciting conversations. Um as you have

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,000
probably noticed uh throughout the day,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,359
we have actually uh brought the voices

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,640
of all relevant stakeholders um in our

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,079
latter secures uh accelerator ecosystem.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,760
uh we've had um of course um academic uh

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,760
you know leaders uh like Jonathan

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,559
Weisson for example who gave an amazing

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,520
lecture this morning uh and then um you

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,960
know we had uh Jimmy Oligary who gave a

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
fantastic talk from the patient

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,000
perspective uh a cickle cell disease

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,160
patient who uh scaled Kilimanjaro so you

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,960
know remarkable story and so now we're

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280
hearing from um uh Fiona Marshall uh who

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
actually represents for us another very

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
important stakeholder in in this

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,800
ecosystem that we're all a part of and

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,039
that's of course uh the biioarma uh

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,799
component and that will be a theme for

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,880
uh our conversation during the panel

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
discussion that David Miker will lead um

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,560
a little later this afternoon. So I

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,920
think uh Fiona Marshall needs no

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,600
introduction but I will go ahead and

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,400
introduce her. She is the president of

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
the uh biomedical research at Novartis

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
um the job that's a senior faculty

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,880
member once told me is the most coveted

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,280
job in Kendall Square. So um uh she

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,159
actually there leads uh uh more than

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
5,000 scientists uh in six research

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,079
sites uh dedicated to the discovery of

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
uh biio medicine across the Novartis

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,560
ecosystem and across the entire pipeline

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,799
leading uh basically R&D development uh

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,720
for Novartis. Uh prior to this uh

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
position uh Fiona served as senior vice

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
president and global head of discovery

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,960
and early development at Merc and prior

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
to that she was the founder and uh CSO

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,560
of Heptarkus Therapeutics a UK based uh

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,119
company that was focused on

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,280
structure-based uh drug design. So she

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,880
has a rich uh background from which to

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
draw for all the discussions that we've

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,240
been having today. It's really a great

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,960
honor to have you here today Fiona. So

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,960
thank you very much for coming.

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,319
Thanks so much for inviting me Anna and

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
thanks for everybody being here on a

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,800
Friday afternoon. So it's a privilege to

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,200
come to the broad and just such such a

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
wonderful uh uh institute that I've

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,280
obviously followed for for many many

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,879
years actually since its inception. So

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
um I'm going to talk to you about some

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,720
of the work we've been doing at at

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,120
Novartis but particularly tapping into

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,200
some of the themes of this meeting uh in

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,400
rare disease. Obviously as a company we

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,400
work very broadly across uh uh many many

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,879
different diseases ranging from some of

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,760
the very most common through to uh very

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,400
rare diseases. Uh this is really just a

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,360
sort of overview of the company. Um so

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,319
we have focus in four main therapeutic

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,239
areas. Uh cardiovascular renal and

73
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,920
metabolic fall under one therapeutic uh

74
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,680
construct oncology immunology and

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,160
neuroscience. Now we don't have a

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
separate rare diseases unit which some

77
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,159
companies have uh although that changes

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
in the industry quite a bit but what we

79
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,280
do certainly work in rare diseases but

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,360
within these core disease areas uh and

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
then we do certainly try and combine

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,040
expertise uh on our platform

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
technologies and and share that

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,560
expertise and knowledge across the

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
different disease areas. One of the

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
fortunate things of working for Novatist

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,239
is we do do a lot of different

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,800
modalities probably more than any of the

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,200
other farmer companies. Uh so as well as

90
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,720
the small molecules and and biologics uh

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,239
we do have gene therapy uh XRNA as we

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,040
call it which can be many different

93
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,440
types of olgonucleotide therapy uh as

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,599
well as gene and and cell therapy and we

95
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,080
are a global company one of the largest

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,760
biioarma companies and uh you know

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
really for us we are trying to deliver

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,280
high value medicines uh also to as many

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
people as possible. So as well as and

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,599
and thinking really about uh the the

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,640
highest unmet need, we also do a lot of

102
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,959
work in the global health area and I I

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,239
was really pleased that we uh won the

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,439
award for the the highest access uh to

105
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,920
patients last year. Uh so uh Novatist

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
medicine's reached 300 million people

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,080
around the world and that included over

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,479
30 million who were in low to middle

109
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,079
inome countries. So we do try and uh

110
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,519
enable access uh whenever we can.

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
uh one of the things I'm sure we'll get

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,120
to talk about on the panel is sort of

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
alluded to on the on the final column. I

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
mean there are a lot of headwinds in

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
terms of execution uh of uh delivering

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,440
new medicines. I would say it is getting

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,680
harder. I've worked in the industry a

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
long time. uh and we are continually

119
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
trying to challenge ourselves to improve

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,160
R&D productivity and from a research

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,840
point of view uh choosing the right

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,759
targets and making sure those are the

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,919
right targets for the diseases that we

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,360
want to treat uh is really the the way

125
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,520
that I think about how to improve

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
productivity. It's really removing all

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,160
those or certainly reducing the numbers

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,440
of failures that we have. So this really

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
summarizes what we're doing in

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,840
biomedical research. So uh yes I I am

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,560
very lucky to have this job. I I would

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,680
agree with that part of it. Um we do

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,919
work across these incredibly important

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
uh and and interesting and challenging

135
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,360
disease areas. Uh so these I have the

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
disease area heads. Uh we also have a

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,919
group called DAX which is supposed to be

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,600
sort of any disease area that we think

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,280
there could be a breakthrough. And in

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,560
fact interestingly that's where we have

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,000
our our renal uh portfolio now a growing

142
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
one which I am going to tell you a bit

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,240
more about. Uh and then a new group

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
which I've set up uh since joining

145
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,280
Nevada is called DARE which is diseases

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
of aging and and regenerative medicine

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,919
and uh that's thinking still about these

148
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,800
same diseases but in an orthogonal way.

149
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,639
Why is it that aging contributes uh to

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,880
so many different diseases and what are

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,199
those pathways and we'll probably talk

152
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,080
about nodal biology later but I do think

153
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,360
that aging and certain parts of the

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,919
aging process really are key nodes in

155
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,520
diseases of aging that we can target. So

156
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,600
again we work across many different

157
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
therap technology platforms and I'm

158
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,319
going to describe some of these in a bit

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,919
more detail and particularly the ones

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,319
that I think are most relevant to the

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,319
rare diseases

162
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,880
space. Hence this slide. Okay. So let's

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,240
start with gene therapy. Uh AAV gene

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,240
therapy. So uh we were fortunate enough

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,039
to be able to bring Zolenma uh AAV9 gene

166
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,960
therapy uh to market. Uh when we

167
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,880
acquired AEXUS and we first started

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
working on AAV9 of course we did think

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,960
it was going to have a lot of

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,560
opportunity in many different diseases

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
and as we already heard from our

172
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
previous speaker um you know that hasn't

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,199
been as easy as we first hoped. uh one

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,520
of it is the of course the im immunity

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,919
that some people have to AAV but also

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,160
the tropism of those capsids especially

177
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,319
to CNS neurons was actually much poorer

178
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,479
than we first expected so we've put a

179
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,720
lot of effort also into engineering new

180
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,560
capsids both internally but through

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
additional business development we work

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,880
with Voyager who many of you may know uh

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,120
and we recently acquired a company Kate

184
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,000
Therapeutics and they very much focused

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,680
on uh the

186
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,240
musculardrophies um so really evolving

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,280
myotropic hit capsids that can deliver

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,280
uh genes to both muscle sceal muscle as

189
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
well as cardiac muscle. I'm not going to

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,400
say too much more about that but happy

191
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,080
to talk about that in the questions. Uh

192
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,360
one of the modalities I'm going to focus

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,240
on today uh is sir. I think this for me

194
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,360
is one of the most uh exciting

195
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,840
modalities uh for the treatment of a

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
wide range of diseases. I think the next

197
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,560
generation now is not just about

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,960
delivering sirna to the liver, but it is

199
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
about more targeted delivery to specific

200
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,520
cell types. And we've been doing a lot

201
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,160
of work in that area uh to really try

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,319
and uh tie down um different

203
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,280
opportunities across again both rare as

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,520
well as common diseases. Now, uh coming

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,520
from a structural biology background, um

206
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,080
I still really like small molecules.

207
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,319
Oral small molecules are a drug that you

208
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,560
really can easily deliver to to patients

209
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
around the world. But what's fun now is

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,400
all of the incredible extra knowledge

211
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,160
that we have from structural biology

212
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,160
through techniques like cryeleron

213
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,919
microscopy, but also now predictions

214
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,360
like alphafold really really allow us to

215
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,280
design chemical compounds that can

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
change protein function either to

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,000
increase or decrease or alter expression

218
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,240
levels or alter protein protein

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,639
interactions in very unique and novel

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,479
ways that are really allowing us to

221
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,639
target pathways that were not before

222
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,560
possible. And a sort of an extension of

223
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,719
that is also the targeted protein

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,640
degradation uh where you can really

225
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,800
essentially knock out a protein by

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,120
causing its degradation. And again a pro

227
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,039
a project that I w didn't have time to

228
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,959
talk about today but I'd like to is on

229
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,120
our cickle cell disease where we are

230
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,399
using a degrader of a transcription

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,640
factor um that actually converts adult

232
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,399
and fetal hemoglobin and that's now in

233
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
clinical trials for cle cell disease.

234
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,000
But again we focused on that as a

235
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,080
modality by thinking about who are the

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
patients that need this drug. So one of

237
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
the considerations on choosing a

238
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,080
modality one is what problem are you

239
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,399
trying to solve but also who needs that

240
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,240
drug and of course all of the patients

241
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,560
we we actually have stickle cell disease

242
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
is a part of our global health portfolio

243
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,560
and we think that uh you know treating

244
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,080
those patients with an an oral small

245
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,399
molecule is is the one that will give

246
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,519
the most

247
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,959
access. So going to say a little bit

248
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,240
about what we're doing in the genetics

249
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,399
field because this is another area that

250
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
I've grown significantly since joining

251
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,040
um Novatist being a real believer in the

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,440
power of human genetics to inform on

253
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,839
target selection not just again for rare

254
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,600
monogenic diseases but also you know

255
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
much broader diseases. I mean there

256
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,800
there really I don't think is a disease

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,800
that doesn't have a genetic component

258
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,760
and we're still really learning that uh

259
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,600
the more we look and dive into the data.

260
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,080
Uh but one of the areas that we're doing

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,760
is really to set set up a new group. Um

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
some of you may know Jeremy Jenkins.

263
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,399
He's the head of our target ID group.

264
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,480
Within target ID, uh we have a genetics

265
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,560
group. And really the objective here is

266
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,200
to try and find new targets, test out

267
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,200
new hypothesis and interrogate those in

268
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,480
different ways to try and prioritize our

269
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,560
selection uh for drug discovery. We work

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
very much matrix now across the

271
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,640
organization. So very close interactions

272
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,720
between the research and the development

273
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,800
and our commercial colleagues. We do we

274
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,399
do have to take them uh their view into

275
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,040
account. Unfortunately there are some

276
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,680
rare diseases which uh are too small for

277
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,079
for us to work on. Um but we do work uh

278
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,920
really as as a as a group together

279
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,160
thinking about what is the high patient

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,720
unmet need. What what are areas where we

281
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,959
can really add value uh and work on

282
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
together. A lot of this comes down to

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
data. One of the things which is very

284
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,279
exciting now is the quantity of data

285
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,200
that's available in genetics and you

286
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,360
know I I I'm old enough to have been

287
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
there around the sequencing of the human

288
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
genome all the expectations that we had

289
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,640
in 10 years time everybody was going to

290
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,399
be treated uh with and have all the you

291
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,920
know DNA sequenced well that didn't

292
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,600
happen in 2010 we're now 25 years later

293
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,240
but I do feel that we are really getting

294
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,800
there terms of the amount of data that

295
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,800
allows us to get these incredible uh uh

296
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,399
you associations and genetic

297
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,640
information, but the data is still not

298
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,320
in all the right format and we're still

299
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,920
not very good at asking the right

300
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,920
questions. So, where do we use genetics

301
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,640
now? Actually, it's across many of the

302
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,399
things that we do. And it's not so much

303
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
about those monogenic disorders,

304
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,079
although we are working on those, but

305
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,560
it's really about those genes that alter

306
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,360
your risk, either increase or decrease

307
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,440
your risk of uh uh broader diseases that

308
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,560
we're working on. So we're trying to

309
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,839
identify targets uh target validation

310
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,680
from databases and and genetic cohorts.

311
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,600
We're also using it for biomarker

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,600
discovery because again I think terms of

313
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,680
clinical trials ideally we want to

314
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
really accelerate clinical trials by

315
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,120
having much better biomarker readouts.

316
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,480
Another thing we could pick up on the

317
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,519
panel also use genetics to enrich trial

318
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839
design. Uh and also use genetics to

319
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,040
really understand about target safety.

320
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,160
uh and there's a number of different

321
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,600
ways in which we're doing that but

322
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
overall what I really want to do is try

323
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
and shrink that timeline I mean a

324
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
timeline that you showed of how long it

325
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,079
takes to get those and those should have

326
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,720
been fast timelines in a in a disease uh

327
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,639
you know like uh musculardrophe our

328
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,480
timelines really need to be short much

329
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,240
shorter half the time I mean not 10

330
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,120
years five years and we need to do

331
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,560
everything we can to make that

332
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,240
happen so again one of the big things

333
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,040
for me is getting all of the data that

334
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,360
we can uh and human genetics data is one

335
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,440
of Of course, single cell data, single

336
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,000
cell profiling data is another getting

337
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,600
all these multimodal data that can come

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
together is what gives you that

339
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,440
confidence uh to move forward in a

340
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,200
target. I'm not going to go through all

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
of these different data sources that

342
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,440
we've invested in. They all have

343
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,760
different benefits uh in terms of the

344
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,880
types of patient populations, the sizes

345
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,360
of the data uh sizes of the population

346
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,200
but also uh whether we have access to

347
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,040
health records to exom sequencing data

348
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
uh to samples also whether there's an

349
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,360
opportunity to recall the patients when

350
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,040
we make interesting observations and

351
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
also whether you can also then trace

352
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,680
back uh the family history is also

353
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,880
incredibly useful. uh and I'm glad to

354
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,200
say that you know there's a lot of

355
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,600
public data and public initiatives and

356
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,959
public private partnerships uh where we

357
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,720
work together particularly with other

358
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,160
farmer companies um on these types of

359
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,680
programs. So again I've got a few slides

360
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,680
keep going back to the same problem. It

361
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,560
is the data is the data in the right

362
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,360
place is it in the right architecture uh

363
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,839
how can we search across different data

364
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,839
sources and compile these? One of the

365
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,399
things we've done is a big effort uh

366
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,200
which we call data 42. It's to construct

367
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,560
a a data lake of all of our clinical

368
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,959
trials data uh over essentially the last

369
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,560
20 to 30 years of Novatis. So we have

370
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,279
huge uh clinical trials database and in

371
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,760
many cases with uh all of the health

372
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,440
records, biomarkers, what trial were the

373
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,360
people in, how did they respond, were

374
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,320
there any safety issues. So this is

375
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,959
incredibly uh helpful for when we go and

376
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,560
try and understand new problems. If a

377
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,720
safety issue comes up, we can see

378
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,440
whether it's happened before. Uh and we

379
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,279
can do our own uh sort of studies

380
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,160
reversing information from clinical

381
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,240
trials back into the research uh

382
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,000
portfolio. But as you know, you know,

383
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,600
those of you, I'm sure everybody here,

384
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
what we're looking for are these strong

385
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,959
genetic associations whe and trying to

386
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,920
understand uh whether mutations, what is

387
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,399
their functional consequence uh and

388
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
doing a lot of work on that in silico

389
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,519
which is informed by things like

390
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,920
alphafold where you can map mutations

391
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,600
onto a protein and predict it as well as

392
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,040
actually of course doing the wet lab

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,279
work which at the end of the day is

394
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,040
something you always do have to do. more

395
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,279
complicated is all of these mutations

396
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
that are in the non-coding regions. You

397
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,360
know, what are they doing? How do you

398
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639
understand their

399
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,680
function? So, it's really about closing

400
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,079
that gap between these genetic

401
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,920
associations and the mechanism. And um

402
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,760
well, this is a really great example

403
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,839
which I haven't sort of put a slide on,

404
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,440
but I probably should have done. Uh SLC

405
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,959
308. So this is a zinc transporter

406
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,480
protein and a G-W was study was

407
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,240
published to say that this was

408
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,160
associated with your risk of getting

409
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,760
type two diabetes but there wasn't it

410
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
was literally at that sort of level just

411
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,760
a whole load of genes associated with

412
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
type two diabetes working with uh

413
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,959
collaborators in other pharma companies

414
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,800
as well as the hospitals in Pakistan um

415
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,199
100,000 uh people in Pakistan we have

416
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,680
their whole exom sequencing we're able

417
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,320
to look and see were there any people

418
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,320
who had mutations in this protein

419
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,040
And actually within that cohort there

420
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,600
were 15 human knockouts of this and that

421
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,920
ranged from homozygote total knockouts

422
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,880
through to heterrozygot and different

423
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,800
degrees of loss of function. And we then

424
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,519
were able to call those people into the

425
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,199
hospitals and study their glucose levels

426
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
as well as do glucose tolerance tests.

427
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,680
Turned out if you had a loss of function

428
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,680
of this protein zinc transporter protein

429
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,279
you had reduced basil glucose levels.

430
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,959
But in the glucose tolerance test, you

431
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,399
were much better at mounting an insulin

432
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,560
response. So this really helped to

433
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,639
validate that initial G-W was study in

434
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,880
humans uh both from the point of view

435
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,560
this could be a good target in diabetes,

436
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,240
but also it's safe. There are human

437
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,680
knockouts, perfectly healthy walking

438
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,600
around. So that really gives us

439
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,279
confidence to go forward in a target

440
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
like that and beautiful when you can

441
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,360
actually get this gene dependent

442
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,600
correlation with function which we saw

443
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
in this case.

444
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
So, I'm now going to give two little uh

445
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
snapshots of a few things that we're

446
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,680
doing. First of all, in the neuroscience

447
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
area and then in the kidney area in

448
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,440
honor of Anna, I thought that would be a

449
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,360
good one to pick. U so starting off in

450
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,519
in the neuromuscular diseases and I

451
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,639
think the I'm trained in neuroscience.

452
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,480
These are the ones that I think

453
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,360
especially in children are are some of

454
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,399
the most heartbreaking diseases and ones

455
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,360
that really can either be fatal or cause

456
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,040
lifelong um disability. So the disease

457
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm just going to uh tell you about is

458
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,959
shakcomar tooth disease uh CMT-1A

459
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
disease and this is u actually

460
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,520
relatively common it's one of the most

461
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,400
common uh inherited neuromuscular

462
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,959
disorders uh and it's due to uh not a

463
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,439
mutation but actually a gene duplication

464
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,079
in this protein

465
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,240
PMP22 which is a myelin protein and it's

466
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,760
interesting there are diseases also with

467
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,760
the same protein where you get a loss of

468
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,679
function but either gain of function or

469
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,440
loss of function function results in

470
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,480
abnormal uh myelin and so then you get

471
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,720
uh abnormal axonal con uh impulses

472
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,360
delayed conduction and in these uh

473
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,160
people what happens is uh in early

474
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,080
childhood or adolescence uh these this

475
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,679
is really most important in peripheral

476
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,840
nerves um you get tingling and then uh

477
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,919
you know loss of proper muscular tone

478
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,679
and function uh in arms uh wrists and in

479
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,919
legs so then it causes problems with

480
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,240
walking and and trying to be involved in

481
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,720
sport and the disease does progress uh

482
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
over the

483
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,919
lifetime. So one of the ways where given

484
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,360
that this is a gene duplication of

485
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,120
course what you want to do is knock down

486
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,480
the gene but back to normal levels. You

487
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,240
don't want to knock it out completely

488
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,760
and this is much easier to get the

489
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,799
titration of a knockdown uh with an SA

490
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,480
than it would be with a gene therapy. So

491
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,559
this is a technology but we need to

492
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
deliver that sirna to the right tissue.

493
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,200
It's not the liver. We need to deliver

494
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,760
it to the motor neurons. Uh and so this

495
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,799
is a company we acquired DTX based in

496
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,840
San Diego. They had developed uh the a

497
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,640
libraries of lipids uh which could be

498
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,559
conjugated to sirna and then those

499
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,039
different lipids would actually be taken

500
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,760
up preferentially into different cell

501
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,360
types and and you could select out the

502
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,160
lipid conjugates for different cell

503
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,080
types but also lipid liver dtargeted.

504
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,559
And we call this the Falcon platform

505
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,640
fatty acid lipid conjugated. Uh an

506
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,960
example here isn't from the CMT-1

507
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,120
program. This is actually for delivering

508
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,480
to the CNS tow proteins. This is for

509
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Alzheimer's disease. And you can see

510
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,799
really nice knockdown of tow right

511
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,480
across different uh neurons in the

512
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,240
brain. So going back to shomar tooth

513
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
again further validation. We've got the

514
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,600
genetics which is pretty clear, but

515
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,360
let's just check if silencing PMP22 or

516
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,400
at least knocking it down in a mouse

517
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,320
model of CMT1 will give you the expected

518
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
functional benefit that you would be

519
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,280
looking for. This also helps guide what

520
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,520
you want to measure in the clinical

521
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,880
studies. So what you've got here is a

522
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,400
mouse model. It has an overexpression of

523
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,320
PMP22. So pretty similar to the human

524
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,880
disease. Uh has the same sort of

525
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,039
phenotype. It has it from birth. Starts

526
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,640
to develop muscle weakness. Uh and you

527
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,480
can look there. I don't know if this has

528
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,280
a it probably doesn't have a pointer but

529
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,760
anyway you can see um uh that those

530
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,000
sections are through the nerve fibers.

531
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,640
So you've got the wild type big thick

532
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,360
myelin insulation around and then in the

533
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,840
disease a loss of the myelin but also

534
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,760
then axonal loss as well. And then uh

535
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,520
down in the bottom right hand corner. So

536
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,080
that's the treatment with the sa for

537
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,240
PMP22 you get remielination or or

538
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,880
reduction in loss of myelination and

539
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,760
axonal protection. This improves nerve

540
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,000
function uh and it also most importantly

541
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,320
improves locomotive function in this

542
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,400
case in the mice by beam walking or grip

543
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,080
strength. And these same measures all of

544
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,840
these you can use in the clinical

545
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,280
study. So this is the the candidate

546
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,799
molecule that we've designed

547
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,400
EDK060. Uh and so this is an SRA to

548
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,120
PMP22 with a lipid conjugate that

549
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,559
delivers it to neuromuscular tissue. uh

550
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,760
and again this is now taking that exact

551
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,919
molecule into an animal model but now

552
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,799
you've got to put in the human gene. So

553
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,400
this is overexpressing human PMP21 and

554
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,799
you can see exactly pretty much similar

555
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,679
data to what I showed you in the last

556
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:00,799
experiment. Uh reversal of the uh loss

557
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,120
of myelination axonal loss really nice

558
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,880
again this nice dose dependent dose

559
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,960
titration which is going to be very

560
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,120
important when we go into the clinic. Uh

561
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,600
again dose related improvement in nerve

562
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,440
conduction uh and in the grip strength.

563
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,799
So this is at the point where we

564
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,240
literally are about to go into the

565
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,360
clinic and we'll be measuring all of

566
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,760
these same end

567
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:25,600
points. Okay. So let's switch now uh to

568
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,000
kidney diseases uh and uhacopan

569
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,240
uh which is a molecule that we've now

570
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,679
brought forward as a drug uh to the

571
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,000
clinic. Fabouta is its uh name. So the

572
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,799
node here if I'll call it that is the

573
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,880
complement pathway. compliment pathway

574
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,039
is I think one of well one of the most

575
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,760
interesting and complicated pathways

576
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,559
really fundamental uh to our immune

577
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,480
system our innate immune system uh 50

578
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,200
different proteins all very carefully

579
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,039
coordinated and in a cascade and of

580
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,679
course this this coordination of all

581
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,320
these proteins a lot can go wrong uh if

582
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,360
you have mutations in these that alter

583
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,799
this carefully coordinated uh process

584
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,039
then you're you are going to have

585
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,039
compliment mediated problems maybe you

586
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,679
don't mount a proper immune response and

587
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,000
you're susceptible to infection or maybe

588
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,559
you have an overactivation off of the

589
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,760
compliment pathway and so a whole range

590
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,440
of genetics associates different

591
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,080
polymorphisms deficiencies in the whole

592
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,240
range of compliment genes in a whole

593
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,760
range of disorders. Now there's multiple

594
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,840
complement pathways but the one we're

595
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,000
most interested in is the alternate

596
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,799
pathway uh known as AP for short uh and

597
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,880
the drug that we've been working on you

598
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,000
can see there works as an inhibitor of

599
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,320
factor B that's part of the C3 convert

600
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,720
so it forms the enzyme that creates the

601
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,039
downstream cascade and ideally I think

602
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,120
in nodes Anna you probably agree you

603
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,120
want to hit up at the top of a pathway

604
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,440
because then you can cover everything

605
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,200
down below it so that's Why we think in

606
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
this case hitting factor B is a good

607
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
idea rather than going down to the

608
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
things at the bottom. And the

609
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,799
alternative pathway genes are associated

610
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,320
with the range of diseases here. Macular

611
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,559
degeneration

612
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,080
uh number of different kidney diseases

613
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,840
uh and and other uh hemolytic

614
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,440
disorders. So just focusing in on what

615
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,000
is the evidence for the alternate

616
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,320
pathway complement pathway in these two

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,080
kidney diseases. First disease on the

618
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,320
right this is C3 which stands for

619
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,960
compliment. So probably is related to

620
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,960
the compliment pathway C3 glomealopathy.

621
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,440
Now these patients many of them do have

622
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,760
direct genetics of overactivation of the

623
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,679
compliment system. But some of them have

624
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,600
acquired the disease through auto

625
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,440
antibodies that are activating at the

626
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,760
complement pathway. But basically when

627
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,919
you do a kidney biopsy what you what you

628
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,400
see is a whole load of accumulation of

629
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,480
compliment proteins in the glomeulus.

630
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,679
They basically act to block up the

631
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,360
filter. uh and so you get an

632
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,840
accumulation uh of protein and

633
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,080
proteinura and that triggers then kidney

634
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,159
damage. Another disease which I'll say

635
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,440
more about a bit about later but I just

636
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,360
want to show you again the compliment

637
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,679
here. This is different. It's not driven

638
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,600
by compliment that isn't the the this

639
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,200
the uh driver of the disease from the

640
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,520
genetic point of view. In fact in this

641
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,919
case interestingly the genetics shows

642
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,000
certain complement polymorphisms are

643
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,640
protective in the disease. It turns out

644
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,120
that compliment is downstream of this

645
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,080
disease. Uh the actual cause of it is to

646
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,000
do with it's an autoimmune disease. Um

647
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,279
but then you get compliment activation

648
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
that adds to the disease. But

649
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,559
nevertheless, compliment is still the

650
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,480
green accumulating uh in in the

651
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:37,360
glomeila. Uh and patients have elevated

652
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,039
compliment um proteins especially the

653
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,039
the downstream ones showing compliment

654
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:45,039
activation. So, LNPO23

655
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,840
uh this is what tacapan was called while

656
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,760
it was still in the lab. Uh this is an

657
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,200
inhibitor very nice inhibitor again

658
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,200
optimized by structure-based design oral

659
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,600
molecule very potent and this is now a a

660
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,600
model in rats. It's a general model of

661
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,760
glomearul and nephritis. What you do is

662
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,279
you actually take renal extra I looked

663
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,799
up this model carefully so I could

664
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
understand it before I came to tell you

665
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,320
about it. You take, you know, extracts

666
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,720
of the kidney, inject it into rabbits,

667
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,799
and you get a a polyclonal antibbody

668
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,840
response. When you inject that back in,

669
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,120
of course, those uh antibodies basically

670
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,679
go straight and block up again the

671
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,159
glomerilus cause uh a lot of damage very

672
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,279
similar to those uh you know human

673
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,799
diseases. And so you get protein ura uh

674
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,360
es increasing over time after this anti-

675
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,200
FX1A injection. And what you can see in

676
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,679
the blue lines is this is now treating

677
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,919
with hippacapan really reducing the

678
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,520
protein ura. And what's interesting is

679
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
it will actually work whether you give

680
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,840
it be after the antibbody has been

681
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,919
given. So after the disease is ongoing

682
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,520
but it can also be preventative and

683
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,520
prophylactic. Now that's important when

684
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,840
we start to think about when would this

685
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,679
drug work. So normally you'll start in

686
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,279
clinical trials in later stage disease

687
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,200
but those people have already lost a lot

688
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,960
of their kidney function. So ideally you

689
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
want to move it into early disease as

690
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,279
quickly as possible and stop people

691
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,799
losing uh their their kidney

692
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:11,840
function. So now going into the clinical

693
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,919
trial. This is in the C3G

694
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,520
uh and the panel on the left. I won't go

695
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,480
into too much detail but this basically

696
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,039
confirms that C3G is definitely due to

697
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,200
activation of the alternative pathway.

698
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,279
You can distinguish that through EGTA

699
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,919
and EDTA, but also shows that

700
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,000
LMPO23 can really normalize all of these

701
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,400
uh complement fragments uh within the

702
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,200
serum and most importantly then produce

703
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,559
this really nice reduction in proteinura

704
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,720
uh over time actually 45% reduction uh

705
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:47,120
over this uh 80-day trial.

706
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,880
So then going back to iigan and this is

707
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,039
really the most common form of of

708
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,600
primary glomer rulan nephritis. Now what

709
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,039
happens here is that certain people for

710
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,120
some reason and there is some genetics

711
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:01,039
here produce galactose deficient

712
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,880
antibodies uh galactose deficient IgA.

713
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,400
So they're not glycosillating those

714
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,000
antibodies properly but the antibodies

715
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
are fine. They're fine and you could go

716
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
around with that and you wouldn't even

717
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,080
get the disease. But then certain people

718
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,159
who have those some of those people also

719
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,960
have certain aspects of their immune

720
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,520
system. Maybe it's HLA related or

721
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,200
whatever will form auto antibodies to

722
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,760
those uh glactose deficient uh IGAs. Now

723
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,520
you've got a horrible complex of the

724
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,080
glactose deficient AGA with now IGG big

725
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,799
complexes in your blood again blocking

726
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,720
up your kidney filtration system uh

727
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,880
causing a lot of kidney damage. Now you

728
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,520
get compliment coming in and so then the

729
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,600
compliment is adding to those complexes

730
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,080
causing more inflammatory mediators to

731
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,000
come in and really causing a lot of

732
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,159
damage within the kidney. So if you can

733
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,640
block there's different stages here. You

734
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,120
could go for a B cell therapy to try and

735
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,440
stop those auto antibodies. Um but you

736
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,360
could also try and stop the compliment

737
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,440
uh as also really another way of

738
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,120
delaying the progression of the disease.

739
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,399
uh and you can see here again in the

740
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,360
phase two study uh a really nice uh

741
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,200
impact on uh protein ura uh and also

742
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,279
really completely blocking the these

743
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,279
these compliment this is the terminal

744
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,960
part of the compliment pathway in these

745
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,440
patients. So finish up with this slide.

746
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,360
It can happen. We can get drugs for rare

747
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,840
diseases uh all the way through to

748
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,919
market. Uh and we we're really pleased

749
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,799
that we actually this year uh only a few

750
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,600
weeks ago got the first approval for uh

751
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,600
fabala as it's now called uh as an oral

752
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,320
treatment for C3G. uh and also uh we we

753
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,760
also previously got approval for I GAN

754
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,000
uh in the US and now of course we're

755
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,919
trying to uh roll this out around the

756
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,840
world but make sure these patients are

757
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,159
also getting diagnosed especially as

758
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,960
early as possible because uh a lot of

759
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,960
kidney disease can continue uh before

760
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,440
you actually get the proper diagnosis.

761
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,360
So getting that that urine test done uh

762
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,360
on a routine basis is is really

763
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,360
important.

764
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,080
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

765
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,760
That was amazing. Uh, thank you, Fiona.

766
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,200
Um, questions for Fiona before we maybe

767
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,000
we in the background we can put the

768
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,640
chairs out. Thanks, Katie. Um, any

769
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,760
questions for

770
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,039
Fiona? Uh, if no one else is asking a

771
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,360
question, I will ask a question while

772
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,640
we're putting the chairs up. Um, so I

773
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
think this, you know, thank you for

774
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
being a kidney example, but I think it

775
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,360
is like a very recent success. Um and I

776
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,960
think it it really speaks to the fact

777
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,600
that you know we've been talking about

778
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,240
all day today about the idea of you know

779
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,000
uh well-defined causal biology which of

780
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,919
course often based on genetics as you

781
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
said is a way to understand mechanisms

782
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,120
and some of our colleagues here brought

783
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,279
wonderful examples from all kinds of

784
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,200
different fields and diseases but here's

785
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,760
an example in which you actually it sort

786
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,919
of plays out right like you understand

787
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,960
maybe a more genetically defined more

788
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,559
rare entity like C3G but then actually

789
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,000
interestingly This is the story that I

790
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,440
wanted to understand better from a

791
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,880
development perspective so we can all

792
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,960
sort of understand from you how that

793
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,919
works. How is it that it was approved in

794
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,159
IgA nephropathy before C3G and how did

795
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,120
you manage the development of the drug

796
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,720
from this rare more defined entity into

797
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,840
something that's more common? Clearly it

798
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,840
had to do with your preclinical

799
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,760
development path but I'm curious if you

800
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,679
can say more about it. Obviously the uh

801
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,200
we were doing both in parallel in fact

802
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,679
because we knew that there was already

803
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,679
that strong complement biology. So it

804
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
made sense to go and and you know one of

805
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,600
the things we actually are doing in

806
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,279
farmer now is we used to just do one

807
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,960
disease at a time and then if it worked

808
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,039
in that disease then we do the next then

809
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,760
we do the next well we don't have time

810
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,520
to do that now um you know and so we try

811
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,159
and do everything in parallel which is

812
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,919
more risky but if it works then you've

813
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,320
got you know all of those indications

814
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,039
right from the beginning. So uh we did

815
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,919
start both uh at the same time but you

816
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,480
know Ian is a more common disease uh and

817
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,000
so uh it was easier then it becomes

818
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,840
easier to recruit the patients and uh so

819
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,039
you know and then you know then then

820
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,559
you're still having the discussion with

821
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,840
the regulators on what are the end

822
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,440
points uh as you know you got proteinura

823
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,760
are you going to get approval just on

824
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,880
that um is there going to be any effect

825
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,720
on renal function through GFR but of

826
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,320
course that's a very long trial in these

827
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,399
disease they are slowly progressing

828
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,320
diseases as well so you know that's

829
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,159
another consideration but you know

830
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,679
luckily and I think it makes total sense

831
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,440
because we know that proteinura is a

832
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,559
direct measure of renal function so we

833
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,640
did get approval based on that fabulous

834
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,640
oh uh Raj you have a question you can

835
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,799
ask while we're assembling our is that

836
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,039
okay assemble our panel so I'll ask uh

837
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,840
Wendy and John and David to come up if

838
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,159
you have a question you need to get

839
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,799
please do casual we're trying to be very

840
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,600
Okay, easy going here.

841
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,679
Thanks for the great talk. Um, I was

842
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,559
wondering your opinion about whether or

843
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,519
not academic labs should engage in like

844
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,200
the drug discovery development process.

845
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,360
Here, you know, we're we're good at

846
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,279
target discovery for rare disease and,

847
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,960
you know, we publish the paper, but if

848
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,240
it doesn't immediately catch fire, then,

849
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,760
you know, we start to think about, you

850
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,440
know, should we pursue finding the

851
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,120
therapy? And I don't know if you think

852
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,039
that's insurmountable. Uh, no, I don't

853
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,200
think it is insurmountable. And I mean I

854
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,880
have seen where that has been done you

855
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,480
know reasonably success well not

856
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,720
reasonably where drugs have come to

857
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,640
market just from academic institutes

858
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,840
that has happened uh particularly in the

859
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,600
cancer area actually. So and I think in

860
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,799
some of the modalities are getting

861
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,200
easier for academic labs to do. I mean I

862
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,760
I would argue an SA is probably easier

863
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,880
than trying to do all the chemistry and

864
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,640
toxicology and and all of that. So it it

865
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,039
is doable but of course you need the

866
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,880
funds from somewhere and you need to

867
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,519
have the right people brought in with

868
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,559
the right knowledge. Uh but uh it

869
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,320
certainly is doable. Yes.

870
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,840
Do you Yeah, you can ask a question.

871
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,519
You're popular. So yeah, one more

872
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,640
question. Yeah, go for it. Yeah. Hi. Um

873
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,720
you mentioned that one of the

874
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,840
applications of human genetic data could

875
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,679
be um better trial design. Yes. Um could

876
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,600
you perhaps elaborate on that also like

877
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,960
in the context of rare diseases? How

878
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,440
could human genetic data

879
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,519
Yeah. So I mean we we as I say now we

880
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,080
know with all the the G-W was studies we

881
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,720
know that people with particular um you

882
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,799
know mutations or polymorphisms may be

883
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,120
better responders to drugs or not. Uh so

884
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,960
it making a decision about which genes

885
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,960
you're going to actually have sequenced

886
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,640
as you enroll patients. Now you can

887
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,880
either do it where every it's everyone

888
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,399
comes in the trial but then you

889
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
afterwards work out what all the

890
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,279
different genetics are or you can select

891
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,440
and of course in the in the case of the

892
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,039
um the rarer diseases let's say

893
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,039
Huntington's disease is another disease

894
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,880
we're working on at the moment I mean we

895
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,919
want to understand you know what the

896
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,399
number of uh repeats exactly what their

897
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,080
status is from a genetic point of view

898
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,760
because that actually alters the rate of

899
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,919
progression of the disease as well. So

900
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,559
it is very important to understand the

901
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,399
status and uh you know even when we have

902
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,560
a drug that could alter the you know

903
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,560
isn't is mutation independent if you

904
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,879
like it's still very important to to

905
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,720
capture that information and then see

906
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,760
separately how patients with different

907
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,879
mutations uh will progress. Thank you.

908
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,879
Thank you.
