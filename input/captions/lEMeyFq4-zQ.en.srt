1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,719
Last time we talked about so one of the

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,119
things we talked about last time was

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:22,000
series. So we'll continue on that today.

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,080
So series is that you have a sequence.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,480
You're starting with a sequence. So a n

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,480
is a sequence

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,000
and then you form a new sequence. So you

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,000
form a new sequence

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,840
a new sequence

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,640
from

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,640
a uh as follows

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,480
that. So the new sequence uh let's call

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,000
that SN

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,640
and S1 is just A1.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,040
S2 is A1 + A2.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,119
S3 is A1 + A2

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,880
plus A3

18
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,840
and uh and so on.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,840
So this is the first

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,759
sum of the first n elements, right?

21
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,520
And and you typically write you

22
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,520
typically write uh sn

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,600
you write sn as the sum here from and

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,479
then in this case I'm starting at one

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,840
but you could start as something else. I

26
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:51,360
= to 1 to N of A I I

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,759
and so to say that the at so and you

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,479
write the series you also write so this

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,479
is slight beauty of notation that you

30
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,479
write

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,479
this

32
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,800
infinite sum sorry um as a series. So

33
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
you think about this as you think about

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,959
this thing here. When you write this

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,920
thing here, you're really thinking about

36
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,920
the sequence sn

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,319
and so uh so the series here the series

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,319
converge

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,280
This uh means that the sequence

40
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,239
means

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,239
that the sequence

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,840
as inn converges

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,879
right and so the most uh right so

44
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,520
remember that a sequence converts so we

45
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
by the cush convergence.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,360
[Applause]

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,360
So recall

48
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,879
by the kushi convergence

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,400
that uh that Sn

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
converge

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,280
If and only if

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,640
in this accuracy sequence,

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,159
right? And it's a C sequence just means

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,319
that if you go sufficiently far out and

55
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:05,480
you're looking at this difference here,

56
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,480
then this here is small provided

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,239
that M and N are larger than some

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,600
capital N where this here is chosen

59
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,959
depending on epsilon. Right? That's what

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,560
it means to be a cushy sequence. So like

61
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,880
in particular of course if you take so

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,880
in particular

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:39,680
if you take m

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,440
uh m to be n + one

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:48,560
sorry let me take m to be

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:53,440
um uh n minus one doesn't matter but so

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,880
if I take it like this then s n min -

68
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,280
sm. Well, this here is a sum of the

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,160
first

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:07,199
n element and from that we have to

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,240
subtract the sum of the first

72
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,440
n minus one element. So this here just

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,600
leave this here cancel out all of these

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,520
and so you're just left with a n.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,199
So,

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:27,120
so this means that if it is converging

77
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,440
right then in particular a n here has to

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,960
go to zero

79
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,280
as n goes to infinity

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,080
right because in fact this whole

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,440
difference here as long as m and n are

82
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,120
sufficiently large have to be as small

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,919
as you want right and so in particular

84
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,800
special case where where this here is

85
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,360
the one prior to that then you see that

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,919
the a end will have to go to zero right

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,720
so again if you see a series the first

88
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,440
thing you don't apply any test the first

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,960
thing that you check is that this

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,520
element here goes to zero

91
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,000
okay now

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:15,360
what are the most important series

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,360
so the most important is the geometric

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,360
series

95
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,919
and the reason it's the most important

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,520
is that it can be used to determine it's

97
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,400
easy to determine whether it's

98
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,240
converging or not and it can be used to

99
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,280
determine

100
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,560
using the test whether other series

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,600
converge. And so the geometric series is

102
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,160
that you take a sum typically here you

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
start at zero. You don't have to start

104
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,880
at zero. But of course the limit right

105
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,960
the limit if you take a series then to

106
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,600
say that it's converging mean that the

107
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,080
sequence doesn't converge

108
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,160
and the limit of these here this here is

109
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,800
also and that's where there's this abuse

110
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,199
of notation it's denoted by the same

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,840
thing. So this thing here is is uh

112
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,120
playing the role of the sequence but

113
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,919
it's also denoting the limits. Okay,

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,759
that's just a standard thing.

115
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,759
So in this case I was starting from one.

116
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,240
Okay. So now the geometric series is

117
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,960
where you take some number C and then

118
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,479
you multiply it by itself. This is some

119
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,560
real number and you multiply it by

120
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,599
itself with itself I times and where i

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,800
runs from zero to infinity right and

122
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,039
when i is zero this is meant to be one

123
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
okay

124
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,639
and the reason why I want to do it here

125
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,720
at zero is that

126
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,919
that it's probably worth remembering

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,120
that this here it's easy to deduce But

128
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,560
it's such a standard fact that it's that

129
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,280
this here is this here is converging. So

130
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,680
it's converge.

131
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,879
So the geometric series converges

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,560
provided that the absolute value of C is

133
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:27,440
less than one. And when it is this here

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:31,360
is a limit. Okay. If so then you can ask

135
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,360
if C here is equal to

136
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,159
is one

137
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,320
right so if C is actually equal to one

138
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,959
not just the absolute value but if C is

139
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,120
actually equal to one then it's just one

140
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,760
times itself a number of times but that

141
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,040
does not go to zero right so that's

142
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,360
clearly this diverging and if it's minus

143
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,680
one multiply itself by number of time

144
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,000
then it's just alternate between one and

145
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,440
minus one so it doesn't go to zero. So

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,040
it's divergent here.

147
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,600
And in fact, if as long as C here is

148
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,480
bigger equal to the absolute value is

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
bigger equal to one because you take

150
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,000
this number and multiply it by itself a

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,480
number of times. If C the absolute value

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,399
of C is bigger than one, then it

153
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,399
actually is even blowing up. It becomes

154
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,720
larger and larger, right? In absolute

155
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,640
value, right? So it's it's divergent

156
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,560
here and it's converging. So that was

157
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,560
kind of easy, right? And it was easy to

158
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,279
determine why we did there was this

159
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,160
little trick will determine what this

160
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,720
limit was, right?

161
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,519
And this is like a trick that go back I

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,080
think certainly to the ancient Greeks. I

163
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,720
mean this idea and you can do this with

164
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,200
various other thing this things about

165
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,120
adding things in different order kind of

166
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,279
stuff or multiplying by something.

167
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,360
Okay. So that was the most important and

168
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,279
again we'll come back to why it is the

169
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,160
most important but it's because it can

170
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,160
be used to determine whether other

171
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:13,200
series converge or not. another

172
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:18,000
classical but that sits inside a family

173
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,680
of uh of um of series is the harmonic

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,120
series.

175
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,680
So this is an example of of a series

176
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,480
it's it's one

177
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,800
uh series that sits inside a larger

178
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,920
family of series.

179
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,839
And so the harmonic series is when you

180
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,880
take one / n and you're summing here

181
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,519
right like that right this series here

182
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,519
and we we saw that last time is

183
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,519
divergent

184
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:55,240
and in fact the larger series that is

185
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,240
sitting inside is so sits inside

186
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,000
a larger family

187
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,720
and that larger family is where you're

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,680
summing from 1 to infinity of 1 / n to

189
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,800
the alpha and here alpha is taken to be

190
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,120
bigger equal to one

191
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,839
and so in a case where alpha is equal to

192
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,519
one that's a harmonic series this one's

193
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,320
diverge but if alpha and so this here is

194
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,360
for alpha equal to one it's diverg

195
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,360
because it's the harmonic series

196
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,519
and when alpha is strictly bigger than

197
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,160
one. Well, we just last time we just saw

198
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,120
one example of this when alpha was equal

199
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,079
to two and we saw that that converge.

200
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,519
But in fact you can prove that for any

201
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,519
alpha strictly bigger than one it does

202
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,519
converge.

203
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,760
And the typical thing to use there is is

204
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,440
and we'll talk about that at some later

205
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,920
lecture is the what's called the

206
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,920
integral test.

207
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
Okay.

208
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,560
Now,

209
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,920
now there's

210
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:25,240
uh when you have a series

211
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,240
then most but not all

212
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,320
most test

213
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,240
but but again not all uh determine

214
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,440
really whether the series is what's

215
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,200
called absolutely convergent.

216
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,720
So what is absolute convergent? We

217
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,519
talked about that last time, but let me

218
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,440
remind you

219
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,440
absolute

220
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
convergence.

221
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,399
So if you take a series here

222
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,160
then here is absolutely convergent is

223
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,160
absolutely converging.

224
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,800
This just means it means

225
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,079
that uh the series where you're slapping

226
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:26,760
on absolute value. So this thing here

227
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,760
means that this series here is converted

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,880
and so it's easy to see. So, so easy

229
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,639
to see and we saw this last time

230
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,639
and it was just from the Kushi

231
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,639
convergence.

232
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,839
So, it's easy to see that uh absolute

233
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,839
convergence

234
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
convergence

235
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,120
implies convergence

236
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,959
but not the other way around. So Kushi

237
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
convergence theorem gives you this

238
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,360
implication

239
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,360
why it's not the case that you have the

240
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,399
other way around

241
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,399
and that is because

242
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,680
what's called the alternating series.

243
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,480
So

244
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,480
so the alternating series alternating

245
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,720
And there's something called the

246
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,240
alternating uh series tests. And but let

247
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,720
me just explain to you in words why the

248
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,240
alternating series converge. So

249
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,240
alternating harmonic series.

250
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:03,440
So if you take the series here minus1 to

251
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:08,320
the n times uh over n and you're summing

252
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,440
here from zero to sorry not to zero

253
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,600
because you're dividing by zero from one

254
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,079
to infinity this here is called the

255
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,279
alternating series

256
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,920
alternating harmonic series right if you

257
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:26,560
were slapping absolute value sign on it.

258
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,839
So, so this means that a n here is -1 to

259
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,800
the^ n / n, right? So, if you take the

260
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,639
absolute value sign, the absolute value

261
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,399
sorry of a n, then this here is just

262
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,360
one. So, this is 1 / n. So, this here is

263
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,760
the corresponding series when you're

264
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,320
slapping absolute value and this is the

265
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,320
harmonic series.

266
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,839
And this is divergent,

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,720
right? That was what we just discussed.

268
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,639
Now, why is this series here convergent?

269
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
We'll probably come back to that in a

270
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:10,759
later lecture in a more general setting,

271
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,759
but let me just explain this.

272
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,120
And so the idea is

273
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,360
that before you're starting summing,

274
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,240
so imagine that you have here before you

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,959
start your sum, then you're sort of in a

276
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,720
neutral position, which is one zero,

277
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:35,600
sorry. And then you do the first then

278
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,839
you do the first thing this you're

279
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,279
looking at S1,

280
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:45,360
right? But s1 would bring you down,

281
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:49,120
right? Because s1 is just equal to min

282
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,079
-1 to the^ 1. But that's minus one. So

283
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,839
it's minus1 / n. This is the first

284
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,320
element.

285
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,680
So that's going to bring you down. Let

286
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:04,160
me just kind of exaggerate the picture

287
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,600
and bring you down here to minus one / n

288
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,199
at minus one over. This is n is equal to

289
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,959
one. So this is minus one.

290
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:18,959
This is how the series starts, right?

291
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:22,799
And so the next element is s_2 but

292
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:27,039
s_ub_2 is -1. That was the first element

293
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,720
and then plus and then min -1

294
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,240
squared

295
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,520
over two. So this is and you would be

296
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,600
tempted but it's not. Don't add them at

297
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,200
this stage but just looking at it like

298
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,720
this.

299
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,840
Right?

300
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:48,400
So the next so this here is this here is

301
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,039
S1.

302
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,559
Let me just write it down here. This is

303
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,520
S1.

304
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,640
When you're looking at S2, then you're

305
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,880
coming back towards zero, but you don't

306
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,320
go as far up as you went down, right?

307
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,720
because it's one over uh two right so

308
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,559
this here is s2

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,840
and then you see the next one is the

310
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:21,120
next one if you start here then you are

311
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:28,880
supposed to so for s3 it's really s2

312
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:32,480
+ -1 to ^ 3 over 3 so this is s2

313
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,840
minus right because -1 to the^ 3 is a

314
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,720
negative sign like that. Right? So the

315
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,200
next one here

316
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
so you're starting here before you have

317
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,240
done any summation you're starting at

318
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,600
zero you brought down here you come up

319
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,000
here and then but then in S3 you're

320
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,240
going down but you don't go as far down

321
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,720
as the previous one. So you're going

322
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,799
down here and so you're really

323
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
continuing this process and you see that

324
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,280
these interval get smaller and smaller

325
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,760
and it just go down and then it come up

326
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,880
but it doesn't go up as far up as you

327
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,760
were before and then so on so forth and

328
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,160
so you can make this more precise. It's

329
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,200
it's quite easy and this show you that

330
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,600
this series is converging and in fact

331
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,240
this is like the basis for this

332
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,880
alternating series test and it works as

333
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,000
long as you have alternating where the

334
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,640
sign of the a ends are alternating and

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,960
the absolute value goes to zero in this

336
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,799
here that's alternating series test case

337
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,400
I'll probably come back to that at some

338
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:42,360
later stage but this just show you that

339
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,360
if you take a series

340
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,679
you know then um so the absolute

341
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,160
convergence means that if you slap

342
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,760
absolute value sign then that new series

343
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,600
also converge absolute convergence imply

344
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,320
convergence but not the other way

345
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,400
around.

346
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:06,160
Okay. So now the next thing

347
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,799
um is that so the next thing is like if

348
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,799
you take a series

349
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,600
Suppose you take a series and suppose

350
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,120
that you knew

351
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,120
that. So suppose you have a series like

352
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
this

353
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:32,280
and you knew that a end here all of the

354
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,280
a were non- negative fall in

355
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,000
then convergence here convergence

356
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:47,520
just imply right so convergence is

357
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:51,400
because the sn is now the sum sum here

358
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,400
of these guys here,

359
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,000
right? That's SN.

360
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,080
And you see that this is of course less

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,960
or equal to because all of these guys

362
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,039
are non negative. It's less or equal to

363
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,400
where you're summing

364
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,880
not just up to n but one more right

365
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,679
because this here is non- negative and

366
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,880
so this here is SN + one. So you see

367
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,200
that if the elements are non- negative

368
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,600
then the sequence

369
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:25,120
sn is so sn is monotum

370
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,320
nondereasing the sequence and so to say

371
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,840
by the monot convergence theorem to say

372
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:38,280
that this sequence sn is convergent is

373
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,280
equivalent to saying that so sn converge

374
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,320
if and only If

375
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,120
SN is bounded from above,

376
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,039
right?

377
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,440
Okay. So now

378
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,200
when you have a series and you have

379
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:11,200
already checked that a n goes to zero

380
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,520
and you are then asked to determine

381
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,200
whether the series is converging or not

382
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,520
right then there are these number of

383
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,320
tests right and so there's a bunch of

384
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,320
tests so test

385
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,240
for convergence

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And so there's a bunch of them and and

387
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,520
let me talk about uh in this lecture

388
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,520
I'll just talk about the comparison test

389
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,880
and I mentioned them very briefly but

390
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,280
uh last time but I'll talk a little bit

391
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,280
more about them and then there's a ratio

392
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,280
test

393
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,600
uh and then there is the root test. So

394
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,280
I'll talk about those three but there

395
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,280
are other tests. So root test.

396
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,400
Okay. Now

397
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,240
um

398
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,600
Okay. So now let's start with the with

399
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,559
the comparison test and there are like

400
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,559
two versions of this.

401
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,360
One version is the following

402
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,919
that suppose that you have so uh

403
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,919
comparison test

404
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,919
uh version one.

405
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,640
And so the first version of the

406
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,840
comparison test is the following that

407
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,080
imagine that you have two series here a

408
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,400
and again we talked about this last time

409
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,360
but but let me just say a few more words

410
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,960
that you have this series and you have

411
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:11,039
that series and I'm assuming here that

412
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,960
the a and the bn

413
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,000
are non- negative numbers and in fact

414
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm assuming that bn is larger equal to

415
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,320
a n.

416
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,320
Then the comparison test this version

417
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,679
the simple version of the comparison

418
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,480
test is that if

419
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,000
this here

420
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:36,360
if

421
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,360
the series based on the BN is convergent

422
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,480
then the series

423
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,720
of the ends is also converted.

424
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,279
And so this is so the this version of

425
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,559
the comparison test is used both in this

426
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,600
way but it's also used sometimes where

427
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,679
you know that this series is divergent

428
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,279
and from that you conclude that this one

429
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,679
right that's just a negation of the

430
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,400
statement right

431
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,640
so um

432
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:23,360
okay so let's See it's this it's so that

433
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:28,320
prove here is of that is is is actually

434
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:31,520
easy and so why is this the case?

435
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,559
Well, the thing is

436
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,200
that you know so that by the Kushi

437
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:41,159
convergence

438
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,159
by the Kushik convergence.

439
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,440
Um we just we know that to determine

440
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,640
whether all we need to check to to

441
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:01,919
determine whether this sequence here is

442
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:04,240
convergent. All we need to figure out is

443
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,320
if the

444
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,120
if the if it is a cushy sequence, right?

445
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,279
So this means that you want to say that

446
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:20,640
so so suppose you're looking at

447
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:24,400
at the series the the sequence sorry um

448
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:31,000
defined from a and so this is just where

449
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm now summing the first n elements

450
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,919
in a and I just want to

451
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,200
write some using the

452
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,720
superscript a just to to say to to to

453
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,120
denote that it's coming from the

454
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,880
sequence a n. So if you're looking at

455
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:53,080
this and so likewise I

456
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,080
we look at this thing here.

457
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:05,840
Now of course you have that suppose

458
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:09,120
you're looking at S N A minus S M A. You

459
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,760
want to show that this here you want to

460
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,600
show that this here is a C sequence. So

461
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,600
you're looking at this difference here,

462
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,520
right? But this thing here is just this

463
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,720
here difference. I'm assuming that m is

464
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,360
less than n straight strictly less than

465
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,520
m n sorry this here just means that this

466
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,720
difference here is just when you're

467
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:40,840
summing where you're summing from m +

468
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,840
one. So this is just the a m + one

469
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,559
up to a n this is just this

470
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,640
>> fine. Yeah,

471
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,840
>> when we're proving to learn this like

472
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,279
this now um just like to get some

473
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,360
motivation like the reason that we're

474
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,960
using sequences

475
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,720
>> I you could either use at this stage you

476
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,039
could either use cushy sequence that's

477
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,080
what I started you could also have used

478
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,200
the mono convergence here maybe that was

479
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
>> okay because I was just going to say

480
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,760
like back to the definition of

481
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,799
convergence that we just had where we

482
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,679
had like yeah absolute value of

483
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,440
>> yeah that's right

484
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,919
>> is that is it just like

485
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,159
>> so so if you if you went all the way

486
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,240
back to the definition, right? Then you

487
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,640
would have to determine what the limit

488
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,520
was,

489
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,440
>> right? Which we don't want

490
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,279
>> and we don't want because we don't know,

491
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,600
right? Just because we may know what the

492
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,679
limit of B of the sequence based on B

493
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,520
is, but we don't. But this doesn't mean

494
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,080
that you can figure out what the limit

495
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,480
of the A.

496
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,919
>> So does that motivate why like sequences

497
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,039
are like more useful in general?

498
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,640
>> Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's

499
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,559
right. Exactly. That's right. That's

500
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,880
right. So the advantage with cushi

501
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,720
sequence is that you don't have to

502
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,200
figure out what the limit is and and

503
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,279
it's often I mean like in this case you

504
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
have no idea I mean you know it's not

505
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,240
it's not in terms of anything from the

506
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,480
bees right and and I should but let me

507
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,360
just continue doing it like this but

508
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,679
just now when you ask I should probably

509
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,679
have done it using the monotone

510
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,000
convergence theorem but you can do that

511
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,880
as an exercise but it doesn't matter I

512
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,159
mean So

513
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,559
the difference here is

514
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,399
this is what the difference is the

515
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,080
absolute value signs are really

516
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,000
irrelevant because these are all non-

517
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,760
negative numbers. So I don't have to

518
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,399
have the absolute value sign

519
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,880
and now this thing here is of course

520
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,600
less than but this here is less than the

521
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,600
corresponding B's

522
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,279
and this is like less than the

523
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,679
corresponding

524
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,799
B here like that.

525
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:50,320
But this here is exactly S N

526
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:52,720
the one based on B S M based on B and

527
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,640
this here as long as N and M are

528
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
sufficiently large we can make this as

529
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,679
small as we want. So therefore this here

530
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,600
was as small as we want. Right?

531
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,760
You could also have done it maybe let's

532
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,960
just say that that you could also have

533
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:13,919
done it using the mono convergence

534
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:17,679
right because now of course you have

535
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:21,679
that again the same sort of thing say

536
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:27,360
that if you take the sn based on the a

537
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:30,159
so that's a1 up to a n sum of these guys

538
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,960
but these individually is less than the

539
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
corresponding b's

540
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:41,600
And this here is just the s the sequence

541
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:45,600
sn based on the piece right but these

542
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,520
here if this se these here converge this

543
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,240
is equivalent to saying that they are

544
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:56,279
bounded they're less than some c some

545
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,279
real number c and this here is for all a

546
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,480
for all in sorry right but this means of

547
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,760
course that Those things here are bound

548
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,039
fall in right. So, so then you know and

549
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,919
this here is a mono also a monotom

550
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,399
sequence mono increasing sequence that

551
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,320
is now bounded from above. So therefore

552
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,799
it converts.

553
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,399
So you can do it either of those two

554
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,799
ways but so that's really easy to check.

555
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,000
Let's see an example where we are using

556
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,000
this test here.

557
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Um

558
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,320
and so

559
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,640
so this could be that you're looking at

560
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,519
something like

561
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,679
um you're looking at so here's an

562
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,320
example.

563
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,200
Um

564
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,880
uh you're looking at a series that is 2

565
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,960
to the minus n / n

566
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,440
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

567
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

568
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,519
=

569
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,279
1 to infinity.

570
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,399
Uh this is your this is and and you you

571
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,320
want so you you you're being asked is

572
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,600
this

573
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,600
is this uh series

574
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,600
convergent?

575
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,720
Okay, so this is like typically how it

576
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,200
works.

577
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,320
And so of course in this case you should

578
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,760
think about the the that this here is a

579
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,960
sequence a n right and so you have to

580
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,760
find the bn right but in this case we

581
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,760
just say so we're setting a so set so

582
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,760
answer

583
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:52,159
set

584
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:55,760
a n = 2 to the minus n / 2 and bn

585
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,780
= to 2 - n.

586
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,159
Then

587
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:02,799
[Applause]

588
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:07,200
then uh then you have that a n is bigger

589
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:09,279
equal to zero is smaller than bn

590
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,679
and

591
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,679
and this sequence here based on the bn

592
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,679
oops

593
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,080
is a convergent

594
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,200
geometric series.

595
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,120
It's convergent between because because

596
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:41,200
c here in this case is 1 /2, right? It's

597
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,000
1 / two. So it's just, you know, 1 / two

598
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,360
1 a half is the same as 2 to the minus

599
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,799
one, right?

600
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,120
And so this is convergent.

601
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,679
Okay.

602
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,000
So this is just so so you know so

603
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,080
typically you know this could be used to

604
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,799
that you're given a sequence and you are

605
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,640
being asked is it convergent or not and

606
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,399
so you have to find the se sorry and you

607
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,119
being asked whether it's convergent or

608
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,639
not and you have to find the comparison

609
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,599
series

610
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:21,919
and then uh and then in this case right

611
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:26,240
say that this thing here right is is uh

612
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:29,200
is a convergent and uh and so therefore

613
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,359
the sequence a n that was squeezed

614
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,359
between that and zero was also

615
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,359
convergent.

616
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,560
Okay, so this was the first version of

617
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,079
the comparison test.

618
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,440
Here is another

619
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:52,679
more fancy version of comparing where

620
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,679
you're comparing two series.

621
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,000
In fact, it's pretty much like that

622
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,520
except for for this stuff we talked

623
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,920
about.

624
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,079
I mean, typically um typically the tests

625
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,960
are where you comparing it with some

626
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,599
other series.

627
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,839
So here is version two.

628
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,839
So comparison

629
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,040
uh version two.

630
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:31,359
Okay.

631
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,760
And so you have again two series and

632
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,760
and and again it doesn't matter this

633
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,480
what the sum is matters where you

634
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,280
starting but whether or not it converges

635
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,000
doesn't matter where you start.

636
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,640
So suppose that you have the series and

637
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,640
you have this series

638
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,320
and suppose that you know

639
00:35:51,520 --> 00:36:00,000
that uh the the bn

640
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:04,560
none of the bns are zero.

641
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,160
uh and you know that the a n divided by

642
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,760
bn

643
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:15,440
that this ratio here as n goes to

644
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:21,280
infinity converts to some l and l here

645
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:23,040
is um l here is um is not zero and it's

646
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,160
not infinity

647
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,040
meaning that it really is a limit

648
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,540
like that.

649
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:36,960
So if that's the case then the serious

650
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,960
[Applause]

651
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,359
um

652
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,359
then

653
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,380
right let's

654
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,380
[Applause]

655
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,480
right then uh let's have these as non-

656
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,480
negative numbers

657
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:04,960
uh then uh Um

658
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:07,960
then uh then the series uh a

659
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,960
converge

660
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,560
uh if and only if

661
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,280
the series and converge.

662
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,440
Okay.

663
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,800
Um and so a an example of this, a

664
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,079
typical example like of this is where

665
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:45,680
you're looking at the series

666
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:48,400
uh 1 / n squar minus one. Suppose you're

667
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,720
looking at this and now just to make it

668
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,359
so that make sure that it makes sense

669
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,640
that you're not dividing by zero. You're

670
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,200
looking at this thing here.

671
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,400
Suppose that this is the series that

672
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,839
you're given.

673
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, this here is so you wouldn't use

674
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,520
the first compar although you could have

675
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,160
used the first but then it would be a

676
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,599
little bit more uh complicated. Not

677
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,240
super complicated but a little bit more

678
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,240
complicated because this thing here is

679
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,160
you know this is right. So the first

680
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,880
thing you observe is that this of course

681
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,800
goes to zero. this here goes to zero.

682
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,960
But the second thing is that it's very

683
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,680
close to a series that you know

684
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,640
something about. It's very close to this

685
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,320
series here.

686
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,240
But again, it doesn't matter where I'm

687
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,640
starting in order when you're asking

688
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,040
whether it's convergent or not. So it's

689
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,800
very close to this series. But of

690
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,920
course, this thing here,

691
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,480
this thing here is a smaller number. So

692
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,440
this is actually bigger than 1 / n^2,

693
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,280
right? This here is a convergence

694
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,839
sequence series, right? So this does not

695
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,640
help you. This is not great for using

696
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,240
the first test. You could have done it,

697
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,760
but then you know you could use still

698
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,839
use the first test, but then you have to

699
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,760
be slightly more clever. So

700
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:19,280
instead of that, you can use this second

701
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:24,480
test. And so in the second test you set

702
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:28,400
a n equal to 1 / n^2 minus one and you

703
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:33,440
set bn = to 1 / n^2.

704
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:38,960
And then you have that a n / bn. But

705
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:43,119
this is just 1 / n^2 - 1

706
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:47,000
over um n^2

707
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,000
1 / n^2. Sorry.

708
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,440
And so this here is the same right as

709
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,880
n^2

710
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,440
n^2 minus one right like that. And now

711
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,359
you can divide by n^2 in both

712
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,280
denominator and denominator. So you're

713
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:08,480
getting 1

714
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:11,760
uh 1 - 1 / n^2. And now you just use the

715
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,320
usual algebraic rules for limits. This

716
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,280
here converts to zero. So it means that

717
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,480
the denominator converts to one. So this

718
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,599
means that this ratio here converts to

719
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,160
to one, right? And so you see that it's

720
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,560
converging the ratio is converging to

721
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,800
something that is neither zero nor

722
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,760
infinity.

723
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,160
And this means that this series here is

724
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,240
convergent if and only if this is

725
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,240
convergent. You already know that this

726
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,359
here is convergent. So we conclude that

727
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,240
this is convergent. So that's like how

728
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,240
it's typically used.

729
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:57,119
So um

730
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,880
right so now the next s uh the next test

731
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:04,800
um I I want to talk about is the ratio

732
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,160
test. And so this is a this is I mean

733
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,359
like the comparison test are typically

734
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,079
like almost the easiest test.

735
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,079
Uh but this one here is extremely

736
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,079
useful.

737
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:26,760
And so the the next two tests,

738
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,760
the ratio test, both

739
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,079
both a ratio test

740
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,119
and root test

741
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,960
are based on

742
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,960
are based on comparison.

743
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,280
with

744
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:59,040
the geometric series.

745
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,560
And so this is explaining why

746
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,359
uh the geometric series is so crucial.

747
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,720
Okay. So what is the ratio test? Well,

748
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,520
the ratio test is simply the test that

749
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,520
if you're looking at

750
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,440
so if you have a series, you don't have

751
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,520
to look at any other series like in the

752
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,599
comparison test, you have to find

753
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,480
another series.

754
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,880
But in the ratio test, so this is a

755
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,880
ratio test.

756
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,400
So you're looking at a series

757
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,400
like this

758
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,200
and the ratio test is that you're

759
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,200
looking at uh a n

760
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,560
+ one

761
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,880
over a n. So you are looking at the

762
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:57,839
ratio between two consecutive elements

763
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,800
elements of the a right. So you're

764
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,800
looking at this

765
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,480
and you're looking at the absolute value

766
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,560
of this

767
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,520
and you're asking

768
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:14,720
if the limit here as n goes to infinity

769
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,760
suppose that the limit exist and let's

770
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:22,079
say that the limit is a

771
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:25,119
so so it it's ask is you know it's

772
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,839
asking you if this you know it's somehow

773
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,520
the test here at this form of the ratio

774
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,440
test it require

775
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,160
that the ratio here has a limit.

776
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,760
So the ratio test then say that if a

777
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,400
here

778
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,040
is um

779
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,040
if a here is

780
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,440
um

781
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,920
is uh by sorry yeah if if if a here is

782
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,240
uh less than one

783
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,720
then the series is so let me let me

784
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,720
write it like this.

785
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,400
So a

786
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,040
less than one this here means that the

787
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,040
series is convergent.

788
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:20,800
Uh true if this a here is bigger than

789
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:24,280
one this implies that the series

790
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,280
is divergence.

791
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:38,520
And three is that if this a here is one

792
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:38,520
then the test is so test is inconclusive

793
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,200
but so it's important to remember that

794
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,680
it is possible that you don't get

795
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,200
anything out of the test okay if you are

796
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,640
in the unlucky case where this limit is

797
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:57,760
one right

798
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:02,400
and it is I should also emphasize that

799
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:05,680
it is crucial to have a limit right so

800
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,280
you the test here in this form it's

801
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,280
crucial to have a limit

802
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,280
okay

803
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,960
and and we'll talk a little bit we'll

804
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,359
come back to that because we'll come

805
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,359
back to this

806
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,280
Okay. So now

807
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:38,000
let me try to explain

808
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:39,440
uh why uh why you have well in

809
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,599
conclusive I don't really need to

810
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:48,680
explain anything right but but why why

811
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,680
in the case so proof of case one

812
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:59,800
so this means that I have to show so so

813
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,800
so need to True.

814
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:12,359
That if this limit here, if this limit

815
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,359
here, if this limit

816
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:21,680
of a n + one over a n, if this here is

817
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,680
less than one, then the series is

818
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,680
converging.

819
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,200
And I'll just sketch the proof because

820
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,599
we're going to prove we're going to do

821
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,440
Yeah, I I I will just sketch the proof.

822
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,599
We sort of come back in a way to the

823
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,319
proof because it's very close to the

824
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,800
same proof that is used in the case of

825
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,800
the root test.

826
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,760
So,

827
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:59,359
so that's what I need. So I have that

828
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,520
there exist. So given

829
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:05,319
um

830
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,319
so given

831
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:15,119
uh a zero less than one. So given a z

832
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:20,640
with

833
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:22,560
a z with a z bigger than this a and less

834
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,760
than one.

835
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,800
Right? So true. So if you pick a a zero

836
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,760
that is strictly bigger than a and still

837
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,960
less than one, then we know that there

838
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,960
exist there exist

839
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,319
uh n such that

840
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:55,200
if little n is bigger than this capital

841
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:58,800
n then uh a n + one

842
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,720
over uh a n

843
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,599
and really I should have absolute value

844
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,560
here on this

845
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,119
then we have that this thing here is

846
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:13,040
less than

847
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:16,720
um it's less than a z right because uh

848
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,800
if you're very far out then this here is

849
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,520
this ratio is going to be very close to

850
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,040
this but this is strictly less than that

851
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,880
Right? So we have this, right? Okay. So

852
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,079
this means that maybe I shouldn't call

853
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,880
it a zero because there's too many A's.

854
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,839
Now let's call it something else. Let's

855
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,920
call it alpha to make it just look much

856
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,079
more distinct.

857
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,640
Uh okay.

858
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:48,160
So uh so this means that so you see that

859
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,920
if so in other words if

860
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:54,960
um if n here is bigger than this capital

861
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,800
n then you have just multiplying over

862
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:04,480
you have that a n + one is less than

863
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:06,240
alpha * a n like that right

864
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,800
in the ratio test I should have said

865
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,280
that but obviously you are assuming that

866
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,480
these a ends I'm not sure. So you can

867
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,480
divide by them. Right?

868
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,720
So you have this if you're far out you

869
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,440
have this that the next one is a

870
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,319
fraction of the previous one.

871
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,280
Right? But this means of course that if

872
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:37,359
you take if you take if you're looking

873
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:40,000
at n is bigger equal to this capital n.

874
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:45,599
Well, you have that

875
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,960
you have that a capital n + one, right?

876
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:53,040
If you're using this

877
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:57,760
a capital n as little n then you have

878
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:01,520
that this thing here this is now the um

879
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:06,319
this here is now sorry if you're using

880
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:08,480
if you if you first pick n equal to

881
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:11,040
capital n

882
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,200
then what does this inequality tell you?

883
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:19,920
tell you that a capital n + one is less

884
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:24,720
or equal to alpha a capital n.

885
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:29,359
Now apply this inequality here for n +

886
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:34,240
capital n + 1. So then you have that a

887
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:40,559
capital n + 2 absolute value is less or

888
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:42,720
equal to alpha a n + one like that.

889
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,640
Right?

890
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,400
But you already proven that this thing

891
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,319
here, forget about the alpha here, but

892
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,880
you proven this inequality. So filling

893
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:53,359
in that inequality, I have this alpha

894
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,200
here, but then I have another alpha that

895
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:59,000
is this.

896
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,000
And then like this,

897
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:07,040
right? And so now you can continue this

898
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,880
way. So this here is like alpha squared

899
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,280
time a capital. And so now you see that

900
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,660
you can continue. So if you're looking

901
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,880
at so

902
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:21,200
[Applause]

903
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:26,800
if you continue like this then you see

904
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:31,440
that a capital n plus some little m

905
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:35,520
is lesser equal to alpha to the power m

906
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,680
* a to absolute value of a n. Right?

907
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,040
This here the previous line was just

908
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:45,920
where m was equal to two but you really

909
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:48,480
get it for all integers right

910
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,119
and so this say that at least the tail

911
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,599
of this sequence here the tail of the a

912
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,319
sequence is this is just some fixed

913
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,520
constant this here is a convergent

914
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:02,400
geometric series so the tail is bounded

915
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,599
by a convergent geometric series so you

916
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,559
can just apply the first uh the first

917
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,359
comparison test to prove that the

918
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:15,440
sequence a that the series a n is

919
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:20,000
actually convergent. Okay. So, so this

920
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:24,240
so so the the the

921
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,800
ratio test again was to compare it use

922
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:31,720
the first comparison test where the

923
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,720
comparison was the geometric series.

924
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:41,760
Okay.

925
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:47,520
Um and so of course if the so this prove

926
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:51,440
this prove one two here but two is kind

927
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,119
of really the same because if this alpha

928
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,880
here

929
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,880
so to show the second part

930
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,119
again the third one to prove it's

931
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,880
inconclusive there's nothing to prove

932
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:07,440
because it leaves open any possibility

933
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,559
Uh but but you want to show that if this

934
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,559
limit here so if this limit so proof of

935
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,559
two

936
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,720
so you want so you'll be assuming that a

937
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,960
here is bigger than than one but this

938
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,800
means that there exist so if you take

939
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,520
alpha

940
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,520
so this time

941
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,480
choose

942
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:41,839
alpha such that

943
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:44,800
uh alpha is bigger than one but it's

944
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:48,319
smaller than a

945
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:52,079
but then you have that for right since

946
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:54,400
this this ratio is converging for for

947
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,880
little n bigger than there exist some

948
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,359
capital n so that if this little n is

949
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:05,280
bigger than a capital n then you have

950
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:06,880
that a n + one over a in that this thing

951
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,200
here

952
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,520
if it's far out out is going to convert

953
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,880
here but at least far enough out it's

954
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:18,000
going to be bigger than alpha right

955
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:24,559
multiplying over again

956
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:28,640
means that a n + one is bigger than

957
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:31,680
alpha * a n

958
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,559
this here is now bigger than on. And so

959
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,760
in the same way as before, you see that

960
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:41,119
if you're far enough out, then the next

961
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:45,280
element is some

962
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:47,760
multiple some some big number some at

963
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,920
least bigger than one times the previous

964
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,400
one, right? But this means that they're

965
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,960
getting larger and larger as you you

966
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,079
know from some fixed stage on and

967
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:01,119
outwards, the a ends are getting larger

968
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:04,559
and larger. So they don't converge to

969
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,480
zero as they were supposed to. Right? So

970
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,160
this is proving true, right? And three

971
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,119
again does nothing to prove because it

972
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,119
leaves open both possibilities.

973
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,800
>> Um okay.

974
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,000
>> Yeah.

975
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:27,000
>> Does that assume that the series is

976
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
increasing?

977
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,040
>> Uh

978
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:35,280
Like I guess just looking at it

979
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:38,480
>> like from a high level we're saying that

980
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,400
wait so you you're asking uh what what

981
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,960
are you asking? So for part one we say

982
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,960
that less than

983
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:50,799
that only work

984
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:53,760
>> no no so there's no assumption here on

985
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:57,680
whether the sequence is

986
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:02,000
uh right I mean so so one one yeah so

987
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:05,520
one implies that the absolute value is

988
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,359
going down as you say right yeah but it

989
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,640
could alternate signs and things like

990
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:12,799
that yeah but It's uh but it is yeah and

991
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,960
so it's just because you're comparing it

992
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,440
with you're going to compare it with a

993
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,079
convergent geometric series and in

994
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,799
convergent geometric series the next

995
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:25,920
element is some fixed fraction of the

996
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:28,559
previous one.

997
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:32,000
Yeah.

998
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,559
So, so you you're right that in order

999
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,839
for the ratio test to give you

1000
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,319
convergence, then it then it's it's

1001
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:44,880
going to require that sufficiently far

1002
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:51,640
out the absolute value of the a element

1003
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,640
is is going down. Yep. So,

1004
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,839
so the other

1005
00:56:54,319 --> 00:57:00,400
the other uh the other and this is like

1006
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:03,200
and this in a way addresses that point

1007
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:07,680
you're making there. So the other test

1008
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:11,440
that's that is also based on on

1009
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:13,920
comparing it with the geometric series

1010
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,480
but this does not compare consecutive

1011
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,760
elements. So it's leaving the

1012
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:23,920
possibility that the next element could

1013
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,680
be larger than the previous

1014
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,240
um

1015
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,200
and so this is the root test. But of

1016
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,680
course you know it it cannot be that you

1017
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,520
it cannot you know you cannot have keep

1018
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,359
having the next element larger than

1019
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,839
previous but you could have you know

1020
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:42,640
there could be somewhere where you know

1021
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,240
the next one actually went up but then

1022
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,920
presumably they're going after that

1023
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,760
they're going down at least for a long

1024
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,799
time and then maybe there's another one

1025
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:54,799
that jumps up but not very much etc.

1026
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:57,359
Right. And the root test is is is is

1027
00:57:54,799 --> 00:58:00,160
okay with that. Whereas that test wasn't

1028
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:04,960
okay with that. So the root test so this

1029
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:07,760
is so you have a series again like this

1030
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,640
and the root test is

1031
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,839
that you're looking at you're taking the

1032
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,960
absolute value of this

1033
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:20,000
and then you're taking the nth root. So

1034
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,160
this means this is the same as saying a

1035
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,079
n absolute value. If you want to write

1036
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:30,000
it like this one,

1037
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:34,640
right? So it's it's it's a dealing with

1038
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,640
this and the root test is saying that

1039
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,640
suppose

1040
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,920
that this

1041
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,319
that this when you form this here that

1042
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:50,599
this has a limit.

1043
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,599
Suppose that this nth root

1044
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:56,720
suppose that this here has a limit and

1045
00:58:53,760 --> 00:59:00,160
let's call this limit C.

1046
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:05,799
Suppose that you have this

1047
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,799
then it has the same three parts here

1048
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,640
as in the previous.

1049
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:19,440
Um

1050
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:22,480
and so this is um so this is so so

1051
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:26,079
there's three possibilities where C here

1052
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:30,040
is less than one h then this implies

1053
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,040
that the series is convergent.

1054
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,920
Uh two

1055
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:43,559
C is bigger than one implies that the

1056
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,559
series is divergent.

1057
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:52,480
And again the case where C here is equal

1058
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,200
to one in conclusion

1059
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,200
test this in conclusion

1060
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,400
and again we're going to compare with

1061
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,960
the geometric series. So let's see how

1062
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,960
the proof works.

1063
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So

1064
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:28,400
okay. So now let's prove uh one

1065
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,799
proof of one.

1066
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,559
So again we are in a situation where we

1067
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:37,280
have uh that the nth root of the

1068
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:41,440
absolute value here

1069
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:43,760
as n goes to infinity

1070
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:48,480
is equal to some c and we're assuming

1071
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:53,680
that the c is less than one right so now

1072
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:56,319
um I'm I'm again choosing something that

1073
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:00,760
is between

1074
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,760
c and one. So, choose

1075
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:09,760
uh C.

1076
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:16,799
Let's call it C 0. Um uh will

1077
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:19,760
uh C less than C 0 less than one. Okay.

1078
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:23,760
And now we know that because we have

1079
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:27,000
this limit, we know that there exist

1080
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,000
there exist

1081
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:34,880
capital n such that if little n is

1082
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:38,559
bigger than capital n

1083
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:42,000
then uh then this

1084
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:47,040
then the nth root of this absolute value

1085
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,839
sign is actually less or equal to C

1086
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:54,079
right this is just because C was

1087
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:57,599
strictly bigger than C right so we have

1088
01:01:54,079 --> 01:02:00,640
that so now we just take the nth power

1089
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:03,960
on both sides so this implies by taking

1090
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,960
n power

1091
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:09,480
the nth power

1092
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:18,799
we get that a absolute value of a n

1093
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:23,760
sorry

1094
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:26,760
is less or equal to c 0 to the power n

1095
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,760
okay

1096
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,119
right so but that's already great right

1097
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,599
because this means that you have

1098
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:39,760
compared at least from a certain stage

1099
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:41,920
and and outward you have compared the a

1100
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:46,799
with if you're thinking about that this

1101
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:50,000
thing here is like the b Right? Then

1102
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:53,520
it's you have compared this guys here

1103
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,119
with this series here based on these at

1104
01:02:53,520 --> 01:03:00,000
least from this capital n and outwards

1105
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,400
and this is a geometric series because

1106
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,200
it's just some number small strictly

1107
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:08,240
smaller than one multiplied by itself n

1108
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:11,960
times. So, so again by the first

1109
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,960
comparison test.

1110
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,680
So by the first comparison test

1111
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,640
um um the a

1112
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,039
is convergent.

1113
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,359
Right. So, and and and note here that

1114
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,039
what you're proving is you're actually

1115
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:48,240
proving that this series here is

1116
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:50,640
convergent. Right. Right. Because you're

1117
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:53,599
comparing this series here with the

1118
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,799
geometric series. But this here is just

1119
01:03:53,599 --> 01:04:00,480
and this just means

1120
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:05,559
sorry means that that the original

1121
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,559
series here was absolutely convertible.

1122
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,839
But absolute convergence means implies

1123
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:21,000
convergence. Right? So, so you are

1124
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:21,000
actually proving absolute convergence.

1125
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,599
Okay.

1126
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,720
Now let's try to again you know there's

1127
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,119
these three parts to it but the last one

1128
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,039
uh leaves open any possibility. So

1129
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,799
there's nothing to prove. So let's just

1130
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:39,119
prove the second part here and that's

1131
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:42,640
just goes similarly

1132
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:45,839
and again the this it fails dramatically

1133
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,319
to be convergence because the

1134
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:54,760
a n as we'll see does not actually goes

1135
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:54,760
to zero. So so proof of of two.

1136
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:03,880
So we have that this so we're assuming

1137
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,880
that this in here

1138
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,680
this converge

1139
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,200
to some C here which is now bigger than

1140
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,920
one.

1141
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:17,480
So this means that there exist So this

1142
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,480
means that there exist

1143
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,319
capital n such that

1144
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:29,680
if little n is bigger than this capital

1145
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:31,359
n. Sorry. Right. So so we have this in

1146
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,839
here

1147
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:36,880
and what I should before I do this I

1148
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:42,760
should choose my just like before I

1149
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,760
should choose my C zero. So choose

1150
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,799
C 0 such that

1151
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,799
C 0 is bigger than one strictly bigger

1152
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,680
than one but yet is strictly smaller

1153
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:58,680
than C. Right?

1154
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,559
So you choose this and now using this we

1155
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,039
have because we have that this limit

1156
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,799
here converts to C. So it converts to

1157
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:13,799
something that is strictly above this

1158
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:13,799
C0. This means that there exist

1159
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:25,359
capital n such that if little n is

1160
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:28,880
bigger than capital n then uh then this

1161
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:38,319
the nth root

1162
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:40,880
here is um is is bigger than c. Right?

1163
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:44,799
But now again taking the n power on both

1164
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:48,240
sides then you have that a n

1165
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:53,440
to a n is bigger than strictly bigger

1166
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:57,440
than in fact c 0 to the n power.

1167
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:59,680
But you see these guys here right c 0 is

1168
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,160
strictly bigger than one. So this this

1169
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:05,119
here actually even goes to infinity

1170
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:08,119
right. So this does not go to zero.

1171
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,119
Okay.

1172
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,039
So this pro prove again that it's

1173
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,839
divergent.

1174
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:20,079
So this proof two.

1175
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:25,079
Okay. Now the next thing the next thing

1176
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,079
I want to talk about is power series.

1177
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:38,400
So power is

1178
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,480
so remember that so the first example of

1179
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,119
a power series

1180
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:47,680
is something we already looked at more

1181
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:51,039
or less. So suppose you take suppose

1182
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:54,960
that you've looking at the series some

1183
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:59,359
number I call it x now instead of c to

1184
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:02,680
the power n and n= to zero to infinity

1185
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,680
right. Yep.

1186
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:14,160
So, so what we proved so in the root

1187
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:17,720
test here we proved that the series is

1188
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,720
absolutely convergent

1189
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:25,440
convert here we proved it's divergent

1190
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:30,799
and what we actually proved we proved

1191
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:33,120
that a in fact this here a in

1192
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:37,120
that Yeah,

1193
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:40,719
allow me to write that goes to infinity

1194
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:44,080
like this that they they were supposed

1195
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:47,120
to go to zero but we actually right if

1196
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:49,839
it's if the series was converging the

1197
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:53,199
most elementary thing is the most basic

1198
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:55,600
thing is that the a has to go to zero

1199
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:58,560
otherwise it's not going to converge but

1200
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,799
in fact not only do they not go to zero

1201
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,440
they actually in absolute value goes to

1202
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,279
infinity So it's it's very very far from

1203
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:08,279
being convergent,

1204
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,279
right?

1205
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,880
Okay. So now uh so suppose so we looked

1206
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:19,199
at the geometric series, right? If you

1207
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,279
think about x is just representing any

1208
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:25,199
number, you can look at this series

1209
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,920
here. This is the geometric series

1210
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:31,880
and we know that it's convergent. So we

1211
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,880
know that this here is convergent.

1212
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:39,759
It's convergent if if the absolute value

1213
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:43,600
of height is less than one and in that

1214
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:45,920
case this here is sum here is just this

1215
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:50,600
familiar function

1216
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,600
but in general so in general

1217
01:09:52,880 --> 01:10:03,080
you may have a sequence so a if if a

1218
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:03,080
general if a is a sequence

1219
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:12,000
then you can form a power series and the

1220
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:15,120
power series is is like that where this

1221
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,760
is the coefficient the a is now the

1222
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:22,960
coefficient to the x to the power n

1223
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:26,320
right so this is if you will this is

1224
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:29,280
sort of like a infinite polinomial a

1225
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:33,440
polomium of interderee right because the

1226
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,360
sum of all these polomials, right? Okay.

1227
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:40,840
And this is called a power s. So this is

1228
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,840
a power s. This is a power s.

1229
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,960
And the question is then

1230
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:51,679
the question which turned out to be

1231
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:55,040
quite subtle is um so a lot of the basic

1232
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:59,520
functions can be represented by power

1233
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:03,440
series. This here was one example.

1234
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:05,600
Another example is um is so another

1235
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,520
example of if you're looking at the

1236
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,760
exponential function and we'll come back

1237
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,239
and discuss this more but the

1238
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,480
exponential function has a nice power

1239
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:17,920
series representation

1240
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:20,400
and this is the exponential function the

1241
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,800
power series representation of the

1242
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:28,719
exponential function

1243
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:30,480
and also the s and cosine. So cosine x

1244
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,960
this also have a power series

1245
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:38,239
representation

1246
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:42,800
and the power series is -1 to ^ n x ^ 2n

1247
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:46,960
divided by 2 n factorial where you're

1248
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:50,239
summing from 0 to infinity

1249
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:54,640
and sign have a similar one.

1250
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:57,600
So sine uh x has a similar one where

1251
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,440
summing from zero to infinity and then

1252
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:08,480
it's -1

1253
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:13,760
^ n x ^ 2 n + 1 / 2 n + one factorial

1254
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:16,960
right and so and lots of functions has

1255
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,080
um power series representation

1256
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:24,159
but it's not every function. If I write

1257
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:25,920
down a function uh then so in fact I

1258
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:28,640
it's easy to write down a function that

1259
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,960
doesn't have so if you have but I'm not

1260
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,920
going to prove to you that it doesn't so

1261
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,880
if I take the function that starts off

1262
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:40,159
being dead zero and now it's it's it's

1263
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,320
it's becoming interesting so this

1264
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:44,320
function here this one does not have a

1265
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,760
power shares even locally does not have

1266
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:52,159
a power shares okay and the thing is

1267
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:54,080
that that uh power series is an example

1268
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:56,719
of something that's called analytic

1269
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,960
function and this here is not an

1270
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,800
analytic function. So that's why I know

1271
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:05,000
that it definitely doesn't have a power

1272
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,000
series. But anyway, so

1273
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:11,280
um okay. So now

1274
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,159
uh

1275
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:16,480
right so so the question is that if you

1276
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:21,600
take a power series

1277
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:24,080
so suppose you take a sequence a n

1278
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,640
and you write it down. Suppose you take

1279
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:30,080
a sequence a n

1280
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,640
and then you write down a power series

1281
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,560
based on it.

1282
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,280
Then the first question that comes to

1283
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,239
mind is

1284
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:45,880
when does this for which x does this

1285
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:45,880
series converge? Right? So for which x

1286
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,560
does the series converge?

1287
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:06,840
So this is like the most basic thing

1288
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:06,840
and uh let's look at some example.

1289
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,320
Of course if you

1290
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:26,719
if you look at uh so the first example

1291
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:29,040
let me just that is what we already

1292
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:31,440
talked about suppose I'm looking at this

1293
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:34,239
thing here

1294
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:36,480
well this here is you know x if you

1295
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:39,920
think about x's being fixed this is a

1296
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:48,840
geometric series and we already know so

1297
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:48,840
this is for each x for each fixed X.

1298
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,600
This is the geometric series.

1299
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:05,400
So we already know that this thing here

1300
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:05,400
converge. So converge

1301
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:12,719
for as long as the absolute value sign

1302
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:16,920
absolute of x is less than one and we

1303
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,920
also know that it and diverge

1304
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,239
otherwise

1305
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,880
because we've already determined that

1306
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:26,400
right

1307
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,320
okay

1308
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:33,360
uh now you see uh like the next example

1309
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:35,679
I want to look at is the one power

1310
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:38,000
series that represents

1311
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:40,719
the and but we haven't proven that yet

1312
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,120
but we'll see talk about that next time

1313
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:46,719
is the exponential function. If I'm

1314
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,800
looking at this power series here, then

1315
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:54,320
I have

1316
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:57,320
then I I'm interested in for what x

1317
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,320
for

1318
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:04,199
what x

1319
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,199
does this converge?

1320
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:14,320
And so it's natural here to try to apply

1321
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,960
one of the tests. So you just think

1322
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:20,000
about X as being fixed and you just

1323
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,400
apply one of the tests. And the natural

1324
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,199
one is either the root test or the ratio

1325
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:30,480
test. Let's do the ratio test.

1326
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:33,120
So X is fixed and I'm not interested in

1327
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:36,719
X equal to zero. I'm assuming that x is

1328
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:40,560
not equal z because when x is zero right

1329
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:44,560
this here is just right it's only for x

1330
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:47,840
to the power zero is by definition one

1331
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:50,800
uh and all the other things

1332
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:53,280
uh all the other terms are zero right so

1333
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,400
this here is it's definitely convergent

1334
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,480
when x is equal to zero right so let's

1335
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,080
not look at that

1336
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,920
and then because if you don't look at

1337
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:06,880
that you can look at you can think about

1338
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:11,360
a n you can now think about sorry as the

1339
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:14,800
as the series where bn is x to the power

1340
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:17,360
n over n factorial.

1341
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:20,640
If you think about this thing here and

1342
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:23,520
you think about the series as BN, then

1343
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:28,640
the ratio test tells you that if you're

1344
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:31,960
looking at the ratio of BN + one

1345
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,960
over BN.

1346
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:43,120
So if you're looking at BN + 1 over BN,

1347
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,719
take the absolute value of this here.

1348
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:52,800
Well, this is just x

1349
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:55,840
to the^ n + 1 over n + 1 factorial. And

1350
01:17:52,800 --> 01:18:00,000
then you have to divide it

1351
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:03,280
by x ^ n / n factorial.

1352
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,080
Right? If you do that, this here why it

1353
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:12,400
turns up, flips upside down, and you're

1354
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:15,600
getting x to ^ n + 1 uh * n factorial.

1355
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:19,199
And then you're getting x to the n * n +

1356
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:21,280
one factorial. So this is what it's

1357
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:25,600
equal to.

1358
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:29,360
And now of course here there are x *

1359
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:32,159
itself n + one times the n of those is

1360
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:34,960
canceling out with this. Right? So this

1361
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:38,880
is x

1362
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:44,800
and here you have you see here the n +

1363
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:48,400
one factorial. You can write as n +1 and

1364
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,960
then times n * n minus one etc. But

1365
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:53,679
that's just n factorial. So you can

1366
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:57,840
write like that. And so you see that

1367
01:18:53,679 --> 01:19:02,000
this here cancel that. So you left with

1368
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:06,080
n + one. Remember x is fixed. If x is

1369
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,400
fixed as n goes to infinity this here

1370
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:12,000
for each fixed x this here just goes to

1371
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:16,080
zero. So this so now you have from the

1372
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,199
ratio test if that limit if it has a

1373
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:21,920
limit it does have a limit if that limit

1374
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:24,800
is strictly less than one but it's

1375
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,880
actually zero right so it's it's

1376
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:30,159
definitely fall into under one so it's

1377
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:33,920
convergent right so the ratio test tells

1378
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:36,920
you so by the ratio test so by the ratio

1379
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,920
test

1380
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:42,040
this is converted.

1381
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,840
Okay.

1382
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,719
And so we finish here. There's a little

1383
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:56,400
bit more posted already that my lecture

1384
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:59,040
notes. There's a little bit more uh and

1385
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:01,360
I'll probably talk about that uh next

1386
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:03,760
time. I'll just start with just talking

1387
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:07,199
about the stuff I didn't get to. stuff I

1388
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:11,840
didn't get to was and we we touched upon

1389
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:15,679
that earlier is lem soup and lem mint h

1390
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:20,000
and um and the reason why we're covering

1391
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:22,480
it here is that what if the ratio what

1392
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,360
if these things what if the nth root so

1393
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,840
you're asking for either the ratio or

1394
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,159
the nth root of something to have a

1395
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,960
limit but what if it doesn't have a

1396
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:35,520
limit right and so it's dealing with

1397
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,520
that case. Okay.

1398
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,239
All right. Any questions?

1399
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,159
>> That means for all X, right?

1400
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:45,280
>> This is for all X, but think about X as

1401
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:47,199
being fixed, right? Think about X, you

1402
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,600
know, you're just for you're just asking

1403
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:52,239
for one particular X, but it holds for

1404
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,199
all X, but but don't think about X also

1405
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:57,440
as being variable, right? Because X, you

1406
01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:00,320
think about X as being fixed, and then

1407
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,719
you let N go to infinity,

1408
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:05,600
>> right? And then Yeah. Yeah, that's

1409
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:08,320
right. And so you have for all X this

1410
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,920
makes sense. And then you can ask how

1411
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:13,239
does it vary in X? But that's a

1412
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,239
different story.
