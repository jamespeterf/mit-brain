1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,680
Right. Good morning everybody. Uh,

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,000
welcome to a very special MPG primer

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,320
doing something different today where we

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,559
have a career panel and I'm going to

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,599
hand it off to Pam to get things kicked

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,759
off. Thank you.

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,279
>> Thank you, Michelle. Okay, great. So,

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
um, thank you all for coming in person

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,480
and online and it's really my pleasure

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,880
to um, introduce this panel of um,

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,760
esteemed scientists. Um I know each of

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,599
them through different channels and um I

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,679
will let them introduce themselves but I

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,079
just wanted to thank them for coming and

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,920
sharing your journeys. Um I think what

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,760
the first thing we wanted to do is have

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
each of you spend a few minutes just

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,719
introduce yourself tell us a little bit

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
about your journey and um where you

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
started and where you are now and then

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,640
we can take it from there. Thanks. Go

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,640
ahead Joanne.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,079
Yeah. All right. Great. Yeah. Such a

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,680
pleasure to be back here. Uh I think for

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
many of us who spend time at the Broad

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
and it's always fun to walk back in the

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
doors again and uh uh so great to get a

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,080
chance to to meet all of you and talk.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,479
For me, I started out uh probably like

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,200
many of you with a PhD in science. I

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,759
studied uh biochemistry at Berkeley and

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
then did a posttock actually two postocs

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,799
one in a children's hospital in Paris

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,600
and then one at Janentech. Uh after that

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,200
I was uh stepping back uh as many of you

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,119
may do and thinking about what to do

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
with the research background that I had.

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,040
I knew that I really loved science and I

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
really loved research but I didn't

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
necessarily really like doing research

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
myself. Uh and so with that I was

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,159
looking for ways to be involved in uh

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
you know kind of the forefront of

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,799
science and especially my interest has

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
always been in uh drug discovery uh and

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,560
looking for different ways to do that.

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
And so I went first uh to Nature

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
Publishing Group where I got the chance

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
to work with Pam and with Kyle um uh to

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
start up a journal called uh that was

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
new at the time called Nature Chemical

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,719
Biology. And so I spent a bunch of time

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,799
there getting to know the chemical

54
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,560
biology community, early stage drug

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,160
discovery, uh, and from there uh, met,

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
uh, people at the Broad and got the

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
chance to move here and and work here on

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,599
a bunch of different projects that were

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
all connected to either discovering and

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
validating targets uh, for drug

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720
discovery or early stage drug discovery

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,520
uh, with small molecule tool compounds

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,760
uh, small molecule discovery.

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
I found from working here that I really

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,920
loved the science. I really loved the

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,160
early stages of drug discovery, but I

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,560
wanted to really be a part of then

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,680
taking that drug discovery forward and

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,760
and into the clinic and wanted to do

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
that on the business side rather than on

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,680
the science side. And so I went from

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,280
there to F-Prime Capital where I worked

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,440
within a early stage venture investor

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,000
uh and got to see how they thought about

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,720
science that was investable uh and how

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,440
to progress uh companies and from there

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,519
got the chance to co-found with two uh

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,159
two faculty from the broad Stuart

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,239
Shriber and Robnik Savior uh about eight

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,400
years ago or so now a company called

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,800
Janana uh where we had a small molecule

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
discovery platform uh took that company

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
through to into the clinic and proof

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,480
concept. Uh it got bought uh by a

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,440
Japanese pharmaceutical company last

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,760
year and now have jumped into a another

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,120
startup company uh with technology out

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,959
of UMass Medical uh team working on RNAI

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
approaches for neurological diseases.

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,799
And so uh with that I'll I'll pass over

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
but just to give you a sense of all the

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,840
many different kinds of places I was

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,200
able to to go and work uh with a with a

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,440
PhD in science.

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,959
>> Hi everyone. Uh my name is Laura Stppel.

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm a partner at a healthcare based or a

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,159
healthc care specific investment firm

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,879
based in Boston called RI Capital

99
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,599
Management. Um I started out my career

100
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,360
also doing a PhD at MIT actually. I was

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,280
over at the pick pickower institute

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920
across the street actually not at Brody

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
but collaborated with um Ed Skolnick was

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,599
was at the Broad at the time. Um

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,360
collaborated with his group and and the

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,360
medicinal chemistry unit doing some drug

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,760
validation and pre-clinical mouse

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,160
models. um kind of always knew that I

109
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,840
didn't want to be in academia, but

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,919
didn't exactly know where I would go.

111
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,560
Kind of assumed I would go into biotech,

112
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,320
more in a a research role. Towards the

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
end of my PhD, developed a pretty

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,720
debilitating mouse allergy. Um and mouse

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,720
was my model system. So, kind of a oh no

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,320
moment um of what am I going to do with

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,080
my life? So the the BCS U brain and

118
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
cognitive brain and cognitive science

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,880
graduate program is actually really

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,759
supportive and entrepreneurial and um

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,400
gave the grad students a ton of money to

122
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,840
organize a career fair. Um turns out

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
it's really hard to organize a career

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,759
fair. I thought like companies would be

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,240
piling in to come meet with us grad

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,240
students. Not the case. Um, so it was

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,400
definitely a heavy lift and at the time

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
I was just chatting with a friend and

129
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
and colleague from material science or

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
former grad student at the time who

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
worked at RA Capital and he was like,

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
"Well, why why doesn't RA Capital come?

133
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
How about finance?" And I was like, "I

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,199
don't think anyone's going to be

135
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,120
interested in finance, but thank you."

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,800
Um, but desperation got the best of me

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
and and invited them in and actually

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
learned a lot more about this world of

139
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,759
healthcare investing through that

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,000
process. um ended up, you know, really

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,080
resonating with um kind of this idea

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,919
that I could use my scientific training

143
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,919
to look at companies developing really

144
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,400
cool different types of of science and

145
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
drugs and modalities. Ended up joining

146
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,160
as an associate on what's called the the

147
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
Tech Atlas team. So, it's kind of our

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,039
internal think tank uh research engine

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
made up of largely PhDs and MDs that

150
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,080
work alongside the investment team to

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,479
diligence all the investable

152
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,960
opportunities that come our way. um and

153
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,720
ended up really loving investing um and

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
stepping onto the investment team a

155
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,280
number of years later. Um so RE Capital

156
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,600
is a multi-stage investment firm. What

157
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,400
that means is we do everything from

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,759
venture capital, new company formation,

159
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,919
similar to what you would think of like

160
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,840
the flagships and and arches and third

161
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,000
rocks of the world. Um and we do

162
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,319
everything from that to public market

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,919
investing including now as some of our

164
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,400
portfolio companies have matured

165
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,039
commercial stage uh companies. So it

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,199
kind of spans the entire gamut of of

167
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,000
company life cycle. Um and uh yeah as a

168
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,080
part of that I have an opportunity to um

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,319
not only you know look at and invest in

170
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,560
really cool companies but also join the

171
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
board of companies and really help shape

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,080
you know the the direction of the

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,199
company. Actually R Capital was an

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,199
investor of Janana um Joann's company

175
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,880
and we were really excited um you know

176
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,560
to support that company through through

177
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,039
to the end. Um, so yeah, that's the how

178
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I got to where I am.

179
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:56,080
>> Um, hi everyone. I'm Serena Silver. Um,

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,880
I um actually know Pam from our time at

181
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,560
NYU in the same uh fly lab and uh

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,800
applying to PhD programs basically

183
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,319
around the same time. Um I did my PhD

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,560
right next door at the Whitehead. um and

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,280
uh then I did a posttock uh at Harvard

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,360
Medical School both in uh Drosophila

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,680
labs which is not your typical path to

188
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,759
industry. So um you know but I think

189
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,560
that the basis of genetics was really

190
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,479
key uh in my transitions while I was a

191
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
posttock I realized that you know I had

192
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,400
kind of been on that academic uh career

193
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,440
path and realized that wasn't the path

194
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,360
for me um and so started to look around

195
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,160
and understand how I could make that

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
transition. Um I was this was a long

197
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,199
time ago. So um it was the dawn of RNAI

198
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,639
and actually the dawn just just before

199
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,919
we started to be able to do RNAI and

200
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,520
mamalian cells at scale. And so I came

201
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,599
to the broad in 2006 um to lead the

202
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,360
first screening projects, RNAI screening

203
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,800
projects. Crisper didn't exist. I know

204
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
that might be hard for some of you to

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
believe, but um there were zinc fingers

206
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,960
which were really tedious and then uh

207
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,199
RNAI which was super exciting at the

208
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,280
time. And so took the experience I had

209
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,199
with RNAI screens in Drosophila cells

210
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
and brought them over to work in human

211
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,039
and mouse projects uh in what was then

212
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,639
the RNI platform now the GPP and uh

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,960
spent five years um building screens uh

214
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,120
collaborating with folks all over MIT

215
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,199
and Harvard and beyond um and then um

216
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,919
made a transition to industry. So I was

217
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,400
recruited to Santa Fe um so big pharma

218
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,199
experience uh there I was in the target

219
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,839
discovery uh group um ultimately led

220
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,560
that group and then uh moved over to

221
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,080
Noardis um to lead the molecular

222
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,080
pharmarmacology group which is another

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,320
way of saying cellular assays that

224
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
enable drug discovery. Um so both of

225
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
those were actually in oncology space.

226
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,279
Um my career has kind of gone from that

227
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,440
early discovery all the way now into

228
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,040
clinical. So you know at Santa Fe it was

229
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
really all about target discovery,

230
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,279
target validation. At Novartis it was

231
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,959
around actually now that we have found

232
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
the target and there's still some target

233
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,720
discovery there and actually some big of

234
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
the big crisper screening efforts but

235
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,480
now that we found the target how do we

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,800
develop the best cell assays to actually

237
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,000
find drugs small molecules or biologics

238
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,240
that act that meaningfully biologically

239
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,120
move the the biology the way we we want

240
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,720
it to to actually address disease.

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,320
Um after Novartis I I loved what we

242
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
could do there. I mean the amazing

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
capabilities at a place like that. Um

244
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,320
but you know there's also a lot of

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,560
process in a big in a big organization.

246
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
And so I was excited by the idea of

247
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,760
going to a smaller company where I could

248
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,240
have more day-to-day impact on strategy

249
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,959
and really be part of driving uh the

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
company forward. And I joined a biotech

251
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,240
called Fulcrum Therapeutics which is a

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,160
rare disease company. It was in some

253
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,760
ways kind of going back to my Drosophila

254
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,240
genetics days and developmental biology

255
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,120
days of how could we actually address uh

256
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,680
these genetic uh diseases especially uh

257
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,560
cickle cell disease um and uh

258
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,640
musculardrophies like FSHD.

259
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,880
Um while I was there uh we uh brought um

260
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
a small molecule to the clinic for cle

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,480
cell disease which is actually just had

262
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,160
a a really exciting readout at Ash this

263
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,240
week. Um a few years ago I really wanted

264
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,079
to go back uh to oncology um just driven

265
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,560
by you know I think many of us have a

266
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,000
lot of personal connections to oncology

267
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,399
um and really wanted to move back to

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,399
that space and so I joined Accent

269
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,040
therapeutics um first as vice president

270
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,040
of biology and now uh at this beginning

271
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,839
of of this year uh became the chief

272
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,839
scientific officer. So, Axen is a small

273
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,440
molecule oncology company looking for

274
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,399
precision oncology uh targets uh that

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,320
can really address uh very selected

276
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,120
populations based on genetics or cell

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,279
state uh in oncology and we have two

278
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
programs uh in the clinic became a

279
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,640
clinical company about a year ago. So,

280
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
it's been really exciting to kind of go

281
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
from those early target discovery

282
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,160
efforts uh now to actually you know

283
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
working with investigators and

284
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,399
clinicians to to bring these molecules

285
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,320
to patients. Um,

286
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,920
and uh, yeah. So, and I I was at the

287
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,920
Broad from 2006 to 2011. So, before this

288
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,920
whole like extra building was was

289
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,680
happening, I've actually parked like I

290
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,279
my parking spot used to be on so many

291
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
places that there's now a gigantic

292
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,079
building. It's really disconcerting to

293
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,079
drive through Cambridge.

294
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,600
>> So, I'm Kyle Vogen. I'm an editor with

295
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,800
Nature Genetics here based here in

296
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Boston. Um my path uh into science

297
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,079
started in Montreal where I uh grew up

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,279
and went to McGill University and in the

299
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,160
course of my undergrad there got

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,320
interested in you know academic research

301
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,839
um especially in my senior year in the

302
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
honors project. So I was enjoying

303
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,680
enjoying what I was doing. I ended up

304
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,760
staying at McGill for my PhD in the same

305
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,480
lab that I had done my um undergrad

306
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,720
honors project in and um really loved

307
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,959
you know the process of doing science.

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,760
certainly was on a traditional academic

309
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,800
uh track. Um about halfway through my

310
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,240
PhD, I remember seeing a a job ad for an

311
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,760
editorial position at Cell and thought

312
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,519
to myself, hm, that looks interesting.

313
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,760
But of course, at that moment, I was

314
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
busy doing my, you know, PhD and and

315
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,480
fully committed to sort of the academic

316
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:16,720
uh career uh path. And um I

317
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
it was in a biochemistry department, but

318
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
doing mouse genetics and ironically, I

319
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,480
also developed a mouse allergy. Um, I

320
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,839
don't know if that would have stopped me

321
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,120
from working in a mouse lab, but as it

322
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,040
happened, I I was very interested in

323
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,200
developmental biology. And the lab that

324
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
ended up being drawn to is a lab that

325
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,519
worked primarily using uh the chick

326
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,200
model. Um, so at Harvard Medical School,

327
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,760
medical school with uh Cliff Davin. So I

328
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,600
came down um to Boston for my postoc and

329
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,360
uh was enjoying you know that process

330
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,079
and again thought I was on a traditional

331
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,600
you know academic path but um discovered

332
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,639
as I as I went through it that there

333
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
were certain things that came naturally

334
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,600
to me other things that came less

335
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
naturally to me and I noticed one thing

336
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,959
that other people seem to have which

337
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,959
which I lacked was this determination to

338
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,200
work through problems at the bench. Um,

339
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,760
and so I could, you know, uh, I could

340
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,360
always find energy to to read, write,

341
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,720
talk about science, and I enjoyed doing

342
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,079
experiments and loved when they worked,

343
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,320
but they didn't work. I didn't

344
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,320
necessarily have the same whatever grit

345
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
that I saw other people had. So, at some

346
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,600
point, I had to decide, okay, am I going

347
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,880
to make this academic career work? Um, I

348
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,800
thought I could if I really wanted it,

349
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
but I wasn't sure anymore that I did.

350
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,600
And I wondered what what else could I

351
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,639
do? and and that editing had always been

352
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,360
in the back of my mind because it was

353
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,560
something that came naturally to me in

354
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,600
terms of, you know, I had a lot of

355
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,200
opportunities to um to write, you know,

356
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
review type things. I always was kind of

357
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,079
the person that people would go to when

358
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,720
they had their manuscript and they

359
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,279
wanted some feedback on on it. So, um

360
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,600
so, but short short of it was I finally

361
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,680
decided, okay, I'm ready to make that um

362
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,839
you know, jump in that direction and

363
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,440
Naturics happened to be um a journal

364
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,360
that was hiring. So, I applied,

365
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
interviewed, got the job, and that was

366
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,160
in 2003, and I've stayed with the

367
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,760
journal um through since then, initially

368
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,800
working in New York City, but I

369
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,760
relocated back to Boston. Um, and that I

370
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,079
will add that that's a little bit um not

371
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,920
typical. Um, most editors who go into

372
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,279
it, some some like me do stay in it for

373
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,720
the long haul, other people do it for a

374
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,760
season, move on to something else like

375
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,880
Joan or or Pam. Um, so um so it

376
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,519
definitely can be a full career. or it

377
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,079
can also be a step along a career

378
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,079
towards something else.

379
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,440
>> So much. Um I think we'll ask one

380
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,079
question and then we'll open it up to

381
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,639
everybody. Um we're wondering what

382
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:37,839
skills do you use most often in your

383
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:40,639
role that you didn't expect to rely on?

384
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,120
Thoughts?

385
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:48,000
Uh I guess for me the

386
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,040
the part of my role that I like the best

387
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,720
is the part that's science as a

388
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,279
foundation but it's really connecting

389
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,240
with people and team and finding the

390
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,560
right set of people that have the right

391
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
um you know technical and scientific

392
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,040
capabilities but the right passion for

393
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,560
solving the same problem. And so it's

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,519
the

395
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,279
uh really the the people in team part of

396
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,079
it that in my mind makes the difference

397
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,320
between uh things really really tough

398
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
problems being able to succeed but also

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,600
it being fun along the way whether you

400
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,839
succeed or not. Sometimes the science

401
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,560
doesn't work. Uh and so I would say the

402
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,720
the people part of it is the part that

403
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,480
um the science is the foundation but

404
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,480
that's what I really love to be able to

405
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,880
to build on to do.

406
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,839
I don't know that this isn't surprising.

407
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,560
Um data analytics for sure. I mean you

408
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,320
know certainly analyzing my own data as

409
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,160
a PhD student like you're the

410
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,240
expectation is that you'll do that but

411
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
just developing the skill set to analyze

412
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
literally any data set that comes your

413
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,720
way. Um, and you know, I was very

414
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
focused on pre-clinical data when I was

415
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,959
doing my PhD, but now I spend so much

416
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
time analyzing clinical data and, you

417
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,880
know, it's a lot of the same, you know,

418
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,639
kind of what you need to pay attention

419
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,519
to, you know, picking up on small

420
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,120
nuances and differences and um, so

421
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,279
certainly like a strong foundation in

422
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,959
data analytics. And the other thing is

423
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,040
just having, you know, the kind of

424
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,399
executive presence to go into a room

425
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,320
meeting with management teams of

426
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,759
companies. Um, you know, and and

427
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,279
certainly that was very intimidating for

428
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
me initially coming straight out of my

429
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,360
PhD and they're putting me in, you know,

430
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
the room with the CEO and the the CMO of

431
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
this company and and I'm leading that

432
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,880
meeting. Um, but certainly like lab

433
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,320
meeting presentations and just the back

434
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,160
and forth and dialogue that happens

435
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,399
there, the ability to ask critical

436
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,800
questions in, you know, a productive

437
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,959
way. Um, those are definitely like soft

438
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,279
skills that I picked up during my PhD

439
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,199
that I use a lot of at RA.

440
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,519
Yeah, I would I would definitely echo,

441
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,079
you know, the team social emotional

442
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,720
dynamics uh and the the data analytics.

443
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,360
I would actually also say, you know,

444
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,120
first principles, you know, that sort of

445
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,680
foundation of like being able to

446
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,680
understand why something isn't working

447
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,160
or pick up on things to ask those

448
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,559
questions. Um, it's really, you know,

449
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,880
you you being be because I'm not in the

450
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,559
lab, I'm also like removed enough that I

451
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
can sort of sometimes kind of pick up on

452
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,280
those and I'm always pleasantly

453
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
surprised where I feel like I've

454
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,480
actually still added value even though

455
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,079
I'm not in the lab anymore with a qu,

456
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,319
you know, with a a question around

457
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,480
experimental design or troubleshooting.

458
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,240
Um, I think the other thing I I just

459
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,280
want to echo from what Laura said is

460
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:35,200
that the presentation skills are so

461
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,240
hugely important. And in my PhD, my PhD

462
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,280
adviser, like she was so amazing about

463
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,280
making us all do practice talks. You you

464
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,559
you'd give a practice talk and the you'd

465
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,880
go through it all and then the lab would

466
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,320
give you feedback and nitpick on every

467
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,160
single slide. And that was the best

468
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,440
training for everything I do today. Like

469
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,000
communicating your science clearly and

470
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,960
the message and the storytelling the

471
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
more you practice that you know even in

472
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,440
my postto there were some posttos when

473
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
they were going their job interviews

474
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
like they just went on their own. They

475
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
were like I I know what I'm I can give

476
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
my job talk. I know my sites and I'm

477
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,720
sure and many of them got great jobs but

478
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,679
there were others who actively sought

479
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,520
feedback along the way and just practice

480
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,080
that because it's going to be the most

481
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,160
valuable thing that you can do and just

482
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,280
you know having no ego about your slides

483
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
about what you put together and just

484
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,000
saying like help me make this better

485
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,280
like I had a office mate at Novartis who

486
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,080
actually remember in my interview like

487
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
she was actually the most intimidating

488
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,559
person who interviewed me right and I

489
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,919
was like oh I have to turn off this

490
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,520
person Right? And we became obviously we

491
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,799
became great friends but she was also

492
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
the person like if I was going to

493
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,000
present something if I showed her that

494
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,320
slide like she would be like what's that

495
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,120
point there right? So she was actually

496
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,280
like the best person to go to because

497
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,440
she would actually pay attention. So

498
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,200
both developing that skill set to pay

499
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,000
attention to those details in your own

500
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,679
data for your for your peers and when

501
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,080
you find that those people who actually

502
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
can give you that constructive um

503
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,160
criticism and feedback like cultivate

504
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,480
that relationship, keep asking for that

505
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,000
feedback, get really used to that um

506
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,520
because it actually will make all your

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,640
science better and all your

508
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,720
communication better.

509
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,200
Um for me the thing that stands out is

510
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,960
the need to be a lifetime learner and um

511
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,480
especially

512
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,840
obviously science is always you know

513
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,760
moving forward and even in you know a

514
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,240
particular subject area there's always

515
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,360
new things to be learning but um I'm

516
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,120
amazed at how much I have to draw on all

517
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,880
of the different things I've learned

518
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
over the years even you know at a

519
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
genetics journal sure we're publishing

520
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,400
genetics but we need to know

521
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,799
biochemistry or molecular biology or

522
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,880
cell biology or physiology or anatomy,

523
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,320
um, developmental biology. And so,

524
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,320
again, just having that ability to,

525
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,240
you know, absorb and then draw on all

526
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,679
that that broad knowledge base to be

527
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,480
able to kind of appreciate, you know,

528
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,600
manuscripts that are spanning across a

529
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,559
really broad spectrum of, um, science.

530
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,480
So, yeah.

531
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,600
Um, I thought we'd open it up for

532
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:23,160
questions. Anyone have anything? Go for

533
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,160
it. If not, I can keep asking, but

534
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,039
>> um, yeah, thank you so much for coming.

535
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,159
It's so cool to have like such a large

536
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:33,919
variety of the non-academia,

537
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,640
uh, represented here. Um, but it's still

538
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,320
sounds like you all had a academic

539
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,720
background and you all did a PhD. Um and

540
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,880
I know that multiple people in this room

541
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,520
including myself don't have a PhD but

542
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,320
work as staff scientists definitely on a

543
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,240
posttock level and have the experience.

544
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,440
Um now you hear often that oh it's

545
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,480
getting less and less important in

546
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,799
industry but often times when you see

547
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,440
job postings it's always still like a

548
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,760
hard requirement. Um do you have any

549
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,799
advice for people like me um when you

550
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,480
are approached or get applications by

551
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,520
people who don't have that formal

552
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,200
requirement? Um yeah any advice or how

553
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,200
you see that how you would approach

554
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
that?

555
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:27,120
>> Sorry. um you know so we don't require a

556
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:29,200
PhD or or MD um to join kind of our our

557
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,640
I guess research group the tech atlas

558
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,799
group that would kind of lead up into

559
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,799
the investment team um most of the

560
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,320
people do have a PhD or MD but there are

561
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,760
certainly some folks and some folks who

562
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,280
have actually stepped onto the

563
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
investment team actually one of our

564
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,760
managing partner founders you know

565
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,919
doesn't have a PhD it's really about

566
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,280
demonstrating the ability to you know

567
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,679
kind of analyze data at that level. Um,

568
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
and at RA we do have kind of a in the

569
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,840
application process, there's an

570
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,280
assignment as part of it. It's um, not

571
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
not really a case study like you would

572
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,520
do with consulting, but sort of similar.

573
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,039
Um, so there's an opportunity to prove

574
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,919
that out. So, you know, I think

575
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,039
developing a strong network and, you

576
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,799
know, kind of getting your foot in the

577
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,159
door to then be able to prove that like,

578
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,640
hey, you know, I actually have the same

579
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,480
skill set that everyone who um, you

580
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,960
know, was was silly enough to sit

581
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,840
through five plus years of of a PhD and

582
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,760
and posttock. Um, but yeah, I I would

583
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,440
say don't let it hold you back. You

584
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,520
know, certainly it just probably takes a

585
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,360
little bit more of kind of that initial

586
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,799
step to to get, you know, the folks

587
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
attention to to give you the

588
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,760
opportunity. But certainly there have

589
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,039
been a lot of really really impressive

590
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,200
colleagues that I've worked with who do

591
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,840
not have PhDs.

592
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,960
>> Yeah, I would say um a couple things on

593
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,760
on that like certainly um I've had

594
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,720
people in my teams at Novartis uh in

595
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,880
folkram at Accent who you know have had

596
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,960
and at Santa B across the gamut who've

597
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,679
had what we would consider like PhD

598
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,320
level roles, lab head type of roles

599
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,000
without a PhD. they generally had more

600
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,840
time in you know sort of equivalent

601
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,919
amounts of time in terms of experience

602
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,480
and building up that experience and and

603
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,320
knowledge. What I would say in terms of

604
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,799
critical things to be able to make that

605
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,520
jump. If you think about what someone's

606
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,360
being asked for in a job application or

607
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,159
in you know if they're coming from a PhD

608
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,679
or postoc they have a story a scientific

609
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,520
story to tell in terms of what they've

610
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,440
done as an independent strategy thinking

611
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,320
through the next steps planning those

612
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,080
next steps 100% many people without P

613
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,400
you know that's not does not require a

614
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,159
PhD to do that right but I think what

615
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,960
you want to pay a lot of attention to is

616
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,600
how are you telling that story of your

617
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,000
contributions of your skill set and and

618
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,919
sort of demonstrating that for you know

619
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,919
the person on the other side of the page

620
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,360
and you know ideally as as Laura said

621
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,960
you're doing some networking so people

622
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,360
know you as more than just that you know

623
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,480
sheet of paper um but I think those

624
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,520
opportunities to give a talk at at at

625
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,640
you know forums at the broad to um be

626
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,159
part of you know you don't have to be

627
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,360
the first author on the paper but you

628
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
know there should be figures that you

629
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,559
could point to like that this was you

630
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,480
know and you know for most um industry

631
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
kind of lab based jobs. You will be

632
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,840
asked to give a a scientific

633
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,039
presentation for example, right? So, and

634
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,559
you've seen if you're at the you're

635
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,880
here, you've seen lots of beautiful

636
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,080
presentations. Think about what yours

637
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,480
looks like. Start to build that um that

638
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,720
that storyline. And again, it can come

639
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,039
from different parts and and you we all

640
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,640
present data that is is done as a team,

641
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,880
but being able to sort of say these were

642
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
my ideas. This is, you know, what we

643
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,400
what the next step was. a lot of, you

644
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,400
know, a question I ask a lot of people

645
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,039
when interviewing people for like entry

646
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,600
level industry jobs is like what is

647
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,600
coming from academia, right? It doesn't

648
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,919
have to be that what they did is exactly

649
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,279
on target for what we what we want. But

650
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,520
I'm asking for like how are they

651
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,360
thinking, right? So how do what how does

652
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,799
what you did what are the next steps?

653
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,559
What's that enabling in the lab? what's

654
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,320
that getting people excited about and

655
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,400
sort of demonstrating that you're

656
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
thinking like people who you know who

657
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,320
who are asked to think that way as a PhD

658
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,400
not because others don't have cap that

659
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,760
capability but just hopefully that helps

660
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,240
>> I think and the only thing I would add

661
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,080
is all of us here and so many people you

662
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,840
end up working on things that are not

663
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,919
anywhere near the science you did your

664
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,799
PhD in and so um

665
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,799
and it can be that with a PhD you learn

666
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,720
how to think very deeply about exactly

667
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,120
what you're doing, the details, the

668
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,840
nuance, the uh you know, the next

669
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,240
question. But when you go beyond that,

670
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,320
it's it's really more the ability to

671
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,080
step back and see the big picture and

672
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,000
know how to ask the right questions and

673
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,240
know how to put what you hear in context

674
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,080
of a bigger landscape, whether it's a

675
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,360
bigger science landscape or a business

676
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,520
landscape. and and so I think there's

677
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,840
although a lot of people do have PhDs

678
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,279
and MDs in the end it's when you have

679
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,240
conversations with people there's

680
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,919
equally um

681
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,039
you know no requirement at all and lots

682
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,039
of people who succeed because of the way

683
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,480
that they think about the context of the

684
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,720
science and the bigger picture and the

685
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,240
impact and I think in a conversation

686
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,559
it's really easy for that to come

687
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,080
through and so to me in the places I've

688
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,159
been as well I don't see uh it's how you

689
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,679
think about and approach how you spend

690
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,960
your time in the questions you ask that

691
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,279
makes the most difference.

692
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,279
>> Thank you all.

693
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,559
>> So

694
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,760
>> hello. Thank you very much for um this

695
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,320
organization.

696
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,799
I um I would like to ask like

697
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,279
considering these repeat evolvement of

698
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,200
technology and science like you example

699
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,320
the there wasn't crisper but there was

700
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,960
at least zinc finger so uh in academia

701
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,919
we are pretty much like subject to adapt

702
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,960
these new developments all time I wonder

703
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,919
how it feels in the other career paths

704
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,159
like uh this uh like I don't know now we

705
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
are speaking of AI and then there was

706
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,720
another stuff so I just wonder how it

707
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,480
feels and how you uh would what kind of

708
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:11,480
suggestions you would give us and uh who

709
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,480
uh try to grow in this uh ecosystem.

710
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,279
>> Yeah, I mean I'll I'll say that on the

711
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
publishing side of things that we're in

712
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,960
I guess it's the same situation for us

713
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,200
as we're watching the field and trying

714
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120
to anticipate you know where the field

715
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,720
is going. So again I've been at the

716
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,120
journal for more than 20 years. So when

717
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,720
I started you know microwaves were just

718
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,360
coming out you know and suddenly there

719
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,679
was wow exo sequencing and whole genome

720
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,120
sequencing and it really I think and

721
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,000
then all the omix technologies that

722
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,080
the technology has really driven the

723
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,919
directions that the fields have gone. So

724
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,840
from our point of view it's recognizing

725
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,600
where the field is heading and getting

726
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,520
getting trying to get ahead of that you

727
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,720
know to to be able to prioritize the

728
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,720
right the right areas. Yeah.

729
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,960
Yeah, when you when you initially asked

730
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,159
your question, right, what immediately

731
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,840
came to my mind was AI. Um, and you

732
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,360
know, it's something that it's such a

733
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,640
broad term and it could apply to so many

734
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,480
different things. It could apply to drug

735
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
development. Um, or it could just apply

736
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,320
to like, you know, productivity and and

737
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,799
the kind of AI tools that you use in

738
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,480
your everyday. I think for for me, you

739
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,480
know, that's really what I've had to

740
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,279
adapt to. I think I was labeled a

741
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,880
dinosaur by my um by my boss. Um you

742
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,720
know, and and I've seen some of the

743
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,559
younger colleagues that I have that come

744
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,399
in and have really like leaned into it

745
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,880
and just the productivity that they've

746
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,799
been able to gain by embracing it. Um

747
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,399
and it's hard to carve out that time to

748
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,679
actually do it. But I definitely think

749
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:46,480
it's worthwhile to, you know, stay up to

750
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,200
date on all of the emerging, you know,

751
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,120
assays, modalities, AI that you can

752
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,919
because there are other people doing it

753
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,679
and that's giving some folks an edge. So

754
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,799
I I think it's worth the investment for

755
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,559
sure.

756
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,679
>> I'll give maybe a little counter to that

757
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,760
which is I think it's it can be so

758
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,840
exciting all the new technologies. I

759
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,000
think the more you can ground it in the

760
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,640
key questions, the more you'll be able

761
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,279
to differentiate. Um, so it's not I, you

762
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,880
know, I think it you get some exposure.

763
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,720
Obviously, you know, if if you're good

764
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,279
at it, if it's exciting to you, lean

765
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,120
into what you're excited about. But, you

766
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,600
know, it can be tempting to sort of feel

767
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,080
like, oh, everyone's doing AI image

768
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,919
analysis or whatever it is, but does

769
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,480
your project need AI image analysis, or

770
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,880
would it really be better served by, you

771
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,240
know, a a different technique, right?

772
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
scanning EM or whatever. I'm making

773
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,399
things up, right? But I think just

774
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,520
really coming back to like the clear

775
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,240
scientific questions and goals and how

776
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,640
the technology can serve those

777
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,520
and not being too worried about like I

778
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,520
have to be doing the latest thing.

779
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,880
>> That's funny. It's at actually at RA

780
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,640
Capital that they have this question

781
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,320
that we got asked when I was at my last

782
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
company all the time which is like oh

783
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,880
sure you have a really cool technology

784
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,600
but like what's the killer actual drug

785
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,919
discovery clinical development app for

786
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
that and and finding that like where

787
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,080
does a new technology connect with

788
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,399
clinical impact and and company value.

789
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,360
And so it's a uh kind of a

790
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,120
multiffactorial uh uh challenge to come

791
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,240
to the right answer to that. But that's

792
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,399
part of what makes uh makes you know uh

793
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,000
biotech and fun actually is trying to

794
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,000
find that intersection.

795
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,120
>> I guess I'll add one more thing too like

796
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,200
this is also an area where flexing those

797
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,679
collaboration and teamwork muscles can

798
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,440
be fantastic right so at my company

799
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,120
we're not an AI company we're like

800
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,840
really you know hardcore biochemist

801
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,600
biologists but I think but we have a

802
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,880
great partnership now with an AI company

803
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,039
that we're working with. We just had a

804
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,200
poster uh at the recent triple meeting

805
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,399
where we had a you know co-authored um

806
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
some work where basically you know some

807
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,200
of our biological findings and how could

808
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,279
we translate that and could we use their

809
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,120
AI model to sort of get some do some

810
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,799
digital pathology type of of

811
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,480
interpretation. So you know I think

812
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,840
these are all different avenues too to

813
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,279
think about well you know here's my

814
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,919
scientific problem is there a really

815
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,080
cool technology lab that you know would

816
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,440
make sense to to collaborate with so I

817
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,240
can learn more from like the people who

818
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,279
are truly in this space and also advance

819
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,279
the project. So

820
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,000
>> guys, um I have a question. So as people

821
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,440
that are considering to go into industry

822
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,279
and not wanting to continue the academic

823
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,960
path, I'm wondering like if we want to

824
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,880
get into industry, I know you guys

825
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,480
mostly went did posttos before going

826
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,640
into industry and I guess you had gone

827
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,240
from grad school to industry. So I'm

828
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,080
wondering now there's a lot of like

829
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,840
fellowships to go into like you know

830
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,159
biotech like posttock positions in

831
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,200
biotech or VC fellowships. So do you

832
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,960
think people wanting to break into

833
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,799
industry need to get these like

834
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,720
fellowships or maybe internships to get

835
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,720
experience in these mark fields or do

836
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,919
you think it's still possible to come in

837
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,960
with like none of this experience

838
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,559
because now it seems like you kind of

839
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,080
have to get experience to get in this

840
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,519
field and kind of seems impossible to

841
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,760
break out you know once you've only been

842
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,760
in academia.

843
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,519
>> I I can definitely speak from the you

844
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,279
know the venture side of things. Um, we

845
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,960
we've certainly hired people that have

846
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,120
been at some of these fellowships, but

847
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,600
the vast majority of hires that we make

848
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,000
did not. Um, you know, I don't think

849
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,240
it's a bad idea to do a fellowship. Um,

850
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,399
you know, especially if the bandwidth uh

851
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,559
to to take that on with everything else

852
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,399
that I'm sure you have going on. Um, but

853
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,159
it's certainly not a requirement. And,

854
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,519
you know, at RA, I think we maybe have a

855
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,679
different mentality than a lot of our

856
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,600
peers and we love to train people

857
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,360
internally. we think kind of a little

858
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,360
bit different sometimes especially being

859
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,799
a multi-stage investment firm like Jan

860
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,919
said we're we're not just looking at

861
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,919
like is that you know modality that

862
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,760
platform is it awesome is it going to be

863
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,760
a game changer but like what are you

864
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,320
applying it to like are you actually

865
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,240
going to develop in a meaningful enough

866
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,279
market opportunity or a met need in

867
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,320
order to attract later stage investors.

868
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,880
Um, so you know, we we typically like to

869
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,120
kind of train people internally. Um, and

870
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,880
and while we've had very successful um,

871
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,799
folks join our team from doing those

872
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,440
fellowships, it is absolutely not

873
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,960
required.

874
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,559
>> Yeah, I was laughing when I was on my

875
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,159
way over thinking that uh, mo so many

876
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,720
people that I worked with at the Broad

877
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,039
now are in industry whether it's venture

878
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,240
or pharma or biotech in all different

879
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,919
kinds of roles. And so many of the

880
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,000
people that I worked with that were in

881
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,919
venture biotech and industry are now,

882
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,600
you know, in academics and at the broad.

883
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,600
And so, uh, at least for me from when I

884
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,080
started, everything feels so much more

885
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,840
flexible now where there's there's many

886
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,440
different paths you can go on, you know,

887
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,399
in and out of all these different types

888
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,080
of organizations. And so I to me I

889
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,320
wouldn't be so um uh fixed on the path

890
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,240
but really like at each step you only

891
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,840
have so many opportunities you know that

892
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,600
present at any moment in time when

893
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,200
you're thinking about your next step and

894
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,159
just choosing the one that that seems

895
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,840
most exciting where you learn the most.

896
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,440
>> Yes, I would echo the learn the most

897
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,799
part. Right. So I think a few years ago

898
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,200
there was a lot of movement right from

899
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,799
grad school to industry. If you go five

900
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,720
years before that you definitely needed

901
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,040
a posttock. I think we're back in an era

902
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,359
where the job market's a lot tighter.

903
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,119
So, you know, having more experience can

904
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,879
differentiate you, especially, you know,

905
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,440
even if it's more academic experience.

906
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,280
So, just, you know, I think a lot of it

907
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,200
also obviously depends on, you know, how

908
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,119
you fit the roles that that they're

909
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,119
looking for. Is there a special skill

910
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,800
set? Is there, you know, a secret sauce

911
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,639
that you are you coming from a lab that

912
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,480
is super relevant to the company that

913
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,800
that you're applying to? I think um you

914
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,240
know there's you know what is it you're

915
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,599
going to learn in your posttock what is

916
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,280
it that you're going to be establishing

917
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,720
one of the things back when we really

918
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,679
required posttos one of the things we

919
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,520
were looking for there was typically

920
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,359
grad students are less independent in

921
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,280
terms of their project planning project

922
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,440
selection um than than grad students

923
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,720
right um that's not necessarily the case

924
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,280
and it really depends on whose lab

925
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,160
you're in you know and the structure of

926
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,000
that um so think about the ways you know

927
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,440
your your skills have developed. The

928
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,839
other thing I'll just say is that you

929
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,119
know grad school you don't ever know

930
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,839
when it's going to end right you've got

931
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,680
this sort of long time horizon posttocks

932
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,599
are different right I did a two-year

933
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,680
posttock a lot of people I know did

934
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,520
shorter posttocks you know especially if

935
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,040
you do an industry posttock you know

936
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,839
those tend to be two or three years

937
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,440
right so it is you know think about what

938
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,440
you'll learn in in that situation if

939
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,680
it's worth it if it makes sense um I

940
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,000
will say you know at nois we had a ton

941
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,560
of this is a really really robust and

942
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,320
and wellrespected postto program. Every

943
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,720
posttock I know from Novartis has gone

944
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,160
on to fantastic industry jobs. There is

945
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,680
probably no better way to build an

946
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,040
industry network because between the

947
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,400
people at Novartis and the people who

948
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,480
leave Noardis while you're there, you

949
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,960
will know somebody in like, you know,

950
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,599
100 companies in the Boston area and

951
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,920
beyond. So, um, but again, it really

952
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,079
will depend on your situation, but there

953
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,920
are so many things you would learn in in

954
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,920
some of those, you know, environments as

955
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,920
well.

956
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,760
Um, so I'm wondering how you see

957
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,839
opportunities for scientists evolving

958
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,400
outside of academia in the next 5 to 10

959
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:17,160
years and if we should be keeping our

960
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,160
eye on specific sectors as we look.

961
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,880
That's a tough question. Um

962
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,079
uh def definitely as uh as we were just

963
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,160
hearing the you know the job market is

964
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,880
changing a lot and industry is changing

965
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,920
a lot. Uh definitely I'm not the person

966
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,359
who's the you know best at uh you know

967
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,839
having the broad view of where we're

968
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,400
headed. Um but the at least from sitting

969
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,079
from the biotech pharma investing side

970
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,800
everything is getting feels like it's

971
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,480
getting so much more global

972
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,520
and so the ability to

973
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,599
to to interact and find the right people

974
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,680
with the right technologies or the right

975
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,839
capital or the right uh clinical sites

976
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,160
on a global basis gets more and more

977
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,079
important. And so

978
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,640
a network in Boston is always a

979
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,839
fantastic thing to have, but I I feel

980
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,839
more and more that the um

981
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,839
there's a lot more balance in terms of

982
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,000
where innovation and where science is

983
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,320
happening and where money is found. And

984
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,320
so having the the broader global view of

985
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,480
of biotech, pharma, drug discovery

986
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,000
industry uh feels more and more

987
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,480
important to me.

988
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,880
I can answer this from the lens of a a

989
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,640
VCM where I see a lot of innovation and

990
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,359
my expectations over the next couple

991
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,599
years. You know, I think it's a a funny

992
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,440
coincidence at RA that many of us on the

993
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,960
investment team actually did PhDs in

994
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,320
neuroscience.

995
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,680
And it's like what, you know, why is

996
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,560
that? And you know one of the reasons

997
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,040
could be that you know 10 years ago um

998
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,320
you know when I when I finished my PhD

999
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,480
it was really hard to develop companies

1000
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,560
um or or start companies or or develop

1001
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,640
drugs in CNS. There are just a lot of

1002
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,160
barriers in terms of accessing the

1003
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,240
brain, getting enough drug across the

1004
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,000
bloodb brain barrier. Um, you know,

1005
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,920
having adequate targets, heterogeneity

1006
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,720
of disease, like lack of understanding

1007
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,720
of the genetic u makeup of of some of

1008
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,839
these more broad buckets of disease like

1009
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,520
autism spectrum disorder. Um and I think

1010
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,440
that there's been a lot of progress

1011
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,040
there over the last couple of years

1012
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,800
especially in in unlocking some of these

1013
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,400
um you know getting drug across the

1014
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,920
brain for example and and better

1015
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,640
understanding of the genetics of some of

1016
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,560
these diseases. So I expect to see some

1017
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,320
more innovation hopefully. I think it's

1018
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,200
a huge unmet need. You know, I kind of

1019
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,320
heard that, you know, there's been so

1020
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,079
much innovation in cancer biology and

1021
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,800
drugs for cancer because we understand

1022
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,200
the genetics and have the ability to do,

1023
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,520
you know, very specific and targeted uh

1024
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,040
drug development approaches and we're

1025
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,040
getting there with neuroscience. So, I I

1026
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,760
think that that is definitely an area

1027
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,359
that I really hope that we'll see more

1028
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,359
innovation over the next 5 to 10 years.

1029
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,040
Hello.

1030
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,480
Um, I'm wondering if you could go back,

1031
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,240
is there anything you would have done

1032
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,240
differently to prepare for your career?

1033
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,280
There is nothing I would have done

1034
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,320
differently. I feel like the fact that I

1035
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,480
I did nothing to prepare for my career

1036
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,160
um actually made me kind of the best

1037
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,680
employee at RA Capital and probably one

1038
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,520
of the reasons why I was so successful.

1039
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,000
like I I came in with a completely blank

1040
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,960
slate and I just wanted to absorb and

1041
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,800
learn and ask questions and you know I

1042
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,079
was able to kind of learn on the job

1043
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,640
which is really cool to have the

1044
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,320
opportunity to do it. Um and so you know

1045
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,560
I can't say that I would have changed a

1046
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,560
single thing.

1047
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,480
>> I would probably just tell myself to be

1048
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,839
more patient. Um

1049
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,000
he's laughing. That's my husband over

1050
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,920
there. Uh because I think there were

1051
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,240
times where I was super frustrated that

1052
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,079
things weren't going as fast as I wanted

1053
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,359
or I wasn't getting a promotion as fast

1054
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,680
and like I think you know there's so

1055
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,720
many things I learned along the way. so

1056
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,880
many there were times when I took a more

1057
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,480
lateral move which gave me actually so

1058
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,240
much more breadth of experience and I I

1059
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,400
don't think I even understood at the

1060
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,000
time how valuable that breadth of

1061
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,040
experience would be in addition to kind

1062
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,440
of the depth you get in a PhD and so you

1063
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,920
know just having a bit more patience

1064
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,560
because you know then things all kind of

1065
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,560
clicked into place

1066
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,359
>> yeah and I would say for my current role

1067
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,720
you know I don't think there's anything

1068
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,079
that I could have or should have done

1069
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,839
differently that would have put me in a

1070
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,440
better place to do what I'm doing now.

1071
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,720
For me, it's more the question of what

1072
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,920
if I had done something completely

1073
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,119
different and how would my life be

1074
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,000
different? But that's, you know, that

1075
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,599
that's sort of more of a life question,

1076
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,599
you know, like gee, what if I had gone

1077
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,200
to med school instead of, you know, or

1078
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,800
what if I had X or Y or Z. But as far as

1079
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,720
being prepared to do the job of an

1080
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,880
editor, I feel like, you know, the

1081
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,040
things that, you know, I did along the

1082
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,160
way equip me well to do to do the job

1083
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,160
that I'm doing.

1084
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,599
No, I mean I the same. Yeah, I wouldn't

1085
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,839
do anything differently, but also no

1086
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,359
step was predictable along the way. And

1087
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,680
you have to stay true to your own

1088
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,680
personalities and interests. And there's

1089
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,200
people that I know that I admire so much

1090
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,040
where they knew exactly where they

1091
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,440
wanted to head and they, you know,

1092
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,839
charted the path to get to to where they

1093
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,760
wanted to be in an amazing way. I know

1094
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,200
other people like me too that you know

1095
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,960
you had no idea where you wanted to head

1096
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,440
and you just kind of took it as it came

1097
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,079
and and that worked out and um but it's

1098
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,839
it's what you know it's what makes you

1099
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,200
excited every morning to get up and do

1100
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,079
what you're doing that makes the most

1101
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,240
difference.

1102
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,240
I have a kind of a related question but

1103
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,079
you all kind of change path a little

1104
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,760
bit. Did you learn it on the job? like

1105
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,520
you said, yeah, but did you get also

1106
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,920
some extra formal training like I don't

1107
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,400
know in business or whatever to help you

1108
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,400
be successful in the new job or

1109
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,040
>> Yeah, I have to say um both Santa Fe and

1110
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,880
Novartis had really fantastic um

1111
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,000
programs around management and around

1112
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,960
business. I did like a mini MBA I

1113
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,480
wouldn't really I don't think anyone

1114
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,880
with an MBA would call really call that

1115
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,560
but you know program at at Santa Fe. Um

1116
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,400
that was super helpful to sort of learn

1117
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,280
more about the business uh side of

1118
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,200
things. when I was at um Noardis, they

1119
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,160
had really fantastic management

1120
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,839
training. Um and not just the training

1121
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,680
itself, but because you did those as a

1122
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,440
cohort with people, it was also like a

1123
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,440
really fantastic bonding experience with

1124
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,960
a smaller group of your colleagues from

1125
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,640
across the organization actually, which

1126
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,440
is also really important in a big place

1127
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,359
like that. Um the other training that

1128
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,119
I've sought out over the years is also

1129
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,960
mentoring programs through things like

1130
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,359
AWIS or HBA um which have all been

1131
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,920
fantastic and um are things that really

1132
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,440
also can grow with you. Um I was also

1133
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,680
part of a group at at Google Ventures.

1134
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,760
So I think really seeking out these

1135
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:15,000
things both inside your organization and

1136
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,000
external um can be super super powerful.

1137
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,560
>> Yeah, I definitely echo that. So, so I

1138
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,960
did like all the training in and what I

1139
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,319
actually do in my role. I received um

1140
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,040
you know in in my capacity at AR Capital

1141
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,720
like I'm so lucky and grateful to have

1142
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,880
such incredible mentors there who really

1143
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,720
took the time to take me on and and

1144
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,720
develop me as an investor. You know,

1145
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,560
I've I've paid that forward and and

1146
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,480
taken on a number of of colleagues that

1147
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,960
I work with very closely and and helped

1148
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,839
develop them as well. uh to echo you

1149
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,520
know a for example I was a mentee there

1150
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,200
back in the day and actually it was

1151
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,119
coincidental is at the time that I was

1152
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,440
interviewing for my job at Ari Capital

1153
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,520
so they helped me talk through like how

1154
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,839
to negotiate a salary like that's

1155
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,880
terrifying especially coming out of your

1156
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:03,440
PhD where I'm like I make $30,000 a year

1157
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,480
like I will literally work for you know

1158
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,359
for that um so you know it's a starting

1159
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,920
point um but yeah and you know then I

1160
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,560
became a mentor uh down the So certainly

1161
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,160
seek out opportunities like that. Um

1162
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,119
there's there's a lot that you can do if

1163
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,119
you're interested in biotech investing.

1164
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,720
This is going to sound really silly. Um

1165
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,920
but probably the best thing you can do

1166
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,839
is follow what we call like bio Twitter.

1167
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,599
Um go on Twitter and follow a bunch of

1168
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,359
personalities who like follow these

1169
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,280
stocks really closely, follow the data

1170
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,119
coming out. It's kind of good exposure

1171
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,920
into what it would be like to actually

1172
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,920
be in that world. Um, but yeah, I I

1173
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,760
can't say that, you know, like reading a

1174
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,920
textbook on how to make a financial

1175
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,280
model is going to be very helpful.

1176
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,040
>> Yeah, I would actually just also there's

1177
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,440
a lot there's a couple podcasts out

1178
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,440
there. Um, there's Biotech Hangout which

1179
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,119
covers a lot of those Twitter folks. Um,

1180
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,720
and actually I'll make a plug for the RA

1181
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,119
Capital website because there's a lot of

1182
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,119
learning stuff on there. Um, it's

1183
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,800
actually really and it's all freely

1184
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,560
available. There's a lot of just like

1185
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,200
how does companies like how does this

1186
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,000
work this investing thing like at a at a

1187
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,800
high level but that's really I think a

1188
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,079
good place to start as a as a scientist.

1189
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,520
>> Yeah. And I think what everybody has

1190
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,119
said there's there's formal and there's

1191
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,720
informal ways to learn what you need to

1192
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,400
learn same as PhD or not doing a PhD but

1193
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,760
the one is learn you know learning the

1194
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,359
things you need to know but the other

1195
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,040
part that's so important is meeting the

1196
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,280
people that help open up the

1197
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,760
opportunities to take a new job to be a

1198
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,760
mentor. And so wherever are the places

1199
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,240
where you both learn but also broaden

1200
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,160
the people whose uh you know you build

1201
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,480
relationships with who can mentor you

1202
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,040
who you can uh you know you can mentor

1203
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,440
over time as well. Uh and there's lots

1204
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,280
of ways to do that but it's it helps a

1205
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,920
lot to continue to learn but also

1206
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:52,040
continue to to meet new people and and

1207
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,040
hear their thoughts as you go.

1208
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,440
Um, so we're running at the end of time

1209
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,599
and I thought we would end with just

1210
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,520
everyone giving their last piece of

1211
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,880
advice. Maybe keep it to a sentence or

1212
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:09,720
two um of uh for the trainee in the room

1213
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,720
seeking non-academic career paths.

1214
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,960
I I would say um try to know yourself

1215
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,720
and pursue the thing that you think

1216
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,839
lines up best with your skills,

1217
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,240
interests, and heart.

1218
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,040
Yeah, keep coming to things like this.

1219
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,599
Look for organizations like AIS, like

1220
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,680
HBA, like um you know, various

1221
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,599
scientific organizations. Uh look for

1222
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,160
ways to share your science and yeah,

1223
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,800
>> I'd say keep an open mind and and stay

1224
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,319
curious. You know, if I had actually had

1225
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,480
the opportunity to dismiss finance as I,

1226
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,000
you know, my gut was to do, I would have

1227
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,079
never ended up where I am. And I

1228
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,640
absolutely love what I do. Um, so just

1229
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,240
keep an open mind.

1230
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,800
>> Yeah, there's just so many opportunities

1231
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,880
and they're they're as exciting science

1232
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,280
as what you do in academics, but just

1233
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,119
from different aspects. And so so don't

1234
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,480
be afraid. Uh there's just so many

1235
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,960
different opportunities that are all

1236
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:12,079
terrific uh to be able to pursue.

1237
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,319
I think we can end for folks here, we

1238
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,319
all meet over there at 9:30 for the

1239
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,319
talk.
