1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,360
All right, let's get started. Uh,

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,320
welcome back to 61200. I am the second

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,800
of the three lecturers in this class.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,439
Uh, you can call me Eric. Um, and

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
Binmore will be on next week. Uh so

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,000
today we are going to uh continue our

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
theme of induction and prove some even

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,440
cooler and stronger forms of induction.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,840
Just a recap of where we were last time.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
As we've seen, we're we're growing our

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,079
catalog of different proof techniques of

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,040
how to prove uh different types of

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,480
theorems almost by like a cookbook. If

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,879
you want to cook this, here's how you

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,960
get started. And so here's a a brief

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,879
summary of this. uh if the theorem you

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
want to prove starts with there exists

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,520
something then a natural way to prove

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,120
that is by example or by construction

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,840
you construct a particular x star and

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
prove that p of xstar is true and if you

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
can do that uh then you've proved that

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
there exists an x where p of x is true

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
it's kind of straightforward but it lets

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
you unwrap if I give you an expression

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,479
starts with exist then you know your

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
first step is try to figure out an x

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,600
where this is true um and of course to

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,400
prove p of xar you probably recur

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,840
cursively use this cookbook. If you want

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,080
to prove a universal uh one common way

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,159
if you want to prove for all x p of x is

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,720
true uh typically your first line is

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,280
take an arbitrary x just give it a name

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,799
x and then prove that p of x is true no

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,600
matter what x you started with therefore

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,759
it's true for all of them. Uh come back

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,040
to induction in a second. If you're if

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,159
the main thing you want to prove is an

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,680
implication, P implies Q. This is if P

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,360
then Q. And I want to remind you that um

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,079
P implies Q is the same thing as not P

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,600
or Q. We'll use this a bunch uh today.

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,439
Um then uh the direct way to prove this

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,079
what we call a direct argument is assume

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,680
P is true and then prove Q is true.

47
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,319
Because this implication we only need to

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,480
prove that Q is true when P is true. If

49
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,879
P then Q. Uh or another way to prove

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,400
that same statement P implies Q is

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
what's called the contraositive. It

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
turns out P implies Q is the same

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
statement. It's equivalent to not Q

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,920
implies not P. Remember this uh symbol

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,040
is a negation

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,800
um flip true and false. So to do that

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,239
with a direct argument we would prove

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
that uh if not Q is true then not P is

59
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,560
true. In other words, assume not Q and

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,720
then prove not P.

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,680
This may seem kind of magical. Why is P

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,400
implies Q the same as not Q implies not

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,760
P? But it actually follows directly from

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:55,120
this equivalence. If you look at not Q

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:59,519
implies not P. Uh this is the same thing

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,040
as let me go over here. Not not Q or not

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,040
P,

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
right? because it implies is the same

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,239
thing as taking an or if you negate the

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,879
first the part on the left and not not Q

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:16,319
is the same as Q.

72
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,760
Okay, so this was uh not Q implies not P

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
is the same thing as this is the same

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,560
thing as this and that is exactly this

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,800
uh just by switching the order of the

76
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,720
ors and so P implies Q is the same thing

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,400
as not Q implies not P uh more uh so

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,280
that was contraositive there's a related

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,799
notion of contradiction where if you

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,920
want to prove any statement P um you

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,159
assume that not P is true and then find

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,400
a contradiction prove that in fact false

83
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,560
is true or something is both true and

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,959
false. All these things are very very

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
bad because we assume that our axioms

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,280
are consistent. And so if you can prove

87
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,920
false that means that what you assumed

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
must also be false.

89
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,599
Uh and if so if not P is false that's

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
the same thing as saying P is true.

91
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,040
Feels very backwards. Lots of double

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
negatives in there but that's the nature

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
of contradiction. We try to avoid them

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,599
when we can but sometimes it's really

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,159
the right way to prove something. And

96
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
the last technique we saw was induction.

97
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,080
uh where if we have a universal

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,360
quantifier over the natural numbers, we

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
want to prove P of N is true for all

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,160
natural numbers 0 1 2 3 and so on. Uh

101
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,560
then we only need to prove it for some

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,720
base case P of 0 and then we need to

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
prove that P of N implies P of N plus

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,759
one for all N. So we'll talk more about

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,479
induction in a little bit. Uh

106
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,120
today we're going to add to this list

107
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,199
two more proof techniques. One is proof

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
by cases and the other is strong

109
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,520
induction. So proof by cases is just a

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,240
nice general technique to be aware of.

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,400
Uh it's can be very powerful. Strong

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,040
induction is going to be an even cooler

113
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,680
form of induction.

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,560
All right. But we'll start today with

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,440
proof by cases. And we'll start with

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,440
proof by two cases.

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,199
and then we'll generalize to more than

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,199
two cases.

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,400
So, uh the idea is take any proposition

120
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
C

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:30,360
and observe that C or not C is a

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
tautology

123
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,400
meaning uh always true.

124
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,160
Okay, if C is true, then this whole

125
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,880
thing is true because C is true. If C is

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,720
false, then not C is true. And so this

127
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,280
whole thing is true. I'm going to remind

128
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,840
you uh this uh so V symbol is an or.

129
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,520
Uh whereas the opposite symbol is an

130
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
and.

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
I think the pneumonic here is this looks

132
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
like a letter A. This looks like a

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,280
letter O. I've heard some people say

134
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,120
this looks like a lowercase R for or. Um

135
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,080
anyway, you just remember these things.

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,720
This is or this is and uh so C or not C

137
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,800
is the question no is always true. Uh so

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,880
we call it a tautology fancy word for

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,880
being always true. And so uh

140
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,720
what this tells us is that our

141
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,800
proposition P let's say we want to prove

142
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,800
P is equivalent to

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,800
uh C or not C

144
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,319
implies P.

145
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,880
So this is saying if C or not C then P

146
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,639
is true. C or not C is just always true.

147
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,800
So this is saying if true in other words

148
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,800
always P better be true. So P and this

149
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,240
implication are equivalent. Another way

150
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,440
to see that is to rewrite this

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:04,160
implication as uh a negation I guess. So

152
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,039
this is like saying not uh true

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,039
or P and so that's just the same thing

154
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:14,000
as P

155
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:17,680
because this is true.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,080
Okay, cool. Uh so I want to rewrite this

157
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,479
a little bit and say this thing is

158
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,960
equivalent to C implies P and not C

159
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,960
implies P.

160
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,400
Uh why is this true? Uh it's like a

161
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,280
distributive law. This is saying I want

162
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,360
to prove that C implies P and I want to

163
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
prove that not C implies P. That's what

164
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,160
I wrote over there. Uh that implies that

165
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,240
the combination of C and not C implies

166
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
P.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
Okay. So I claim these are equivalent.

168
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,039
You could one way to verify it is with

169
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,199
the truth table or you can do it with

170
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,599
some manipulation.

171
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,759
All right. So uh we have

172
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,919
uh what this is saying is in order to

173
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,240
prove P we need to prove that P is true

174
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,560
assuming C and prove that P is true

175
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,520
assuming not C. And these are the two

176
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,720
cases and proof by cases. Let me write

177
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,720
out a little template for you.

178
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,520
Let's suppose the theorem we want to

179
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,919
prove

180
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,919
is P.

181
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,319
Theorem means something that's true and

182
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,880
that we're about to prove.

183
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
Uh and so we'd usually say proof by

184
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,440
cases

185
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,440
on the truth value

186
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:48,120
of C. So this is uh for any

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,120
uh

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,720
statement seek

189
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
proposition is what the word I was

190
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,680
looking for. Any proposition C, it's

191
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,680
either true or false.

192
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,080
Uh and so we're going to do proof by

193
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,320
cases on the truth value of C. Case one

194
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:13,880
is that C is true

195
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,880
and case two is that C is false.

196
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,040
And so what do we do in each case? Uh

197
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,519
well in the case that C is true this

198
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,519
means that we get to assume that C is

199
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,519
true

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,560
uh and then use that to prove that P is

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,760
true. And so the the missing step in

202
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,760
this uh proof outline or this template

203
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,880
uh is we need to say P is true because

204
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,760
some reasons which we need to fill in.

205
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,200
uh and similarly in the else in the C is

206
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,880
false case we need to prove P is true

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,399
uh

208
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,080
for some reasons. Okay, so we need twice

209
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,920
as many reasons but the idea is that

210
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,399
maybe assuming C is true makes it easier

211
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,040
to prove P is true. Maybe also proving

212
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
assuming C is false makes it easier to

213
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,200
to prove that P is true. So in these

214
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,160
boxes here we get to use C and in here

215
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,839
we get to use not C. And often this

216
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,240
makes proofs easier. But the challenging

217
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,320
part is to pick the correct C. What's

218
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,399
the right choice of C for this to be

219
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,800
true. Um, and maybe one more line I want

220
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,600
to add to this template, which is pretty

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,040
obvious in this setting, but gets much

222
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,200
less obvious when you think about more

223
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,560
than two cases. So a final step in this

224
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,600
proof would be to say uh C is either

225
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,880
true or false because all propositions

226
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:50,959
are either true or false.

227
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,720
And so uh the cases are exhaustive.

228
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,880
So this is also called a proof by

229
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,279
exhaustion. Not because we're really

230
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,120
tired, maybe we are also. But the idea

231
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,040
is we want to exhaust all possible

232
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,040
cases. And if we prove that we we

233
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,760
captured every possible situation and

234
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,320
all of them P is true then we're done.

235
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,680
Okay. So that's what we'd like to do.

236
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm going to give you two examples.

237
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,959
First one is very simple. The second one

238
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,959
is more interesting

239
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,959
questions. All right. Um,

240
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,040
so the claim is this is a general fact

241
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,360
that a implies b or b implies c is a

242
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,240
tautology. So this means it's always

243
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,519
true again. So you can rewrite this as

244
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,000
for all a, b and c uh which are either

245
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,000
true or false

246
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:08,440
uh we have that a implies b or b implies

247
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,440
c is true.

248
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:17,120
Okay, fun fun fact. Um let's prove it.

249
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:23,200
And the proof technique we're going to

250
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:28,839
use by cases by two cases namely uh on B

251
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,839
B is either true or false.

252
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,959
We could try to do a case analysis in

253
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
terms of A or in terms of C. Turns out B

254
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,600
is sort of the right answer here. It

255
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
will lead to the fewest cases. We'll

256
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,079
only need two uh intuitively because B

257
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,399
is in both of these expressions. So it

258
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,680
seems good to split on B because it will

259
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,440
impact this one and this one.

260
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,519
Okay. Uh so

261
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,720
case one

262
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,720
is that B is true.

263
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,200
Okay.

264
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,920
uh if B is true, I claim that A implies

265
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,360
B is true,

266
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,040
which is this first half.

267
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,440
Why?

268
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,680
Uh in other words, I I claim that A

269
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,680
implies true is a tautology.

270
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,639
I think another again an easy way to see

271
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,519
this is to rewrite uh rewrite this

272
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,279
implication as not the left hand side or

273
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,519
the right hand side.

274
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,120
Right? Not a or true. Well, that's just

275
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:40,560
true. True or anything is true. Okay?

276
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,040
So, in particular over here, uh not a or

277
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,959
b is true because we just assume that b

278
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,200
is true.

279
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:52,959
Okay. So, this tells us that uh a

280
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:56,639
implies b or anything in particular b or

281
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,199
c is also true.

282
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,120
Okay. So, kind of trivial, right? Right?

283
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,480
If you assume B is true, then of course

284
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,800
this is true and so of course the whole

285
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,959
thing is true.

286
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,720
So easy when you have the correct case.

287
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,360
Uh let's think about the other case.

288
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,959
It's not enough to just have one half of

289
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,519
the cases. We also need to think about

290
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,519
when B is false.

291
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:23,279
When B is false, I claim that the other

292
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,199
term is true. I claim that B implies C

293
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,399
is true.

294
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,720
Uh this is maybe a little less

295
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,440
intuitive. This is saying that false

296
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,399
implies C is a tautology like for any C

297
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
false implies it. Um and this should

298
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,079
eventually become intuitive for you when

299
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,519
you get used to implies and if then this

300
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:47,440
is saying if false which means never uh

301
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,440
I need C to be true. But if I if this

302
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,519
condition is never true then I don't

303
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,320
care about the right hand side. If it's

304
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:59,360
if you know if uh pigs fly then I don't

305
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,440
know apples are orange or something. Um

306
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
it that's a true statement because it

307
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,880
will never be the case that pigs fly at

308
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,040
least in the present time. So uh another

309
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,279
way to see that is to think about again

310
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,120
not B or C.

311
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,560
B is false so not B is true and so of

312
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,399
course true or C is also true.

313
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:27,279
Okay. And so that tells us that anything

314
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:30,399
or B implies C is also true.

315
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,120
So in other words, this statement

316
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,120
maybe I'll call P, I'll say in either

317
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,120
case

318
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,160
P is true. And so I write my little end

319
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,880
of crew symbol. This is QED from last

320
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,240
time. Uh this means that I have

321
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
demonstrated the theorem.

322
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,199
Cool. So in one case this part was

323
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,959
trivial. In the other case this part was

324
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,120
trivial because it's an or. We're happy

325
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,519
in either case. And we've done our proof

326
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
first proof by cases. Pretty

327
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,120
straightforward.

328
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,920
Let's do a more surprising result

329
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,680
using proof by cases called

330
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,800
mutual

331
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,800
friends and strangers.

332
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,040
This is actually a famous mathematical

333
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,440
problem we're going to solve today a

334
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:29,240
particular case of it

335
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,240
which is suppose you have six people

336
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:35,519
um and every two of them are either

337
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,519
friends or

338
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,880
uh and this is an exclusive or so. So

339
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,839
I'm going to write exor. You're allowed

340
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,480
to be friends or or not friends, not

341
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,839
both and not neither. And in the not

342
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,560
friends case, I'm also going to call

343
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,480
them uh strangers.

344
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,880
So this is like extreme friendship.

345
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,720
Either you declare yourself as friends

346
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,000
or as knowing each other or you don't

347
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,000
know each other. In that case, you're

348
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
strangers. You're just never both. It's

349
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
always one or the other. Okay? So, you

350
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,799
can think of this as I can draw a little

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
picture of their six people represent by

352
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,319
circles. You can put smiley faces in

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,199
them if you want. And maybe I connect

354
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,079
them via a white line if they are

355
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,679
friends and a dotted line if they're

356
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:32,440
strangers. So let's And every two of

357
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,440
them have one of these two pictures.

358
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,320
Probably missing some

359
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,679
here.

360
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,000
That's them all. Uh then

361
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,000
I claim

362
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
no matter how what the situation is,

363
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,520
which ones are friends, which ones are

364
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,640
strangers, there's always

365
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,640
uh either

366
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,840
three mutual friends

367
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,400
for

368
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,400
three mutual strangers.

369
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,600
Okay, in this example,

370
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:27,280
hopefully I drew enough. Yeah. Uh, these

371
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,840
three people are mutual strangers.

372
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,039
They're connected by a a triangle of

373
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,480
dashed lines. Okay. If I drew some other

374
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,480
pattern, like if they were all solid

375
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,320
lines, then uh I might get the other

376
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,000
situation, at least three mutual

377
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,000
friends. But it turns out if you have

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
six people, they're always at least

379
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,640
three mutual friends or three mutual

380
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,640
strangers. Let's prove this by cases.

381
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,480
Whenever we apply a proof by cases, we

382
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,559
need to come up with some proposition C

383
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,400
that's either true or false. Well, for a

384
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,039
proof by two cases, which this will be

385
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,000
uh and it's a little work in this case

386
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:21,400
to to do it. It turns out a useful first

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,400
step is to pick any person P.

388
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,160
So just take the first person or the

389
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,880
seventh or the the fifth person ahead of

390
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,200
six doesn't matter which one but label

391
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,640
it P. So now we have a person to talk

392
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,039
about. This is sort of like the proof by

393
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,039
example or by construction right we want

394
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,480
to overall there we want to prove an

395
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,000
existence we want to prove existence of

396
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,080
three mutual friends or existence of

397
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,520
three mutual strangers. So it's a useful

398
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,799
step to either construct one or in this

399
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,840
case we're actually not doing much of a

400
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
construction. We're just taking an

401
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,080
arbitrary X, but that will be enough for

402
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,840
this for this problem. Okay, so let me

403
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,039
draw a little circle for P.

404
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,760
Uh, and it might have some friends and

405
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,440
it might have some strangers. Okay, how

406
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,240
many of these lines coming out of P are

407
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,799
there? Five. Exactly. Because there's

408
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,520
six people total. P is one of them. So

409
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:20,720
there are five people over here.

410
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:26,240
Okay, so turns out useful case strategy

411
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,960
is to uh say either P has at least three

412
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,360
friends

413
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
or it has less than three friends,

414
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,039
right? Either there are three solid

415
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,480
lines like I've drawn here or there at

416
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,720
least three or they're at most two solid

417
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,559
lines. Okay, let's think about this

418
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,120
first case. P has at least three

419
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:50,960
friends. Let's uh give them a name

420
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,120
uh Q, R, and S.

421
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,960
So uh that's sort of a general picture.

422
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:02,720
Now we're assuming P has three solid

423
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,559
lines to three people Q, R, and S.

424
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay, this is not yet a triangle. We

425
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,240
haven't solved the problem yet, but uh

426
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,880
if we break into more cases, we'll be

427
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,720
able to. Okay. So, uh case

428
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,600
1 A is going to be

429
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:28,440
uh sum two

430
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,440
of Q, R and S are friends.

431
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,120
Okay. Suppose

432
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:39,679
uh for example Q and S are friends. Have

433
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,799
I found a triangle? Yes. P Q and S are

434
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,480
mutual friends. If this edge is here or

435
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,960
if this edge is here then these three

436
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,559
people are three mutual friends or if

437
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,559
this edge is here these three people are

438
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,039
mutual friends. If there's any edge in

439
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,760
here that I can draw any uh solid line

440
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,360
between QR and S then those two people

441
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,320
plus P form three mutual friends.

442
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,840
Okay. So that case is actually easy.

443
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:10,640
Great.

444
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:14,600
Then uh P plus those two people

445
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,600
are three mutual friends.

446
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,480
Okay, which uh was situation one up

447
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,919
here. There's always either three mutual

448
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,919
friends or three mutual strangers.

449
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,640
Okay, uh so now we need to think about

450
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,000
the other cases. Let's go over here.

451
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,480
We found one case that was easy, but uh

452
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,919
there's case 1B, which is maybe there

453
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,400
aren't two mutual friends, and there's

454
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,799
case two where P does not have at least

455
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,360
three friends. Okay, but it turns out

456
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:52,400
all of these cases will be easy. So,

457
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,559
let's do uh case 1 B.

458
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,080
Now, I get to sort of freely choose what

459
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,919
case one was, and I get to freely choose

460
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,520
what case 1 A was because whenever I

461
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,760
split into cases, I get to choose my

462
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,760
proposition C to be anything I want. So

463
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,240
this was C in the first case. This was C

464
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,840
in the second case. But generally if

465
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,159
you're doing proof by two cases, you

466
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,200
have no choice at this point. So case 1

467
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,440
A was whatever. Case 1 B has to be the

468
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,919
negation of this.

469
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:24,159
Okay. So case 1B literally is uh not sum

470
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,600
to uh of QRS are friends. Uh but if you

471
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,799
think about that for a little bit, this

472
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,799
is saying um

473
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:41,919
Q R and S uh let me let me write this uh

474
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:45,960
in a couple of steps. No two of Q R and

475
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,960
S are friends.

476
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,159
But that's the same thing as saying QR

477
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,159
and S are mutual strangers.

478
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,799
Okay, we're using this fact or this

479
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,400
assumption that every two people are

480
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,320
either friends or strangers.

481
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,120
Always one or the other. So if there's

482
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,880
no solid line over here, then all of

483
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,320
these are dash lines. So all three of

484
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,440
these are mutual strangers. And there we

485
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,000
found our triangle of strangers.

486
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,080
Okay. So it turns out case 1 A and case

487
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,960
1 B are actually just as easy, just sort

488
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,360
of reversed. Uh so this was situation

489
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,440
two.

490
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
So either we got three mutual friends or

491
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,120
we got three mutual strangers, but we're

492
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,440
still inside case one. We just finished

493
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,000
case one. Now we need to think about

494
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,960
case two. So I'm going to unindent here

495
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,120
and go to case two.

496
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,080
Case two again has to be exactly the

497
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,400
opposite of this. So P does not have at

498
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,240
least three friends.

499
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Uh by

500
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:04,480
number of people being an integer. This

501
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,840
is saying P has at most two friends.

502
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,840
Okay. If it doesn't have at least three,

503
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,440
it's at most two because number of

504
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,600
friends is always an integer.

505
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,520
Okay, great. So that case two is a

506
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,320
negation of case one. Um, and it turns

507
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,279
out that is also kind of easy for a

508
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,000
symmetric reason. Uh, remember there are

509
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,960
six people total. So there's P and five

510
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,640
others.

511
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,640
So uh, how many strangers

512
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,480
is P with or how many people is P a

513
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,440
stranger to?

514
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,760
Uh, well, it's at least uh, all the

515
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,440
others. 5 minus 2 is at most two of them

516
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,840
are friends. The remainder have to be

517
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,600
strangers. And so this is three.

518
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,120
So P having at most two friends is the

519
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,000
same thing as P having at least three

520
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:05,039
strangers because there are five other

521
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,440
people total. 2 + 3 is 5. Uh so P case

522
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,200
two is P has at least three strangers.

523
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,840
Case one was P has at least three

524
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,080
friends. These are almost the same. I

525
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,600
just have to flip friends versus

526
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,360
strangers.

527
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:23,159
So the way I would write this in a proof

528
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,159
is uh this is symmetric

529
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,799
to case one

530
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,799
uh

531
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,799
swapping

532
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,799
friends uh versus strangers.

533
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,919
And of course uh case one or situation

534
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,000
one with situation two.

535
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,679
Okay. So case two would be P has at

536
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,600
least three strangers QR and S. Case 1 A

537
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,000
is that sum two of QR and S are

538
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,720
strangers. Then we conclude that P plus

539
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,799
those two are three mutual strangers

540
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:06,320
which is situation two. Or case 2B would

541
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,039
be no two of QRS are strangers. In other

542
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,360
words, QRS are mutual friends. And then

543
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,440
we're in situation one. So case two

544
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,720
works just like case one just swapping

545
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,840
the words friends and strangers because

546
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,799
they didn't really have any meaning.

547
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,320
They were just words.

548
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,520
Cool. So in all cases

549
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,080
uh we prove the desired result either

550
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,159
situation one or situation two happens.

551
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,279
Um this is a particular case of

552
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,279
something called Ramsey theory.

553
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:46,880
What we've just found is that something

554
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:51,039
called r of 33 is uh at most six uh in

555
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,240
general r of f comma s is the number of

556
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,799
people you need uh in order to guarantee

557
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,360
that there's at least f friends or at

558
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,799
least s strangers. So we just did at

559
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,480
least three friends or at least three

560
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,279
strangers. We showed that six people was

561
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,520
enough. It turns out uh six people is

562
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,880
exactly the right number. You need six

563
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,760
people in order to guarantee at least

564
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,120
three friends or three strangers. If you

565
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:21,279
wanted to guarantee four friends or four

566
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:23,760
strangers, turns out you need 18 people.

567
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,240
Uh if you want to guarantee five friends

568
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:32,720
or five strangers, turns out you need uh

569
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,360
somewhere between 43 and 48 people. But

570
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,720
we don't know how many. So while this

571
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,159
problem was relatively easy, three

572
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,080
friends or three strangers, five friends

573
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,480
and five strangers already is an

574
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,720
unsolved mathematical problem. So that's

575
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,679
kind of cool and crazy how easily you

576
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,200
get to very difficult problems. Of

577
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,039
course, people try to compute larger

578
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,559
numbers too, but we don't have tight

579
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,559
bounds generally.

580
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,360
Okay, I want to say one more thing about

581
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,880
proof by cases, which is what if we want

582
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,399
more than two cases?

583
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:13,080
Uh so

584
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:13,080
more generally proof by K cases.

585
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,840
So instead of just C or not C, let's

586
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,799
suppose we have a bunch of propositions

587
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,919
C1 through CK. And let's suppose that

588
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,919
this is a tautology.

589
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,240
favorite word for the day. So suppose

590
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,640
that it's always the case C1 or C2 or

591
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,559
dot dot dot or CK one of these things is

592
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,399
always true.

593
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,399
Then uh we can follow this template

594
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:57,360
which is uh suppose we want to prove a

595
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:59,919
theorem that some proposition P is true

596
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,440
then we'll say proof

597
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,279
uh by cases

598
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,799
and

599
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,320
there's K of them so I'm just going to

600
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:14,080
write it generically in case I

601
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:18,000
is that CI is true. In other words, we

602
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,000
get to assume CI is true.

603
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,960
And then what we need to do is prove

604
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,880
that P is true in that scenario. And P

605
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,480
is true

606
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,480
because

607
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,480
reasons.

608
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,399
Uh and then here it's especially

609
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,880
important to say that the cases

610
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,880
are exhaustive.

611
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,320
uh

612
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,120
because

613
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:52,159
reasons and exhaustive here just means

614
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:55,159
that uh C1 or C2 or up to CK is a

615
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,159
tautology.

616
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,640
Okay, so you need to prove that C1 or or

617
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,080
up dot dot dot or CK is is always true.

618
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,279
That's the meaning of the cases being

619
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,720
exhaustive. So there's sort of two

620
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,480
parts. So one is to prove that each case

621
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,360
is okay. The other is to prove that

622
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,240
those cases cover everything.

623
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,679
Okay. So um I won't show an example of K

624
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,840
cases here. We'll see that I'm in

625
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,480
restitation and so on. Uh but I will

626
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,120
tell you a story about one uh famous

627
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,640
proof by cases which is the fourcolor

628
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,799
theorem.

629
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,000
Uh I'll illustrate the four color

630
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:33,360
theorem with an example. So here's a map

631
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,200
of United States. uh and I've colored

632
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,519
all the states, all the regions of this

633
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,080
map with four different colors red,

634
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,159
green, blue, yellow in such a way that

635
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:47,200
if you have two regions that share a

636
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,960
positive length boundary, then this

637
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:54,159
color A is different from this color B.

638
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,519
Okay, it has to be not equal. Otherwise,

639
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,200
if you had two red regions next to each

640
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,200
other, it' be hard to see the boundary.

641
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,240
So the colors illustrate the boundaries

642
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,120
between all the regions. Four colors

643
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,679
seems to be enough for this map. Uh it's

644
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,200
also enough for this map of all the

645
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,600
countries.

646
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Is it true for all the maps? Turns out

647
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,039
yes. This is called for a long time

648
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,360
called the fourcolor conjecture and then

649
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,760
it became the fourcolor theorem at some

650
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,600
date. Uh so fourcolor theorem says you

651
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,880
can color the regions of any planer map

652
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,039
with four colors so the neighboring

653
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,240
regions get different colors. This was

654
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:32,240
first observed and sort of conjectured

655
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,960
uh in 1852 by a guy named Guthrie who

656
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,159
was a student of deorggan. De Morgan I

657
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,200
think his name will come up in a moment

658
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,840
famous logician. He actually invented

659
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,679
induction as we

660
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,279
one of the first people to he invented

661
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,679
the term mathematical induction at the

662
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,440
very least and really uh sort of made it

663
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,440
more formal.

664
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,120
Uh so a student of him Guthrie said hey

665
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I took all the counties of England and

666
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,279
it turned out I only needed four colors

667
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,840
is this a theorem and he asked uh

668
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,640
indirectly de Morgan uh and Morgan said

669
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,279
hey seems cool I don't know maybe then

670
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,720
the following year 1853

671
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,720
uh another mathematician named Kemp

672
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,720
uh

673
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,159
proved the theorem

674
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,760
but uh proved should be in quotes

675
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,240
because uh 11 years later 1864 before

676
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,919
Haywood found a bug in that proof. Turns

677
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,480
out there were a lot of cases in this

678
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:33,039
proof and the cases were not exhaustive.

679
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:37,039
So it wasn't done. Then uh 15 years

680
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,600
later, 1880, Tate proved the theorem.

681
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,519
Then 11 years later, Peterson found a

682
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,440
bug in that proof. Again, not all the

683
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:48,320
cases were exhaustive. Then uh 85 years

684
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,600
later, 1976

685
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:56,039
uh Apple and Haken or maybe it's a PEL,

686
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,039
I'm not sure, uh

687
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
proved the theorem and I think most

688
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,720
people consider this an actual proof. Uh

689
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,399
but it's a little tricky. Uh just to

690
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,159
give you a sense, this this is where

691
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,360
sort of my started I started hearing

692
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,320
about the problem. I wasn't alive in

693
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,480
1976, but I heard about it later on. Um

694
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,119
there are 1,834

695
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,599
cases in this proof. They occupy about a

696
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,760
400page printout from a computer

697
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,000
program. And so th this is one of the

698
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,320
first mathematical proofs that used a

699
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,760
computer to assist in checking all the

700
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,679
cases because there's so many 8 1,834.

701
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,000
It's hard to do that by hand and be sure

702
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,839
that you didn't make a mistake. So the

703
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,119
computer proof to me is a little bit

704
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:42,480
more sound. uh also apparently checked

705
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:45,599
by hand uh by Haken's daughter. Um then

706
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,200
five years later uh Schmidt found what

707
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,720
you could interpret as a bug in this

708
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,760
proof. Let's say an emission or

709
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,599
something uh but a missing situation. Uh

710
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
and then over the next eight years Apple

711
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,680
and Haken fixed all the bugs they could

712
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,520
find that one and some other sort of

713
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,800
wording issues and so on and they

714
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,119
proofed they published it in a book but

715
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,440
book isn't refereed. So I don't know how

716
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,359
many people have read that book. Um,

717
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,880
seems like this proof is maybe correct.

718
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,240
It's been many years and no one has

719
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,480
found a bug. Uh, a little bit later

720
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,880
though, 1996, Robertson, Sanders,

721
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,680
Seymour, and Thomas, some of the top

722
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,880
graph theorists in the world, uh, found

723
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,839
a simpler proof. That proof only has 633

724
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,160
cases. So that's a lot less, maybe three

725
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,160
times fewer cases. And also the length

726
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,040
of the paper is shorter, maybe 10 times

727
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,720
shorter. Uh so that's progress but you

728
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,599
know is that proof true it also used a

729
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,680
computer to check the cases. Uh finally

730
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:47,040
in 2005

731
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:49,520
uh Verer and Gonier uh developed a fully

732
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,560
computer checkable proof using uh a

733
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,440
system called coaul where you write down

734
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,720
uh every step in the proof and then the

735
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,880
computer just has to check that every u

736
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,560
mathematical derivation like all the

737
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,040
derivations we saw last class modus

738
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,400
ponus and all those things are correct.

739
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,359
this this program has been has withstood

740
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,640
many many years of scrutiny. So we all

741
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,160
believe that it's correct and so the

742
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,079
fact that you can write the entire proof

743
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,240
in this proof language suggests that

744
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,480
this really is a true theorem. Now

745
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,960
thankfully there won't be more missing

746
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,200
cases. I believe that is just an

747
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,960
implementation of the Robertson proof.

748
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,480
So uh that one withtood scrutiny but

749
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,040
it's very tedious to write these proofs

750
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,079
and so uh for the fourcolor theorem it's

751
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,000
uh worth it I would say all right so

752
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,000
that's just an example of in general

753
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
proofs by cases can involve a zillion

754
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,680
cases it's very annoying but sometimes

755
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,880
that's the best thing we know how to do

756
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,400
maybe we'll come up with a simpler

757
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,359
fourcolor theorem proof at some point

758
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,520
but best we know so far has hundreds of

759
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:56,160
cases

760
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:58,240
all right let's go back to induction

761
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,480
Uh first I want to review induction a

762
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:06,200
little bit and then we will get a

763
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,200
stronger form of it.

764
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,880
So uh I'm going to call this the

765
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,760
induction axiom. This is what we talked

766
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,000
about last class. Uh we didn't call it

767
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,520
an axiom and in some setups it is an

768
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,599
axiom. We're going to take it as one.

769
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,480
something that we just assume is true.

770
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,040
Uh although as Zach mentioned in modern

771
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,800
times you usually prove this using other

772
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,400
using the definition of the natural

773
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,480
numbers.

774
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,720
Uh but I'll just take it as something is

775
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,560
true. So for any predicate p of n over

776
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:46,160
the natural numbers if on the one hand p

777
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,640
of zero is true

778
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,160
and on the other hand

779
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,440
uh

780
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:59,359
p of n implies p of n + one

781
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,000
uh for all natural numbers n

782
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,200
then

783
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,440
uh p of n is true uh for all natural

784
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,400
numbers

785
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,079
Okay, this is the magic of induction.

786
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,599
You should use this probably in every

787
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,839
problem you solve. Not every problem,

788
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,200
but uh extremely powerful tool. We're

789
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,240
going to use it all the time throughout

790
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,520
this class. I want to give you a visual

791
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,680
way of thinking about what's going on

792
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,680
with induction, which I call block

793
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,680
diagrams.

794
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:40,440
Uh so um I'm going to think of

795
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,440
a block

796
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,800
like a little box here that takes as

797
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,960
input. Think of it as a procedure. You

798
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:55,040
give it some true uh propositions on the

799
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:58,400
left and it produces a true proposition

800
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,400
on the right.

801
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,440
Okay? Or you could think of it as if I

802
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,680
give you some proofs of these

803
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,320
propositions, then this block will give

804
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,000
you uh a proof of a proposition on the

805
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,880
right. Okay? So, uh what's going on with

806
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,640
induction is we're given two of these

807
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,920
blocks, these two. So, you can think of

808
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,320
part one P of 0 is true as a block that

809
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,440
has no input. So, this is what we

810
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,200
normally call the base case. So it

811
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,599
doesn't need to assume anything and it

812
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,599
just produces for you a proof that P of

813
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,800
0 is true.

814
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,880
Okay. And the second part here, the

815
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,599
induction step

816
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,560
says that if you can prove P of N is

817
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,160
true and you plug it into the induction

818
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,800
step, then it will give you a proof that

819
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,800
P of N plus one is true. Saw a bunch of

820
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,839
examples of this last time. We assume P

821
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,040
of N and we use that to prove P of N

822
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,680
plus one. Okay. Now the cool thing about

823
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,200
blocks is you can just uh chain them

824
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,079
together.

825
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,720
So if we chain

826
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,480
uh the only block we can place first is

827
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,640
uh this base case because it doesn't

828
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,920
need anything to get started. So we

829
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,640
start with the base case argument that

830
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,880
produces P of zero. Now we plug this

831
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,760
into the step. This step has to work for

832
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,599
all n.

833
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,480
So in particular it works for n equals

834
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:31,440
z. And so we plug that into the step and

835
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:34,480
we get uh p of 1. We plug p of 1 into

836
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,359
the step. So n equals 1.

837
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,720
Then we get p of n plus one namely p of

838
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:44,480
two. And we plug that into the step and

839
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,680
we get p of three and so on.

840
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,680
Okay. Okay, so this just gives you some

841
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,280
intuition for if I can build an argument

842
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,240
for why P of 0 is true and I can build

843
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,480
an argument for why if P of N is true

844
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,400
then P of N plus one is also true then I

845
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,160
can just repeat that argument over and

846
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,079
over with different n increasing N by

847
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,160
one each time and I can use that to

848
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,000
prove that all the P of N's are true.

849
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,359
Okay, this is like visual intuition for

850
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,800
why why this works. Um, of course, we're

851
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,839
not going to actually prove P of N is

852
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,359
true for all N, but uh should be pretty

853
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:21,400
straight pretty intuitive from that.

854
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,400
Uh or more abstractly

855
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,119
you can actually think of induction

856
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,680
itself as one of these blocks. Uh let me

857
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,680
use another color.

858
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:44,560
So we have on the one hand uh a block

859
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,040
base which produces P of zero and we

860
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,920
have uh an induction step which given P

861
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,680
of N produces

862
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,680
uh P of N plus one.

863
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,760
So I'm going to think of this as a thing

864
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,440
that's true and this as a thing that's

865
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:07,040
true. And then what induction gives me?

866
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Induction is a block that given these

867
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,640
two facts, if you can prove each of

868
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:17,440
these things, then it gives me a new

869
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:22,400
fact which is uh for all natural numbers

870
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,480
n uh p of n is true.

871
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,119
Okay, so that's sort of the instead of

872
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,200
having to draw out this infinite length

873
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,040
path, induction just does it all at

874
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,960
once. It says, "Oh, I know I can chain

875
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,520
these all together forever. Therefore, P

876
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,240
of N is true for all N." Okay, I don't

877
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,920
know if that helps, but

878
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,079
it's another visual way of thinking

879
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,079
about induction.

880
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,240
Let's um

881
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,920
All right.

882
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,760
Let me tell you another uh equivalent

883
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,760
formulation of induction which I prefer.

884
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,440
starts out starts out the same. Suppose

885
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,640
P of 0 is true. Uh the second the

886
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,720
induction step I'm going to phrase

887
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,839
slightly differently almost the same.

888
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:30,359
For all n at least one

889
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,359
uh p of n minus one implies p of n.

890
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,520
Then

891
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,680
uh for all natural numbers

892
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,319
uh p of n.

893
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,720
So uh the first and last lines are the

894
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,240
same. We're assume P of 0 is true. We're

895
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,720
going to conclude P of N is true for all

896
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,040
natural numbers. Here we started at zero

897
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,839
and we wanted to show that P of N

898
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,920
implies P of N plus one. Over here we're

899
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,160
starting at one and we're proving that P

900
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,440
of N minus one implies P of N. These are

901
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,319
exactly the same things. I've just

902
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,960
shifted the indices by one. So these are

903
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:06,160
identical statements or equivalent

904
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,079
statements. Um I like this version in

905
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,920
particular. it will lead into strong

906
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,440
induction. But I like this version as a

907
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,599
computer scientist because I always want

908
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,720
to think about well I want to prove P of

909
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,560
N not P of N plus one. It's confusing to

910
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,480
think about proving P of N plus one. I

911
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,240
always want to prove P of N when N

912
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,400
equals zero. Okay, that's my base case.

913
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,720
I prove that specially when N is at

914
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,280
least one. I'm not in the base case and

915
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,359
I get to assume that P of N minus one is

916
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,520
true. You can think of this like a

917
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,640
computer program. Think of a proving p

918
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,440
of n is like running a computation f of

919
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,839
n or p of n and I get to recursively

920
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,599
call p of n minus one in order to

921
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,839
compute p of n. n is given to me. This

922
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,079
is the one I want to solve. If n is zero

923
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,160
then I solve it one way. If n is bigger

924
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,240
than zero or at least one then I

925
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,400
recursively call p of n minus one or

926
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,119
depend on that proof and use it to prove

927
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:01,359
p of n. Okay. But you can use either one

928
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,839
whichever is more comfortable to you.

929
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,079
uh but really you should use neither and

930
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,640
you should use this stronger form uh

931
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,800
called strong induction. So let's let's

932
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,800
do that.

933
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,880
Strong induction just gives you more to

934
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,880
work with.

935
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,240
So it's in some sense more powerful

936
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,359
logically it's identical to induction.

937
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,240
You can actually prove it using

938
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:48,079
induction and we'll do that. Uh let me

939
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:51,800
first state the theorem. So if

940
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,800
any natural number

941
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,839
this is true

942
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:10,079
then

943
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:13,280
uh any natural number p of n is true.

944
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,280
Okay. Uh let me bring this one down to

945
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,280
compare.

946
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,280
Uh

947
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,000
so uh first thing maybe to notice is

948
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,000
there doesn't seem to be a base case

949
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,079
here. uh which is a little weird. It's

950
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,040
just one condition then this let's

951
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,960
compare the steps first of all um so or

952
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,040
I guess let's let's think about the case

953
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,040
this has to be true for all n if we

954
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,200
think about when n equals 0 that's the

955
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:45,359
missing base case what this is actually

956
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:48,160
saying is p 0 up to p minus one implies

957
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:50,160
p of zero okay so this is kind of weird

958
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,800
notation I'm I'm abusing the dot dot dot

959
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,599
a little bit here and uh for when n

960
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,000
equals one this is p of 0 when n equals

961
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,920
2 this is p of 0 and p of 1 when n

962
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,280
equals 3 I mean for a larger n it's very

963
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,920
clear what this dot dot dot means but

964
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:08,960
when n equals 0 it's confusing so I need

965
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,839
to specify uh this is defined to be true

966
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,520
uh for n equals 0

967
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:17,680
okay so for n equals 0 what you have to

968
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,599
do is prove that true implies p of zero

969
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,839
in other words p of zero must be true in

970
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,400
all cases okay so there's Um, but then

971
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,240
for larger n, what this is saying is not

972
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,720
only do I get to assume p of n minus

973
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,720
one, but I get to assume all the p of

974
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:38,640
i's before p of n. So I would I would

975
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,400
normally say uh p of i is true for all i

976
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,400
less than n. This is what I get to

977
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,079
assume.

978
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,319
That's probably actually a better way to

979
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:50,720
state this this thing.

980
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,480
So with regular induction here, I got to

981
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,319
assume that the previous P of N minus

982
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,319
one was true and I needed to use that to

983
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,319
pro prove that P of N is true. But

984
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,160
actually if you look at this chain like

985
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,200
by the time I'm proving P of three, I've

986
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,800
already proved all the smaller PIs.

987
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,240
So why not and assume that with strong

988
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,119
induction I get to assume that in order

989
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,480
to prove P of N I get to assume all the

990
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,160
PI's where I is less than M. Okay. Now

991
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,000
when N equals Z, I don't get to assume

992
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,800
anything because there are no smaller

993
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,079
I's. Uh but when I get to P of five, I

994
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,280
get to assume P 0, P4, P 0, P1, P2, P3,

995
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:29,079
P4. Uh so I get to assume more. So this

996
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,079
only makes my proof easier.

997
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:38,240
Okay. Um to be clear, uh this is usually

998
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,400
proved in cases normally you need to uh

999
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,760
check zero specially. That might be a

1000
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,000
base case. Maybe you have to check one

1001
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,119
specially. It depends on your

1002
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,640
implication argument. this uh often this

1003
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,319
implication

1004
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,680
assumes that n is at least something and

1005
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,319
then you have to prove all the smaller

1006
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,079
ns to be true specially but we'll we'll

1007
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,720
get to examples in a moment. What I'd

1008
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,640
like to do first is actually prove that

1009
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,079
strong induction is true.

1010
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,599
This is not something you would repeat

1011
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,680
in your homework. You should just assume

1012
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:11,920
strong induction is true. But I think

1013
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:15,359
it's instructive to see why it's true

1014
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,280
as yet another example of induction.

1015
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,440
Okay, so we're going to use regular

1016
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,839
induction this version or actually I

1017
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,359
think this version the induction axiom

1018
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,680
uh to prove strong induction.

1019
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,480
Okay. Now, this is a situation where we

1020
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:35,240
need to define a particular induction

1021
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,240
hypothesis. This not the obvious one

1022
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:43,359
and this is not at all obvious, but I'm

1023
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:49,599
going to define uh IH of N to be uh this

1024
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:53,839
P of 0 and P of N minus one. In other

1025
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:56,000
words, uh for all I less than N, P of I.

1026
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,480
I like that better because it works even

1027
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,480
when n is zero because there are no i's

1028
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,359
less than zero. So that's just true when

1029
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,160
I when n is zero. Okay, so this is the

1030
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,400
thing I want to prove for all n.

1031
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:13,359
And how do we do it? Well, uh as usual

1032
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:17,680
with an induction, we have a base case.

1033
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:21,680
Base case is ih of zero.

1034
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,520
So uh ih of zero is actually literally

1035
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,960
just true.

1036
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,760
uh because we defined it to be that way.

1037
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,920
We said when n equals 0 this dot dot dot

1038
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,640
is true or you could say uh this is

1039
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,200
saying for all i less than zero where i

1040
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,359
is a natural number but there are no

1041
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,040
natural numbers less than zero. So this

1042
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,440
is like saying if false then something

1043
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,680
and that's just always true. So this is

1044
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,680
by definition

1045
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:53,280
uh ih of z is true. Great easy base case

1046
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,960
as usual. Uh what's the induction step

1047
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,520
look like? I'm going to I get to choose.

1048
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,480
I could either assume I of N minus one

1049
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:10,000
and prove IH of N or I'm going to assume

1050
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:12,480
I of N and uh prove uh IH of N + one. So

1051
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,760
we want to show if N plus1 assuming IH

1052
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,960
of N. Uh

1053
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,480
cool. So the key thing is we get to

1054
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,240
assume this is true. The strong

1055
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,839
induction says if this then this. So

1056
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,400
we're assuming the if part we're

1057
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:33,839
assuming that if uh this implication

1058
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:36,960
and this thing here is exactly IH of N,

1059
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:40,640
right? So this says IH of N implies P of

1060
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:45,440
N. So we know

1061
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:47,440
IH ofN implies P of N. That's uh what

1062
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,000
we're get to assume in our theorem

1063
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:53,520
statement here. and we just assumed that

1064
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,760
IH of N is true. Therefore, P of N is

1065
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,440
true.

1066
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,119
Okay, but P of N was not what we wanted

1067
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,200
to prove. We wanted to prove IH of N

1068
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,200
plus1. So, what is IH of N plus1?

1069
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:11,760
Uh let's just expand out this definition

1070
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:17,040
here. It is P of zero or dot dot dot or

1071
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:19,119
P of N minus one or P of N because I've

1072
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,800
incremented N by one. This no longer

1073
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,520
ends at P of N minus one. It now ends at

1074
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,440
P of N. Okay, but this is almost what we

1075
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,000
had before. This is the induction

1076
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:33,760
hypothesis of N. That's this part

1077
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,960
or P of N,

1078
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,160
right? That's just formula manipulation.

1079
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:43,440
And this we assumed is true. IH of N is

1080
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,839
true. And P ofN we just proved is true.

1081
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,680
Sorry. Uh I wrote or here but I meant

1082
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:51,280
and everywhere. This is and

1083
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,240
and

1084
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,480
see even professors get the V's and

1085
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,400
wedges upside down. So I wrote it

1086
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,319
correctly here. It's the and of P 0 up

1087
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,839
to PN minus one. Here we have the end of

1088
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:06,400
P 0 up to PN. And so this is IH of N

1089
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:09,599
which we assumed was true by induction.

1090
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,559
and P ofn which we just proved using one

1091
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,880
induction step. Therefore, the and is

1092
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,880
also true.

1093
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,079
And I believe that's the end of the

1094
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,920
proof,

1095
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,440
right? I did a base case, I did a step.

1096
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,960
Oh, no. Quite not quite the answer.

1097
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:32,359
Sorry, there's one more step here

1098
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,359
uh which I will put over here.

1099
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,960
It's a good illustration and not

1100
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,599
skipping steps. Uh what did we actually

1101
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:47,359
prove by induction? We proved induction

1102
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:50,240
hypothesis of n is true for all n. So by

1103
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:55,160
induction

1104
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,160
like the regular old induction axiom

1105
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:04,480
uh for all natural numbers n uh

1106
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:06,079
induction hypothesis of n is true

1107
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,359
induction hypothesis of n is this thing

1108
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,680
but that's not what we wanted to prove.

1109
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,599
We wanted to prove p of n is true for

1110
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,920
all all n. uh but I can do some

1111
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:20,599
manipulation to make that what I want.

1112
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,599
So this is like saying for all n

1113
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,319
uh

1114
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,680
let's see actually probably this is

1115
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:32,319
nicer for all natural numbers

1116
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:34,319
uh ih of n plus one is true okay this is

1117
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,920
a shift it's actually a weaker shift

1118
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,200
this includes ih of zero this

1119
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,680
should not be greater than equal to this

1120
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,000
should be an element of uh this includes

1121
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,119
zero this doesn't this starts at one and

1122
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,319
it goes upwards But this is nice. Uh

1123
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,079
this so this implies this, right? Uh

1124
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,280
this is what we've shown. This is a

1125
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,119
weaker statement because I just threw

1126
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,200
away I of zero. I of zero wasn't

1127
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:01,760
interesting anyway.

1128
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:04,640
I of one uh includes inside of it. So

1129
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:08,240
it's an and of a bunch of things. But

1130
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:11,599
then the last term is P of N.

1131
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,800
Right? That's if I take Ih of N + one,

1132
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:18,960
the last term in is P of N. So it's also

1133
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:22,319
anded but uh if the and is true then

1134
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,359
every term is true and so therefore p of

1135
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,520
n is true for all n. Okay, so this was a

1136
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,960
final clean up after we did induction.

1137
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,480
We didn't quite get the statement we

1138
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,079
wanted because we used a more gen a

1139
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,319
different induction hypothesis than just

1140
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:38,319
p. Uh and then we needed to show that

1141
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:40,559
that implied p of n for all n. Okay, but

1142
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:42,880
it works.

1143
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,599
Cool. So now uh there should be no

1144
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,640
question about why strong induction is

1145
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:52,240
true assuming you believe this proof. Um

1146
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:56,720
you can draw a diagram. Uh it's a little

1147
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:59,200
trickier to do. Maybe I will show you uh

1148
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,200
in my handwritten notes

1149
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,200
here.

1150
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,880
Here is a block diagram for strong

1151
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,960
induction.

1152
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,200
uh it's harder to draw because you

1153
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,440
depend on so many things when I apply

1154
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,880
the fourth step here when I want to

1155
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:22,079
conclude P of four I assume all the

1156
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:24,799
previous PS so P 0 P1 P2 P3 they all

1157
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,680
feed into this box in the beginning it's

1158
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:29,920
very similar I apply a step I get P of 0

1159
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:34,720
then I apply that P of 0 to a step I get

1160
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:37,119
P of one uh but then as I proceed I'm

1161
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,599
feeding more and more PI's into the step

1162
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,119
and it gives me one more pi. Okay, so

1163
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,079
it's a much more complicated diagram

1164
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,640
what's going on under the hood. But from

1165
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,880
a usage standpoint, it's it only helps

1166
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,559
you when you're trying to prove P of N.

1167
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,319
You don't just get to assume P of N

1168
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:57,200
minus one. You get to assume all the

1169
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:59,680
PI's uh where I is less than N.

1170
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,440
I forgot one part of the fourcolor

1171
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,240
theorem story which was when I was

1172
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,920
growing up I read a reprint of this

1173
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,839
article by Martin Gardner which turned

1174
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,960
out to be published on April fools but I

1175
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:14,319
didn't know it at the time uh and in at

1176
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,119
that in 1975 there was no proof of the

1177
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:19,839
fourcolor theorem Haken was I think one

1178
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:22,480
year later uh so at this point he

1179
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:24,319
published a joke saying in fact McGregor

1180
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,400
found this map which requires five

1181
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,720
colors I remember sitting trying to

1182
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,720
color it with with four colors and

1183
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,319
always failing. It's like, oh my gosh,

1184
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,680
fourcolor theorem isn't true. This is or

1185
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,160
fourcolor conjecture as it was called

1186
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,760
then isn't true. Isn't that amazing? But

1187
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,079
it was all a lie. In fact, you can

1188
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,440
fourcolor that map. Uh but it's is a

1189
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,839
very funny article. If you want to read

1190
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,160
it, it's in in the lecture notes or part

1191
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:49,440
of it is there all sorts of crazy things

1192
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,640
like oh it turns out if you take uh e

1193
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,680
and you raise it to pi time<unk> of 163,

1194
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,680
the result is an integer.

1195
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,240
It's not true. But, uh, all sorts of

1196
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:04,160
crazy things. Also, uh, chess has a

1197
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:09,359
crazy winning move. And anyway,

1198
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:14,400
uh, to relive the youth. All right. Um,

1199
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:17,040
I think I'd like to, uh, yeah, show you

1200
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,760
some examples of strong induction, but

1201
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,920
maybe first I should show you a template

1202
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,920
for applying induction. Strong

1203
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,920
induction.

1204
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,400
uh we'll repeat some of the things that

1205
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,280
I've said but I think it's good to have

1206
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:37,559
it concrete.

1207
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,559
So here is a template.

1208
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,559
Suppose you want to prove

1209
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:46,880
uh something is true for all natural

1210
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:50,240
numbers. So for all natural numbers n uh

1211
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,440
p of n is true. Then here's what the

1212
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:57,640
proof will look like.

1213
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,640
uh by proof by strong induction.

1214
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:09,200
Uh

1215
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:12,000
so generally we're assuming p of k uh

1216
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:17,119
for all k less than n

1217
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,640
and then we want to show p of n.

1218
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,799
Okay? Or you could shift the numbers by

1219
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,599
one but this is my preferred way of

1220
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,880
thinking about it. uh usually we prove

1221
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,400
this by cases

1222
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,160
which is the method we just saw. This is

1223
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,480
why we're pairing proof by cases with

1224
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,920
strong induction. How do we prove p of

1225
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,400
n? Well, it might depend. Often we have

1226
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,359
some base cases

1227
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,000
where n is small.

1228
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,799
So uh maybe we have to prove p of zero,

1229
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,960
maybe we have to prove p of one. Uh who

1230
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:52,960
knows? Let's say up to P of little B are

1231
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,839
the base cases. Maybe you have to prove

1232
00:59:52,960 --> 01:00:01,240
those specially for some reason.

1233
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:01,240
Okay. Then we do an induction step.

1234
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:10,480
So I'll say by cases here.

1235
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:12,799
Uh induction step. We get to assume

1236
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,440
n is bigger than b because we just prove

1237
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:18,079
zero up to b manually.

1238
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:22,000
uh and then we need to prove in those

1239
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:25,160
scenarios p of n is true because

1240
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,160
uh reasons.

1241
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,680
Okay. But the the big thing here is we

1242
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,920
get to assume in in these reasons uh we

1243
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:38,079
get to use

1244
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:43,880
uh p 0 p1

1245
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,880
up to p n minus one.

1246
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,000
Okay. So uh that's the big win. And in

1247
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,079
the base cases you don't I mean you also

1248
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,359
get to assume this but for example when

1249
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,720
you're proving P 0 you don't really get

1250
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:59,760
to assume anything because there are no

1251
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,760
smaller pis. Uh so often you have to do

1252
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,720
these specially because the induction

1253
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,720
step assumes somehow that n is bigger

1254
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,079
than zero.

1255
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,520
Sometimes you get lucky you just need

1256
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,079
the induction step but usually you need

1257
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:15,040
base cases. Let's see some examples and

1258
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:19,240
this will become much clearer.

1259
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,240
So let's play a game.

1260
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,040
called item stacking

1261
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,960
or it's really unstacking.

1262
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,680
So this is

1263
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,280
unstacking game.

1264
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,520
So, we're going to start with

1265
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:00,160
one stack

1266
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,119
of n

1267
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:07,480
and then a move

1268
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,480
uh splits

1269
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,960
uh

1270
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:15,559
stack

1271
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,559
of s bigger than one items.

1272
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,960
into

1273
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,960
two stacks

1274
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:28,599
with A items in one and B items in the

1275
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,599
other.

1276
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:35,680
And you get to choose these numbers A

1277
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:38,880
and B, but you need conservation. So A

1278
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:42,559
plus B has to equal S.

1279
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,880
And uh we also don't want zero height

1280
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,040
stack. So we need A at least one and B

1281
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,200
at least one. Okay. So you get to choose

1282
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,520
A and B however you want so long as

1283
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:56,520
there's at least one item in each stack.

1284
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,520
So let's take a physical example

1285
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,480
and got lots of blocks here, but I have

1286
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:06,240
no audience, so we're just going to demo

1287
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:08,880
this myself in in real life. Uh this is

1288
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,480
actually this was a snow day at MIT and

1289
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,559
so we're recording after the fact. So

1290
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,839
all the students MIT students have seen

1291
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:19,839
it. This is specially for you at OCW.

1292
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:22,319
Uh so when we do a move uh from S. So

1293
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,839
this is we have a stack of size S and we

1294
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:30,599
convert it into a stack of size A and a

1295
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:30,599
stack of size B. We get A time B points.

1296
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,880
That's just the definition of the game.

1297
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:40,319
A* B points. When you split into a stack

1298
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:42,319
of size A and a stack of size B. Uh so

1299
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:44,480
how should I maximize my score in this

1300
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:46,720
game? What's the best strategy? Uh the

1301
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,119
game ends when all your stacks have size

1302
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,039
one because you can't make a move on a

1303
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,839
stack of one item. It has to be greater

1304
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,280
than one items. So let's try here. I

1305
01:03:53,839 --> 01:04:00,240
have a stack of five blocks.

1306
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,640
And uh one thing maybe I'll try to split

1307
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,920
it roughly in the middle. So now here

1308
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,599
I'll rotate this so you can see the

1309
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,640
blocks a little bigger. Uh these are

1310
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,720
five blocks. uh I split like this. So

1311
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,880
that's a I group of two and a group of

1312
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,119
three. Product of two * three is six. I

1313
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,680
can do this level of arithmetic. So six

1314
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:21,039
is our total so far. When I split this

1315
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:23,200
one, I get one more point. That's seven.

1316
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:27,200
When I split this one, doesn't matter

1317
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:30,720
how I do it, I get uh 2 * 1. So that's

1318
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:34,079
two more points. That's nine. And when I

1319
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:37,359
split this group, I get one more point.

1320
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:40,880
That's 10. Okay. So one approach gives

1321
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:42,160
me 10 points. What if another natural

1322
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,520
strategy that was like splitting in the

1323
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,839
middle? Another natural strategy is I

1324
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,680
just take one off each time. So if I

1325
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:51,920
take one off here, I get four points. Uh

1326
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:55,839
if I take one more off, I get three more

1327
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:57,520
points. That's seven. 4 + 3 is seven. I

1328
01:04:55,839 --> 01:05:00,960
take one more off, I get two points,

1329
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,839
that's nine. I take one more off, that's

1330
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,440
one point, that's 10. Huh? 10 points

1331
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:07,200
that way, 10 points the other way as

1332
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,880
well. Maybe there's a theorem here.

1333
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,799
Maybe no matter what I do, I get 10

1334
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,880
points. Well, that won't be true. But

1335
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:15,200
for five blocks, I will always get 10

1336
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,720
points. For six blocks, I will always

1337
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:20,240
get, I don't know, 15, some more points.

1338
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,839
Uh, it turns out it doesn't matter what

1339
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,680
strategy you follow, you always get the

1340
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:27,119
same number of points for a given

1341
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:32,200
initial stack of size n.

1342
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,200
Let's prove that with strong induction.

1343
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,119
Okay. So theorem is

1344
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:47,440
for all natural numbers

1345
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,720
uh

1346
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,960
every strategy

1347
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:56,520
for this game.

1348
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,520
Uh starting

1349
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:06,760
uh with the stack one stack of n items

1350
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:19,400
scores

1351
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,400
magic formula is n * n minus one over 2.

1352
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:26,839
So that's the theorem and we're going to

1353
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,839
prove it by strong induction

1354
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,520
in sort of the straightforward way. So

1355
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,160
our induction hypothesis is going to be

1356
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,960
exactly the theorem statement uh for a

1357
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,559
particular n. So I'm going to highlight

1358
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,640
this

1359
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,680
statement everything except the

1360
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,680
quantifier and I'll call that p of n. So

1361
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,720
what I want to prove is for all natural

1362
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,920
numbers n P of N is true. And so that's

1363
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,280
that's just going to be our induction

1364
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,760
hypothesis. We're going to plug that

1365
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,319
into this template here. Assume that P

1366
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,559
of K is true for all K less than N and

1367
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:03,680
then prove P of N is true. So let's just

1368
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:06,400
try to do that.

1369
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,160
So what I would normally write here is

1370
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,160
assume

1371
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,720
true assume that my theorem is true.

1372
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:18,559
Assume P of N is true. uh sorry p of k

1373
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:23,400
is true for all k less than n. I would

1374
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,400
say assume true for all smaller n.

1375
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:36,640
Okay, let's uh we need to do something

1376
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,640
with the game. We start with a pile of

1377
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,400
size n. Let's just think about the first

1378
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,720
move.

1379
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,720
First move is something. It's takes our

1380
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,359
pile of size n and it splits it into

1381
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,240
some piles a and b.

1382
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:52,640
So uh we don't know what it is. We don't

1383
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,240
know what a and b are. But we can give

1384
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,720
them a name. Like this has to work no

1385
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,599
matter what a and b are. But let's say

1386
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,680
consider first move which we know we

1387
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:05,280
start with a pile of size n. And we

1388
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:09,359
produce piles of size a and b. And again

1389
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,920
uh a + b equals n and a and b are at

1390
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:15,559
least one. But otherwise we don't know

1391
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,559
what a and b are.

1392
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:42,159
Okay,

1393
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:45,359
so we go down to here. Um,

1394
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:47,600
so we now have a pile of size A and we

1395
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,440
have a pile of size B. Again, we don't

1396
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,679
know how big they are, but they are

1397
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,239
smaller than B. So I want to claim we

1398
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:57,679
are uh left

1399
01:08:54,239 --> 01:09:01,759
with two piles or we can really think of

1400
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:04,239
those as two completely separate games

1401
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,520
A and B. We're going to get some points

1402
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:07,120
from splitting up A. We're going to get

1403
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,679
some points from splitting up B. They

1404
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,880
sum together, but the these piles don't

1405
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:17,440
really interact from here on. We got uh

1406
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,880
we got A* B points from this first step.

1407
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,239
We're going to get some points from the

1408
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,319
pile of size A. We're going to get some

1409
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,560
points to the pile of size B. How many

1410
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,719
points do we get? Uh well, in fact, our

1411
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,480
induction hypothesis will tell us

1412
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:32,080
because

1413
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:35,279
uh A and B are strictly less than N.

1414
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:41,120
Why? Because

1415
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:44,120
uh a + b= n and a and b are at least

1416
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,120
one.

1417
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,319
So there's at least one in each of a and

1418
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:51,440
b. And so the remainder must be strictly

1419
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,880
less than n. If there's one in a, then

1420
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,640
there'll be n minus one in b. If there's

1421
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,840
two in a, there'll be n minus two in b.

1422
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,440
In all cases, less than n. Okay? Because

1423
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,880
a and b are less than n, they're not

1424
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,320
just they're not necessarily n minus

1425
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,960
one. So we couldn't just use regular

1426
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,080
induction. But we have they're less than

1427
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:12,239
n. And so by strong induction

1428
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:16,320
uh by strong induction

1429
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:19,640
we know that P of A is true and P of B

1430
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,640
is true.

1431
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,800
Okay, we wrote that up here. So P of K

1432
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:26,880
for all K less than N. So A and B are

1433
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,560
less than N. So P of A is true and P of

1434
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,840
B are is true. So that means from the

1435
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:41,080
pile of size a

1436
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:41,080
we get uh a * a minus1 / 2 points

1437
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:53,400
from the a pile. We get b * b minus one

1438
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:53,400
over two points from the b pile.

1439
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:01,480
And then of course we got a time b move

1440
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,480
points uh from the first move.

1441
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:10,640
And so now we just need to do some

1442
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,520
algebra and add up all these points.

1443
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:21,120
So the total number of points that we

1444
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:23,199
get is a * b + a * a -1 / 2 plus b * b -

1445
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,719
1 / 2

1446
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:27,199
These two were by induction. This was

1447
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:29,120
the first move. Uh, and now let's just

1448
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:34,159
put everything over two. So this is 2 *

1449
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:38,159
a * b plus I don't know a^ 2 - a + b ^ 2

1450
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:40,640
- b all over two.

1451
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:43,360
Okay. And now what do I want to get to?

1452
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:47,840
This is supposed to equal n * n minus

1453
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:50,320
one over two. And what was n? n was a

1454
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:53,280
plus b.

1455
01:11:50,320 --> 01:12:00,400
So, what I'd really like to show here is

1456
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:02,640
uh a + b * a + b minus one over two.

1457
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,960
That's my goal. And what I need to do is

1458
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,800
fill in the in between.

1459
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,920
Uh

1460
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:15,840
but this is not too hard because let's

1461
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:18,080
see. Uh I see a time b here and a * b

1462
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,239
here. I mean in fact you can just expand

1463
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,320
this out and you'll get exactly the same

1464
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,800
thing here. uh I think slightly more

1465
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:29,040
intuitive is to see oh look at this term

1466
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:36,080
this term and this term that is

1467
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:39,040
uh a^2 + 2 a b + b^ 2 that is a + b^ 2

1468
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:42,800
and then we have a minus a minus b over

1469
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:49,600
2 but interject a rule in between we

1470
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:50,880
have a + b^ 2 minus a + b over 2

1471
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,159
uh and then these two are the same

1472
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:56,640
thing. I think that's pretty clear. So

1473
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:58,159
cool. We did some algebra and the we

1474
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,400
just computed what we get out of

1475
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:02,560
induction and then boom, we get the

1476
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,080
answer n * n minus one over two and it

1477
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,239
works. How did we know this is the right

1478
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,480
answer? I mean, we were just told that

1479
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:10,320
by the theorem. Uh probably you would

1480
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,320
try this for very small n and make a

1481
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,159
conjecture. Oh, it seems like it's n * n

1482
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,080
minus one over two. Let's try to prove

1483
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:18,320
it. And when you assume the right thing,

1484
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:21,040
the proof just works. And it's kind of

1485
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,560
magical. And that's strong induction.

1486
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,199
Again, we needed strong induction here

1487
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,360
because we needed to assume uh what we

1488
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,679
wanted for all smaller n because we

1489
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:35,360
don't know what a and b are. This has to

1490
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:37,679
work for all a and b less than n. Um

1491
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:40,560
so luckily strong induction gives us

1492
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,440
that.

1493
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:47,679
All right, I have one more example to

1494
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:50,480
tell you about. Uh,

1495
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:52,480
a slightly more complicated version of

1496
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,560
the same thing. We're going to use

1497
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:57,560
strong induction. Don't need any of

1498
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,560
these.

1499
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,920
So, let's

1500
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,920
go.

1501
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,400
That's a problem called beat ordering.

1502
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,640
I guess somewhat relevant today because

1503
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,640
uh there's a Super Bowl, but this is

1504
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:20,159
just about

1505
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:23,600
any teams of games. Sorry, end teams in

1506
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:27,440
some game. And setup is that every two

1507
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:31,480
teams play a game

1508
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,480
and there are no ties.

1509
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:40,080
One team wins

1510
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:42,560
and the other loses.

1511
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,480
Okay, this is sort of like stranger

1512
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,760
friends and strangers uh where it's

1513
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,920
either one or the other. But in this

1514
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,840
case, it's asymmetric. It's not they're

1515
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,080
not both happy or both sad. One's happy

1516
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,080
and one is sad.

1517
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,520
Okay, this is what's called a roundroin

1518
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,040
tournament. Most sports are not played

1519
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,719
this way unless it's small number of

1520
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:01,280
teams because it's a lot of different

1521
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:04,719
teams. It's actually n * n + one over

1522
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:08,159
two teams uh games which is a lot. All

1523
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:12,159
right. So what we would like

1524
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,800
is what's called a beat ordering.

1525
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:19,199
Uh this is

1526
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:24,960
um an ordering of the teams

1527
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:28,199
t1 t2 up to tn

1528
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,199
such that

1529
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:37,199
b1 beat

1530
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:40,880
uh sorry t1 t for teams t1 beats t2 t2

1531
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:45,600
beat t3 and so on

1532
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:48,560
and a TN minus one beats TN.

1533
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,560
Okay, let's draw a little example. Uh

1534
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,520
there's team rock,

1535
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:56,159
team scissors,

1536
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,960
and team paper.

1537
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:01,600
Okay, paper beats rock, rock beats

1538
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,600
scissors, scissors beats paper. Okay,

1539
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,320
this is a possible outcome in a three

1540
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,560
team tournament. There's there's not

1541
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:11,040
necessarily one best team here. There is

1542
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,480
no best team. But maybe paper and rock

1543
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,440
play a game and it happens that paper

1544
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,199
won. Maybe rock plays against scissors

1545
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,320
and it happens rock one and scissors

1546
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,960
played against paper. It happens

1547
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:24,000
scissors one. Okay, you can tell why I

1548
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:27,760
named the teams this way. Uh then one

1549
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,280
way I could order these teams is paper,

1550
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,080
rock,

1551
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:34,320
scissors

1552
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,880
because paper beats rock, rock beats

1553
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:40,960
scissors. Okay, so this is sort of the

1554
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,719
input and this is my goal

1555
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,960
is to produce an ordering like this. But

1556
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,560
I need to do it for n teams not just for

1557
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:50,239
three.

1558
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:53,239
Okay. So let's uh do let's do strong

1559
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,239
induction

1560
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:02,280
to prove that uh the theorem is a bead

1561
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,280
ordering always exists.

1562
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,040
theorem.

1563
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:28,719
And when I say this always exists, what

1564
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:31,840
I really mean is uh for all n

1565
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:35,400
and then for all tournaments

1566
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,400
of size n

1567
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:44,320
uh there exists a beat order.

1568
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,000
Okay, there exists an ordering of the

1569
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,199
end team such the first one beat the

1570
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,159
second one, second one beat the third

1571
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:59,520
one and so on. I should say uh for all I

1572
01:17:52,159 --> 01:18:02,960
uh t i beat t i + one.

1573
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:07,719
Okay, so we claim this is true.

1574
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,719
Proof by strong induction.

1575
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:16,480
So we're going to assume that this

1576
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:21,280
statement is true. namely this statement

1577
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:25,080
uh is true for smaller n and then we're

1578
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,080
going to prove it for n.

1579
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:32,719
Okay. Uh let's

1580
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,640
pick a team

1581
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,120
any team

1582
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,280
call it t.

1583
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:42,080
Then I'm going to split everything with

1584
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:45,600
respect to t. So I'm going to define uh

1585
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:48,080
W to be the set of teams that win

1586
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:55,159
against T. So this is going to be a set

1587
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:55,159
of all teams S where S beat T.

1588
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:02,880
So this is one versus T. These teams win

1589
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,719
versus T or one versus T. And L is going

1590
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:08,400
to be the set of teams that lose against

1591
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:11,400
T. So this is the set of teams S where

1592
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,400
TBS.

1593
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:18,480
So this is a loss versus T. Then

1594
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,840
intuitively what we'd like to do is put

1595
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:23,679
the winners first, then put T, then put

1596
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,960
the losers.

1597
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:29,040
I claim that works. Okay. But how do I

1598
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,640
order the winners? How do I order the

1599
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:36,080
losers? Well, by induction.

1600
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:38,960
I claim uh the size of w this vertical

1601
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:43,600
bar means the size of the set is less

1602
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:46,480
than n and the size of l is less than n

1603
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,480
because

1604
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,960
uh

1605
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:55,360
uh the size of the winners plus the size

1606
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:59,280
of the losers plus one equals n. This is

1607
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:01,760
a one. Why? because every team is either

1608
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,920
T or they won against T or they lost

1609
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,159
against T. So this is counting all of

1610
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,520
the teams. There's T itself, the ones

1611
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,679
that win against T, the ones that lose

1612
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,719
against T. Together that ex is exactly

1613
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:15,600
N. Every team is exactly one of these

1614
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:17,199
categories. Uh and there's a plus one

1615
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,360
here.

1616
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:21,679
And all of these are non- negative.

1617
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,520
These here W and L might be zero, but

1618
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:27,679
there's this plus one. That means both W

1619
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:31,120
and L are strictly less than M. So the

1620
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:34,320
induction applies to them.

1621
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:36,400
So by induction

1622
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,360
uh this thing is true for any tournament

1623
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:42,080
of size W there exists a beat ordering

1624
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:46,400
of W. For every tournament of size L

1625
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:50,640
there exists a beat uh ordering of L. So

1626
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:53,440
we get a beat ordering

1627
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:57,360
let's we get two of them really. Uh

1628
01:20:53,440 --> 01:21:03,840
let's call it W1

1629
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:06,480
W2 dot dot dot W size of W. This is for

1630
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:13,360
this is an ordering of capital W. And we

1631
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:16,560
get L1 L2 dot dot dot L size of L

1632
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,880
as a beat ordering of capital L

1633
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,199
and then

1634
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:25,719
uh we concatenate.

1635
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:25,719
So we claim uh

1636
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:33,360
W1

1637
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:38,159
dot dot dot W size of W

1638
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:42,480
then T then L1

1639
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:46,199
dot dot dot L size of L

1640
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,199
is a beat ordering

1641
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,640
of all N teams.

1642
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,360
Again, this is all the teams. All the

1643
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:56,400
teams either won against T or they are T

1644
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:59,440
or they lost against T. And the idea is

1645
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:02,880
this part is beat. W1 beats W2. W2 beats

1646
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:05,440
W3 and so on by induction because this

1647
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:08,719
is a beat ordering of capital W. Over

1648
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:12,400
here, this is a beat ordering of of

1649
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:15,360
capital L. And so by induction, uh all

1650
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:19,040
these are are okay. L1 beat L2, L2 beat

1651
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:20,560
so on, dot dot dot beat L size of L. The

1652
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:23,280
only things we need to check are these

1653
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:28,639
two commas. We need to check that W sub

1654
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:31,679
big W, W subsize of W beats T and T beat

1655
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:35,440
L1. Why are those true? By our

1656
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:39,760
definition of W and L. Everything in W

1657
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:44,480
beat T. So this is by by the definition

1658
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:47,040
of W. We know that all of these beat T.

1659
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:49,360
So in particular, this one beat T. And

1660
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:52,320
we know by the definition

1661
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:54,560
of L,

1662
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,800
uh, all of these teams lost against T.

1663
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:00,639
In other words, T beats all of these

1664
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:02,400
teams. In particular, T beat L1. And so

1665
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,960
by combining all these beat statements

1666
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:07,440
together, we know that this entire thing

1667
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,440
is a beat ordering. each item beats the

1668
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:13,760
one right after it. So it's a little

1669
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,280
more complicated, but again, we're just

1670
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,600
quite often with strong induction

1671
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,199
proofs, you apply induction twice. You

1672
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,719
you have some problem of size n, you

1673
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,639
split it into two parts. In general, you

1674
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:24,800
might split it into many parts. Then you

1675
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,120
recursively solve the two parts or the

1676
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,360
many parts. As long as they're strictly

1677
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:32,080
smaller than n. By induction, we know

1678
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,520
they work out. By strong induction, we

1679
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,120
know they work out. You take those

1680
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,760
solutions and you combine them in some

1681
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:42,400
way. Here we concatenated with t in the

1682
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:43,840
middle. Um over here we summed them up.

1683
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,679
We summed up the number of points we got

1684
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:49,199
in each one plus the number of points we

1685
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,560
got in the first step. Uh and in general

1686
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:52,960
you combine them in some way and you

1687
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,960
prove that it's still that you're uh the

1688
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,800
thing you want to prove holds for size n

1689
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,400
and then you get your theorem. So that

1690
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:03,400
is the power of strong induction.

1691
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,400
Thanks.
