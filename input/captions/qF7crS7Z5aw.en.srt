1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,720
what I want to share is sort of the long

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,800
road that we've been on to get close to

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,080
a major effort on digital twins that I

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,400
think will take place in the future and

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,800
the real motivation I think of for

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,039
digital twins is in semiconductor

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,080
manufacturing is to create the platform

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,720
that will enable us to harness and apply

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,560
AI to improve semiconductor

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,199
manufacturing so I'll give you some

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,720
examples but I thought it would be

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,200
important first to sort of explain a

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,600
little what we mean by a digital twin

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,680
but before that you need to know and

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,200
remember the obvious what is the purpose

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,879
of semiconductor processing equipment

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,000
what is the purpose of semiconductor

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,680
manufacturing and that's

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,520
to transform some starting wafer into a

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,239
wafer with functional integrated

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,760
circuits on it right and so the way we

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,559
do this is processing through hundreds

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,159
of unit processes

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,640
that not only achieve that wafer State

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,560
change but also have to deal with

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,320
generating an environment around the

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,400
wafer uh controlling the equipment and

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,840
the Machine controlling and interacting

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,119
with the facility uh and to do all of

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,600
that in the face of enormous numbers of

31
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,520
uncontrollable uh parameters and

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,320
variations so the purpose is simply

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,759
achieving these wafer State changes so

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,799
the purpose of a semiconductor digital

35
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,439
twin is to better support that

36
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,560
manufacturing and all of the associated

37
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,799
tasks to make that happen so the

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,079
conceptual components of a digital twin

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,040
are first a representation of those

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,479
States like the wafer state that we're

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,200
trying to transform the plant the

42
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,880
equipment or facility what is the state

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,280
of the equipment and tools and what is

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,000
the state of the process the environment

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,920
or generating around the wafer to cause

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,080
that wafer State change a second key

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,760
component is models of the in in a

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,000
digital twin and these are models

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,599
especially about how those States evolve

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,879
or how we want them to evolve okay and

51
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,080
then finally those work together

52
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,239
together with

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,959
communication uh data exchange and

54
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,120
actions uh with the physical entity in

55
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,360
order to carry out many different kinds

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,280
of tasks so the twin and a key idea here

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,760
is the pairing of that physical entity

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,040
and the virtual

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,040
entity so what are some of the key tasks

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,599
I mean the the core task again is that

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,280
wafer State change but in order to

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,040
achieve that we hope a digital twin will

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,560
better support our tasks at the unit

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,519
process level for example rum by run or

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,599
realtime control support anomaly

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,120
detection fault detection and

67
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,959
classification recipe synthesis and

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,760
optimization and by the way you can

69
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,080
already see oh I'm going to need pretty

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,720
sophisticated models for that I'd really

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,640
like to have more intelligence in all of

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,319
these tasks I'd like to enable AI

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,200
assistance for all of these tasks

74
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,319
similarly there's tasks at the equipment

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,400
level predictive maintenance diagnosis

76
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,959
equipment design and of course at the

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,200
facility or full flow level like yield

78
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,599
Improvement yield prediction throughput

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,959
and scheduling optimization uh

80
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,840
optimizing the consumables for better

81
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,560
sustainability Fab layout and

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,360
design so where do we need digital twins

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,799
semiconductor manufacturing certainly in

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,000
the wafer Fab but the vision is a bit

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,000
larger we also need that in advanced

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,720
packaging that's rapidly transforming a

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
lot of the industry and of course

88
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,040
assembly and

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,040
test we also need digital twins for

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,120
Education and

91
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,280
Training right so not everybody has an

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,040
mit. Nano in their backyard we're

93
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,879
blessed with that and can use that

94
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,120
physical entity for Education and

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,359
Training but the workforce needs for

96
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,120
this larger semiconductor industry in

97
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,199
the future is going to need virtual

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,880
versions of that also in order to be

99
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,400
able to educate train and build the

100
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,280
skills of existing uh Workforce force

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,360
that we're going to need to transform

102
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,000
and bring into the semiconductor

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,000
domain so digital twins could have a

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
Major Impact I think it's fairly obvious

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,960
to think about operational uh

106
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,520
efficiencies but it's also potentially

107
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,880
transformative in

108
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,680
R&D that is again what we imagine is if

109
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,880
you have a digital twin with access to

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,880
data models representations and all of

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,400
the infrastructure to support that

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,880
that's a platform form for AI and

113
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,440
machine learning enabled tasks in both

114
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,720
manufacturing and

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,919
R&D and a key part of that vision is if

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,960
I've got virtual twins of Fab processes

117
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:19,560
that I've got say in an R&D Fab that

118
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,120
enables the translation and transfer of

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,080
that to scale

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,199
manufacturing not just by uh you know

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,600
transferring the the uh the the basic

122
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
recipe but also all of the models and

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,720
everything else that go with it in order

124
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
to make it

125
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,080
scalable so you might ask well why don't

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,039
we already have a full set of digital

127
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,199
semiconductor digital twins if they're

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,759
so valuable and it's interesting because

129
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,840
I think we've been kind of edging up to

130
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:55,520
this for at least 30 years or more in

131
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,280
fact at MIT we tried about 30 years ago

132
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,840
um we had a substantial DARPA funded

133
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,520
program on computer AED fabrication so

134
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,400
this was before the digital twin phrase

135
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,800
was around but the key ideas were very

136
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,080
very similar we were looking at building

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,160
some infrastructure to support computer

138
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,680
AED maybe not AI aided at the time

139
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,160
computer aided fabrication uh including

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,160
representation layers data access and

141
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,880
data representation sort of Standards to

142
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,199
enable a whole host of applic ations

143
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,880
scheduling at the plant level design

144
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,199
support fabrication support equipment

145
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,639
control uh and and so forth and so there

146
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,000
was a lot of really interesting ideas

147
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,080
from the time including language

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,160
representations of process flows so this

149
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,840
is a little example of a a a pfr process

150
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,080
flow representation for one little ramp

151
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,080
up step uh on on a

152
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,039
furnace what's fascinating to me now is

153
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,319
this a language

154
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,360
representation what do large language

155
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,479
models do they translate from one

156
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,199
representation to another they

157
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,879
manipulate and understand so I think

158
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:17,199
some of these ideas from 30 years ago

159
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,440
are going to be very important now with

160
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,680
the new technologies available to be

161
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,160
able to uh uh uh employ and harness some

162
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,000
of these AI Technologies so we had Cafe

163
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,759
30 35 years ago it was difficult ult

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,360
however to scale with the existing

165
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,199
technology uh of the time and what has

166
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,960
happened over the last 30 years is not

167
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,479
an integrated system an integrated

168
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,599
digital twin framework but instead many

169
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,360
many point Solutions each solution maybe

170
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,280
it's a runby run controller or maybe

171
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,840
it's a scheduling task each and every

172
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
one of these has its own data

173
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,919
representation its own models and

174
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,759
modeling methodology and its own sort of

175
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,000
customized for that specific spefic task

176
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,400
so there is still now today a lot of

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,039
these Point Solutions um but there's a

178
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
large cost in time that's required in

179
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,639
order to bring one of those in and

180
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,919
deploy them for each task and

181
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,720
application and indeed in many Fabs it's

182
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:25,360
only really worth it if it fixes a

183
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:28,800
crisis so uh that cost is large and

184
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,199
difficult uh we need to find ways to uh

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,000
improve that

186
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,039
so one of the aspects I'm going to share

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,959
with you is some of the the lessons that

188
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,959
I've learned along the way on working on

189
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,719
some of these kinds of Point Solutions

190
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,640
myself uh uh this is a bit of my journey

191
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,839
towards digital Twins and I'm not going

192
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,519
to go through Bullet by pullet here but

193
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,959
suffice it to say lots of interesting

194
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,760
projects with great students and

195
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,040
Industry collaborations on process

196
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,040
modeling process control and more

197
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,320
recently uh the employment of machine

198
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,959
learning methods uh to some of these

199
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,480
tasks but again I think we're at a

200
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,399
really interesting stage because the

201
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,680
technology enablers have advanced we've

202
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,160
got much better sensor and data ability

203
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,240
to access and store enormous amounts of

204
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,600
data that we didn't have 30 years ago of

205
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,600
course we've got much more powerful

206
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,839
compute

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,800
capability and of course we've got the

208
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,040
explosion the new modeling methods we're

209
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,440
in the age of Ai and machine

210
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,440
learning in order to get to employing

211
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,079
those uh new enablers we do need to make

212
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,560
it easier to develop digital twins to

213
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,800
deploy them to be able to interplay with

214
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,240
other digital Twins and these are going

215
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,600
to require looking back at those

216
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,279
components of a digital twin and

217
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,880
thinking carefully about shared

218
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,240
underlying software data system and

219
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:02,160
security uh infrastructure but also get

220
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,279
back to shared standards if you will on

221
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:09,440
what the data representations will be

222
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,360
and a apis or standard means to access

223
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,399
that data and to access and support

224
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,079
models and I think we're also going to

225
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:21,360
need some wisdom based on the experience

226
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,800
over the accumulated uh years and so

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,560
what I thought I'd do is give you some

228
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,800
insight on a few of the key lessons that

229
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,160
I've learned in working on precursors to

230
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,480
digital TN many of those uh uh Point

231
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,639
Solutions so here's the first lesson

232
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,880
models that we employ must adapt and

233
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,040
update and I think this is fairly

234
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,399
obvious if you think back to one of the

235
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,880
core Point

236
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,760
Solutions um often employed in

237
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,120
semiconductor manufacturing you have

238
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,760
controllers uh uh of the equipment

239
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,519
that's changing the state of the wafer

240
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,959
so for example here's some uh work we

241
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,000
did on a runby run controller for

242
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,680
chemical mechanical polishing CMP is

243
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,440
essentially you rub the surface of the

244
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,079
wafer against a uh polymeric polishing

245
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,079
pad it's sort of like high-tech sanding

246
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,519
uh wet sanding with a a slurry with

247
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,399
particles in it and you might imagine

248
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,519
and you'd be right that your intuition

249
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:26,800
about sanding like a a block of wood

250
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:29,040
apply so for example if I polish faster

251
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,800
the removal rate goes up or if I press

252
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,560
hard the removal rate goes up but at the

253
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,800
bottom here is a plot that shows over

254
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,560
350 Wafers that removal rate changes in

255
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,800
the equipment as the polishing pad and

256
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:50,160
other aspects of the equipment State uh

257
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,240
uh wear or change and so the solution is

258
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,440
simply a feedback control many of us are

259
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,680
Engineers right this sounds like a

260
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,519
control problem a feedback problem and

261
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,600
in fact model-based control and enables

262
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,399
you to have a model like that model in

263
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:09,000
the middle a very simple low order

264
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:12,160
polinomial model and if I can update

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,560
that model to track the state of the

266
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:20,480
tool then I know what the right pressure

267
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:23,680
and downforce and uh uh uh rotation rate

268
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,480
and so on should be in order to achieve

269
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,440
the goal right so with careful tracking

270
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,399
of the state

271
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,839
that is to say I've got a model that is

272
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,920
my digital twin of this part of the

273
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,240
equipment in process if that keeps

274
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,279
twinned and up to dat with the tool then

275
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,320
I can make the right the right

276
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,240
decisions by the way this this is a

277
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,720
little fun kind of Point here we often

278
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,880
think of neural network models as uh

279
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,040
something that I would do to model say

280
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,720
maybe that removal rate as a function of

281
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,199
the process conditions but also so

282
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,920
neural network or Ai and machine

283
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,480
learning models can also be helpful in

284
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,519
other aspects for example in that

285
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,399
feedback control I was just describing

286
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,399
we want to track the state of the

287
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
equipment but I got to be careful not to

288
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,240
adapt my model too much because then I

289
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,199
might be adapting to noise and in fact

290
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,480
there's an optimal set of weights for

291
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,000
how fast you update the model that

292
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,480
depend fundamentally on the rate of

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,720
drift or the

294
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,040
Noise Okay so so one could for example

295
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,680
and here's some work that uh that we did

296
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,199
to learn what the optimal weights

297
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,199
are we have a little neural network here

298
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,920
that learns what the optimal weights are

299
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,880
to use with a very simple almost linear

300
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,120
model fun

301
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:54,480
fact this is from paper 28 years ago so

302
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,320
we were doing a little bit of AI in

303
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,560
semiconductor manufacturing for a long

304
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,680
time

305
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,680
this same idea of model update applies

306
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:10,639
any place where you're building a model

307
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,079
that has uh empirical dependencies so

308
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,279
for example this is some work with

309
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,720
SanDisk on chip stack memory packaging

310
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,320
the basic idea is uh you get your supply

311
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,600
of chips each chip having about a

312
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,199
thousand e test parameters from a wafer

313
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,320
uh manufacturer and based on an e test

314
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,680
program you just pick out the known good

315
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,880
dies that you're going to want to stack

316
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,639
in four or eight or 16 chip stacks and

317
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,360
package the problem is that e test

318
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,720
program is not perfect there's actually

319
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,360
some lurking die that look like they're

320
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,120
going to be good but at the end of the

321
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,880
line when you Finly test the packaged

322
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,000
device some of those chip sacks don't

323
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:56,560
work and so the idea here would be can

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,160
we add a machine learning based

325
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,399
classifier that complements and sits on

326
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:06,519
top of the E test program to better

327
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:10,440
predict which D are going to survive at

328
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:13,560
the end so we did that uh using about

329
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,480
six or eight weeks of uh of of die data

330
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,680
you can build a really good model that

331
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,759
actually does improve improve the

332
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,240
yield however what we found out is that

333
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,639
model was only good for about a week two

334
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,360
weeks later it's not as accurate anymore

335
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:34,279
three weeks later it's almost not

336
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:37,519
helpful anymore so once again the lesson

337
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,880
there was that classifier decays so I

338
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,199
need a feedback loop I need an online

339
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,920
learning to keep track of the subtle

340
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,720
correlations that are happening that

341
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,680
cause D On's package to be good uh or or

342
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,480
bad so again the key this is just

343
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,240
showing a little bit of some of the

344
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,720
yield uh benefit um from this this kind

345
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,360
of an example

346
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,639
so the key lesson there is the core

347
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,800
digital twins idea of synchronization

348
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
between the physical and virtual entity

349
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,800
is really

350
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,199
important a second key lesson is

351
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,079
variability and uncertainty models are

352
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:23,120
crucial here's some work that we did to

353
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:25,000
model that CMP process again account for

354
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,160
variations that are inherent that are

355
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,600
caused by layout pattern density

356
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,560
variation and in fact if you run those

357
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,800
kinds of semiempirical models You can

358
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,720
predict what the surface Heights will be

359
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,839
and this is crucial for identifying

360
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,880
problem areas for example that little

361
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,480
lower right corner there is going to

362
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,639
poish

363
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,079
imperfectly so the methodology in this

364
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,160
case is not just physics-based models

365
00:16:53,079 --> 00:17:00,000
but in fact semi-empirical models that

366
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,519
you tune based on standard test vehicles

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,959
uh so one of our contributions here uh

368
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,760
is a the MIT semitech 854 mask set that

369
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,760
continues to be used uh to this day uh

370
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,319
to help characterize and and model CMP

371
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,919
processes and that semi-physical model

372
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,959
can be tuned to that specific process

373
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,319
and consumable set even if you don't

374
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,000
know and we still don't know to the day

375
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,400
to this day all of the nanoscale

376
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,720
physical dependencies in the that uh

377
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,840
occur in

378
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,520
CMP another great opportunity once you

379
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,120
have models that include variability is

380
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,760
you can employ branches of AI

381
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,679
methodologies including basian

382
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,280
optimization that I think you may hear a

383
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,160
little bit more about uh today um that

384
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,440
explore the space very

385
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,600
efficiently figuring out what the next

386
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,400
experiment should be to run in order to

387
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,039
both learn and uh uh get towards your

388
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,000
goal so here's a little example of work

389
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:08,880
we've uh done with Applied Materials to

390
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,600
try to speed up the ion implant tune

391
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,840
when you change to a new recipe or

392
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,200
remploy an old recipe after the

393
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,480
equipment has drifted and the basic idea

394
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,640
is

395
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,640
unfortunately uh things do change a

396
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,280
little bit the beam shape changes a

397
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,559
little bit with equipment aging and an

398
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,840
unadjusted implant profile across the

399
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:33,039
wafer is pretty non-uniform so what do

400
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,080
you do well the practice is you run a

401
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,679
few test Wafers make some measurements

402
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:42,080
tune up the equipment what we did here

403
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:45,600
was again use this basian optimization

404
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:50,600
to rapidly learn beam

405
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:54,240
shapes and accounting for uncertainty I

406
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,039
find what the next tuning run should be

407
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,320
such that with only typically one or two

408
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,440
tuning runs you get a very good uniform

409
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,520
profile so reducing from the sort of uh

410
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,320
standard operating procedure cutting the

411
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:13,400
number of uh tuning runs needed by half

412
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,440
or more so that lesson is digital twins

413
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,559
are going to need to address variation

414
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,440
and uncertainty uh uh quantification for

415
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,159
various

416
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,360
tasks uh the next lesson is pretty

417
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:29,679
intuitive standards and Frameworks are

418
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:33,520
hard uh um they are needed but they're

419
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,440
going to require a lot of uh thought uh

420
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,559
about what to standardize in order to

421
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,880
achieve the goals of interoperability

422
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,919
integration and so on and here one of

423
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,440
the early lessons and I'm actually

424
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,919
pointing back to the beginning here in

425
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,200
some of the cafe work is a conceptual

426
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,960
model or a conceptual framework where

427
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,520
what you really ought to be

428
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,960
standardizing on are the data

429
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,320
representations not on the

430
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,320
transformation models okay so the key

431
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,159
representations about those states that

432
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,080
the digital twin will need to represent

433
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,280
and then the models that tell how to

434
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,640
transform between those States and the

435
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,360
last lesson is sort of closely connected

436
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,480
to that

437
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,840
that we're going to need many many

438
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,760
different kinds of models to solve the

439
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,840
wide variety of tasks that we talked

440
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,559
about and a key point here is you're

441
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,960
never going to be able to standardize on

442
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:38,000
these models and in fact you want to

443
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:41,159
have a platform that will enable us to

444
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,120
explore all the way from abob nisho very

445
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,600
first principles numerically uh based

446
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,559
you know the partial differential

447
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,840
equation-based very compute intensive

448
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,240
kinds of models that capture a lot of

449
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,080
the physics to the full range of very

450
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,240
empirical functional models for example

451
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,799
that very simple polinomial model that

452
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,480
you can can use for runby run control of

453
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:07,799
CMP but there's lots of room in between

454
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,600
for all kinds of other models in

455
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,720
particular those that um uh are going to

456
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,240
be needed for twins or surrogate models

457
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,799
for some of the tasks that are AI based

458
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,960
so we're going to see a lot more neural

459
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,559
network kinds of models or physics

460
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,720
informed neural network kinds of models

461
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,880
that interplay uh with each other so the

462
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,279
road ahead I think is we're now getting

463
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,279
close to where we can actually

464
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:38,120
contemplate having full digital twins

465
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,200
Full flow digital twins sequences of all

466
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,600
of the twins for each of the unit

467
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,919
processes each of the unit Metrology

468
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,200
steps and to enable that you're going to

469
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,360
need shared standard data

470
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,279
representations support for that wide

471
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,480
range of models and the

472
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,120
interoperability to uh support a wide uh

473
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,799
range of different

474
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,080
tasks uh the road ahead I think is also

475
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,799
going to be very much enabled by uh

476
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,200
collaborations from the federal

477
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:12,600
government from state government and the

478
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,320
industry uh the road ahead will include

479
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,520
a brand new Chips manufacturing USA

480
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,559
Institute focused on these uh digital

481
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:25,600
Twins and just yesterday uh uh the U

482
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,240
announcement came from nist of that new

483
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,559
digital twins Institute it'll be managed

484
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,559
by the SRC uh and headquartered in North

485
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,440
Carolina and I think that's going to be

486
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,240
a very exciting platform and next step

487
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,679
we now have the underlying Technologies

488
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,360
to enable the digital twins capability

489
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,960
that were not previously possible great

490
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,960
exciting time and opportunity we can

491
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,120
learn from all of those Point Solutions

492
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
but the new manufacturing USA Institute

493
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,720
will help us build critical mass shared

494
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,039
Frameworks ecosystem Development Across

495
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,240
many of the players

496
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,760
and continue uh as R was talking about

497
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,080
uh Foster deeper industry and University

498
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,840
interactions in research and education

499
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,320
so I think digital twins are going to be

500
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,240
a great enabler for the future of the

501
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,240
semiconductor industry and going to be

502
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,799
kind of a bridge in a different way to

503
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,320
employing the AI technology not just

504
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,880
generating the AI technology uh for the

505
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,600
betterment and advancement uh and next

506
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,200
steps in the uh semiconductor industry

507
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,200
so thank you

508
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,159
uh thank you very much proper boning um

509
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,799
given we have uh only 10 minutes maybe

510
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:45,640
I'll be around yeah or you can have a

511
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:49,039
quick question quick answer um is

512
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,080
possible here po one question before I

513
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,799
take a break as someone at mmt on The

514
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,960
Cutting Edge of research in the area

515
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,360
what is your most Pro more provocative

516
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,320
vision of the future in digital twinning

517
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,360
if longstanding hurdles are overcome

518
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:08,000
what's beyond practical DTS well I I I

519
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,440
think one of the the visions that we

520
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,080
actually thought about exploring but

521
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:20,080
really wasn't possible decades ago

522
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,320
is truly flexible semiconductor

523
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,559
manufacturing okay right

524
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,200
now you get a pdk and it's a fixed

525
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,559
manufacturing process and that's

526
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,799
wonderful for enabling you know digital

527
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,799
integrated circuits that are are are

528
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,760
built using standard transistors right

529
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,120
but what if you had digital twins with

530
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,720
models of each of those individual unit

531
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,200
steps and ways and

532
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,679
intelligence be able to chain those

533
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,320
together in new ways those those steps

534
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,159
but with confidence that you think those

535
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,240
steps would actually work and

536
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,080
interplay that would be a a potential

537
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,080
GameChanger now you could start to

538
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,520
really customize all of your Fab

539
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,880
processes with confidence and who knows

540
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:10,399
what kind of new device product uh uh uh

541
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,880
system micro system ideas might might

542
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:15,640
come out of that so that's a big dream

543
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,799
but I think digital twins would

544
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,840
absolutely be necessary to achieve that

545
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,080
all right yeah thank you very much Prof

546
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:27,080
bony let's give a

547
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,080
PL um
