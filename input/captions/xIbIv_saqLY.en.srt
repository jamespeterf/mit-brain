1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,440
[Music]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,319
so hi everyone my name is Ora ashenberg

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,320
and I'm a computational biologist at the

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,120
Bro Institute in Cambridge Massachusetts

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,320
in the Eric and Wendy Schmid Center and

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,480
the claran cell Observatory and today

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
I'm going to lead you through the

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,520
introductory uh lectures that are going

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,279
to uh give you an overview of all the

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,320
materials you'll need to engage in this

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,840
data science Challenge and so the

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
introductory lectures are broken into

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,840
three biology technology and data uh in

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,519
the Biology lecture we're going to

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,280
discuss uh can and how it grows the

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,040
immune response to cancer in particular

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,120
te- cells and cancer immunotherapies

18
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,680
then in the second lecture on technology

19
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,760
we'll discuss uh how we can profile the

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,480
immune system and perturb it to get

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,120
outcomes that we'd like and then finally

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,760
uh in the third lecture we're going to

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,199
talk about the data that was generated

24
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,920
for this Challenge and how we can uh

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,719
load up that data play around with it

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,079
analyze it and this will get you going

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,680
for the actual

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,079
challenge okay so the first lecture of

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,600
biology is going to cover cancer te-

30
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,920
cells and cancer

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,040
immunotherapy so uh it's broken down

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,720
into four sections um the first will be

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,799
how cancer forms followed by our immune

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,680
system's response to cancer and then

35
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,600
we'll talk about tea cells in particular

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,159
and how they become exhausted and

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,960
finally uh we'll talk about cancer

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,240
immunotherapies so let's start by

39
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,079
talking about how cancer forms so cancer

40
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,840
is a disease that arises in our own

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,280
healthy cells and here as an example

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,560
we're looking at the cells in our skin

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,720
and these cells can transform and start

44
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,320
to grow uncontrollably and then spread

45
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,079
throughout the body in the process of

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,840
metastasis and you know if left

47
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,799
untreated this will lead to the death of

48
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,719
the individual so cancer is a disease

49
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,000
that arises within the genes within our

50
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,399
own cells and there are mutations that

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,200
happen uh that lead to the cancer and

52
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,560
these mutations commonly happen in

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,840
certain classes of genes DNA repair

54
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,439
genes tumor suppressor genes and Proto

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,360
Ana gen and as an example tumor

56
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,640
suppressor genes are genes that are

57
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,640
controlling uh how your cells are going

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,319
through the cell cycle and growing in a

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,679
regulated Manner and if you get a

60
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,720
mutation in one of these genes now the

61
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,200
cell is no longer really controlled and

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,560
how it's growing and it can start to

63
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,640
outgrow the tissue and that's one of the

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,200
sort of Hallmarks of cancer so uh these

65
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,000
mutations that happen in these genes uh

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,400
what they do is they actually change

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,440
gene expression programs in the cells so

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,519
gene expression programs are uh groups

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,360
of genes that are uh turned on or

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,040
expressed together and they function in

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,519
a shared biological process and so as an

72
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,959
example we can consider a melanite which

73
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,800
lives in your skin is a cell living in

74
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,440
your skin and normally it's going to

75
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,560
this gene expression program of

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,319
melanogenesis whereby the cells produce

77
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,720
melanin which is important in the

78
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,800
pigmentation of your skin uh hairs hair

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,000
and eyes and so uh when there's a

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,440
mutation in the melany uh this leads to

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
a transforming from a b benign melanoma

82
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,799
into a sort of an advanced melanoma and

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,080
as you get these sort of Transformations

84
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,560
you get these changes in the gene

85
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,120
expression programs of the malignant

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,159
cells and they start to acquire these

87
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,680
programs such as a program for cell

88
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,560
division so the cancer can keep growing

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
and growing and growing and also a

90
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,360
program uh in epithelium as enal

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
transition which is important for

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,840
metastasis and again these programs are

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,239
just groups of genes that the cancer

94
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,080
cell turns on to accomplish uh its

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,400
function so uh in the United States uh

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,120
we get about uh 2 million cancers that

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
were diagnosed in the past year and

98
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,879
cancer is overall globally the second

99
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,319
leading cause of death and so in the

100
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,840
United States the most common cancer

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,159
types are breast prostate and lung but

102
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,680
there's cancers that are kind of

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,080
occurring throughout different sites in

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,879
the body and then even within a cancer

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
type there are subtypes so you're

106
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,840
probably familiar with uh triple

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,879
negative breast cancer that's one

108
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,439
subtype of breast cancer and so uh

109
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,519
there's all these really diverse Cancers

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,799
and they're appearing throughout the

111
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,200
body and fortunately we have this

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,840
amazing protective mechanism in our

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,000
bodies which is the immune system and

114
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,720
this is really what's going to be

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,720
leading the fight against cancer

116
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,360
