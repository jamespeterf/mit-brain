1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,720
All right, good morning everybody.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,880
Welcome to the MPG primer. So glad to

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,800
see you here so early. Even though it's

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,719
disgusting and gloomy outside, it's

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,279
going to be bright and fun here today.

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,640
Um, it is my pleasure to introduce Kenny

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
Westerman who's going to be talking

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,680
about gene environment interactions, a

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,680
genomewide perspective.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
Dr. Westerman is a computational

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,240
scientist with interest in precision

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
lifestyle recommendations for the

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,960
prevention of cardiomatabolic diseases.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
He's an assistant professor at

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,360
Massachusetts General Hospital and

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,520
Harvard Medical School where he develops

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,280
methods and workflows to improve the

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
discovery and understanding of gene

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,520
environment interactions.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,680
His applied projects use these tools in

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
bioanks and cohort data sets to develop

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
molecular predictors of personalized

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,480
response to diet and other lifestyle

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,840
factors. Um, so please ask your

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
questions throughout. Again, the two

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,039
microphones are there. And thank you,

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,199
Kenny.

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,199
>> Thanks, Michelle.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,680
>> Uh, so yeah, good morning everybody. Uh,

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,520
thanks for coming here early earlyish in

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
the morning to come talk about gene

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
environment interactions. Uh, as

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
Michelle mentioned, definitely feel free

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,320
to interrupt. This can be super

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,119
informal. um as so if you have questions

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
as I go through uh just I guess raise

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,400
your hand or should people use the mics

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
presumably.

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,799
>> Great. Uh so I uh had the pleasure of

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
giving an MPG primer on gene environment

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
interactions maybe three years ago or

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,799
so. So I pro probably most of you are

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,439
non-over overlapping with that audience.

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119
So I'll give a some chunk of that will

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,200
be a similar type of introduction and

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,920
then I'll go in a different maybe

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
genomewide perspective as as per the

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
title rather than thinking about single

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,479
variant G bye discovery.

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,360
Uh so to start off just as a motivating

51
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,119
example uh actually first raise of hands

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,360
who who of you have done any gene

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,640
environment interaction analysis or are

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,640
are familiar with the the concept?

55
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,120
All right we have like half or so. So

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
that's that's good. So we'll start off

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,239
just to make sure everyone's on the on

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,640
the same page here. So phenyl keto is an

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,959
example uh of an inborn error of

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,560
metabolism particularly it has to do

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,640
with mutations in the phenol alanine

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,920
hydroxilase gene that convert phenol

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,480
alanine amino acid to tyrrosine. Uh and

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,959
in uh in the presence of this mutation

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,040
this buildup of phenol alanine can lead

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,920
to intellectual disability and

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,120
developmental problems early in life. Um

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,640
this manifests though as a gene diet

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,440
interaction or a gene environment

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,480
interaction in some senses because uh

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,640
the effect of a low phenol alanine diet

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,959
or the effect of this genetic mutation

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,360
only matter when two things are present.

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
You need both the mutation and the

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
presence of a standard not low phenol

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
alanine diet. And the fact that the

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,840
these two effects of the diet and the

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,440
genotype are dependent on each other is

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,760
kind of what we mean by the gene

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
environment interaction here and these

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
can be important. This is part of

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,959
newborn screening panels etc.

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,120
Uh so to broaden that perspective let me

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,480
just get my mouse out here. Uh to

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
broaden that perspective we can think

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,560
about a gene environment interaction

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,879
from one of two perspectives. uh one is

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
a genotype ccentric perspective where

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,400
we're thinking about the effect of a

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
genotype like we typically are maybe

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,239
more often at the broad uh what is the

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
effect of a genotype and then we're

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
adding in the exposure by saying how

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
does that effect change depending on

95
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,080
what the exposure level is uh likewise

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
we can think of it from an exposure

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,319
centric perspective what is the effect

98
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,799
of an exposure um and does it depend on

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,799
some genotype usually when we test these

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,640
in practice these questions

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,799
statistically will be an identical

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,280
questions in terms of finding an effect

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,280
size or a p value but nonetheless it

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,040
might change how we think about it

105
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,000
depending on which which of these is

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,439
your angle. Uh so and then one more way

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
to visualize this just to drive this

108
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,879
home

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
in the left panel here we see that there

110
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,360
are two genotypes here on the x- axis

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
and uh two environments are the

112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
different colors and we can see that

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,880
there's an effect in the left panel of

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
both genotype and environment but

115
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
there's no interaction because these

116
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,400
lines are parallel but the moment these

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,400
lines become not parallel that's what

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,560
we're looking to detect often in tests

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
of gene environment interaction uh where

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,040
the slope of one depends on the value of

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,360
the

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
uh and this shows up in real data as

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
well. So this was a a study from 2022

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
looking at the UK bio bank and

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,600
interested in interactions with

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,080
polygenic scores. Uh so the x-axis here

127
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,240
is a polygenic score for body mass index

128
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
and the prevalence of obesity is on the

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,880
y- axis and you see here there's an

130
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,000
effect of the polygenic score on obesity

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
perhaps not surprising u but there is no

132
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
impact of what they used as sort of a

133
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,160
negative control exposure left to

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,080
right-handedness as you might expect

135
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,840
that genetic effect is similar and

136
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,280
handedness has no impact on obesity

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,120
we can also have an environmental

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
exposure this is diet related exposure

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
that has some impact but is not

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,360
interacting. So you know obesity tends

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,440
to be higher for people who tend to have

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
high rather than low beef intake in this

143
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,479
example. But again no interaction

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,080
because even though these aren't

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,919
straight lines they are not in a sense

146
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,479
parallel. I mean they are in a sense

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,400
parallel. Uh and then finally they they

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,479
show things like here walk pace where

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,440
you see that here not only are there

150
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,240
effects of the polygenic score and uh

151
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,840
walking pace but also the slopes of

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,960
these two lines are different such that

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,800
the genetic effect actually depends on

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,880
um the uh people who typically walk more

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
slowly or more briskly this type of

156
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,600
thing.

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,039
So other common concepts in genetics

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,919
that we often talk about without

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,840
referencing G bye are or can represent G

160
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,000
bye. So we'll often make reference to

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,600
variable penetrance of genetic effects.

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
Of course this can depend on a lot of

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,240
factors. It could be other genetic

164
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,080
impacts. It could be a number of things

165
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
but one of them would be environmental

166
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
factors that are changing whether a

167
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,600
genotype is expressed as a notable

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
disease. Uh we also think about

169
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,440
stratifying genetic effects. So maybe

170
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
you conduct a genomide association study

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,039
and then you conduct two more uh

172
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,280
separately in males and females. If you

173
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,199
are then following that up by looking to

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,479
see how these effect sizes are different

175
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
that would be an example of G bye angle.

176
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,240
And then finally pharmaccogenetics. If

177
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,000
you expand your idea of an environment

178
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,199
to potentially include pharmaceutical

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,479
drugs, um the very the fact that a drug

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
response might be different across

181
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,120
genotypes is yet another example of a

182
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,600
kind of G bye.

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,600
Uh so why do we care about finding these

184
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,039
in the first place? Uh first is that if

185
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,960
you find that you might better

186
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,639
understand biology. Uh you might think

187
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
you understand the function of a genetic

188
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,840
variant and then if a certain

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,319
environment turns that effect on or

190
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,639
turns it off, you might understand that

191
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,400
better. Uh we also have uh from the

192
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,520
genotype perspective, we're interested

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
in genetic effects. Knowing that that

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,680
effect changes by environment could be

195
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,680
quite helpful in uh explaining missing

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,120
heritability uh or it might help you

197
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,800
improve the detection of genetic

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,080
associations if you can model that

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
genetic effect more appropriately. And

200
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,720
then from an exposure centrics

201
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,639
perspective, this is more of the

202
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,560
precision medicine angle that says I

203
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,039
have an intervention. It's a behavior, a

204
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,120
lifestyle, a drug and I want to be able

205
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,960
to better predict how a specific

206
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,479
individual is going to respond

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,160
differently than just the mean of the

208
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,840
whole population.

209
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,280
Uh and that again that would be this

210
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,000
exposure centric perspective.

211
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,560
So how do we test for these then from a

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,120
sort of statistical or analytical sense?

213
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,800
Um in a standard G-W was which some of

214
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
many of you are probably familiar with

215
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,960
we're thinking about some you have some

216
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,360
outcome it could be binary continuous

217
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,599
this could be a fairly generalizable uh

218
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,919
approach uh and we'll essentially have

219
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,919
some effect of a genotype term which you

220
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,840
can test variants one by one across the

221
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,120
whole genome and then we add any number

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,960
of coariants that you might be

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,879
interested in and ultimately we're

224
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
scanning across the genome estimating

225
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,720
and testing the significance of that

226
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,720
beta G uh marginal effect term.

227
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
So in G bye we essentially take that

228
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
same model and we're going to add two

229
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,319
terms. One is the main effect of an

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,840
environment that you could soak that up

231
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
into the coariantss. Uh and then the the

232
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,800
other the most important one is this

233
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,959
product term where we have a product

234
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,200
between the same genetic variant and the

235
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,279
exposure. And then ultimately we're

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
typically going to be looking for the

237
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,360
beta G bye in terms of estimating and

238
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,680
testing uh for these models.

239
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,040
So going back to the reasons that we're

240
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,480
doing this in the first place, if we're

241
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
trying to understand biology better,

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,240
often it's going to be this G bye term.

243
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,519
You know, if we understand this and we

244
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,519
see that interaction, that's going to

245
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,200
help us understand um the ways that the

246
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
genetic and exposure effects are

247
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,480
modifying each other teach us about

248
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
biology.

249
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,640
From a genotype perspective, we're

250
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,399
thinking kind of together of what the

251
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,880
genetic main effect and the inter

252
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
interaction are effect. For example, if

253
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,760
we're trying to map genetic variance and

254
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
say we're still just trying to find LOSI

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,920
for the interesting trait, but we want

256
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,839
to do so in a more powerful way, it

257
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,600
might in some cases be more powerful to

258
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,640
think about both the genetic main effect

259
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,560
beta G and beta G by E together. Uh and

260
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
then likewise from an exposure centric

261
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,360
perspective, although there are fewer

262
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,200
statistical tests that jointly test

263
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,519
these two things together, nonetheless

264
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,600
often we want to be thinking about

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,959
exposure effects in a model like this in

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,720
a way that says, okay, what's the

267
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,680
standard effect of the exposure and then

268
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,480
how is that modified by genotypes?

269
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,440
Uh we often define environment kind of

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
broadly in the G bye world. Uh there's a

271
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
lot of different terminology that's

272
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,279
thrown around. Some people like

273
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,279
specifically to use gene coariant

274
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,760
interactions because of the fact that

275
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,920
environments can imply specific things.

276
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
Uh but often some version of this

277
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,519
whether we call it gene environment,

278
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,360
gene coariant etc. We could be looking

279
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
at anything from a sort of proper

280
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,079
environmental variable pollution social

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,959
factors uh to lifestyle behavioral kind

282
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,760
of variables, demographic variables and

283
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,120
even physiological traits like BMI. This

284
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,760
can be a little bit of a tricky one

285
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,880
because you can imagine using BMI both

286
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,720
as an outcome as it often is uh as the

287
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,320
actual health trait of interest, but you

288
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,240
can also imagine uh BMI modifying the

289
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,240
the relationship between genetics and

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,360
some outcome traits. Uh so that's that's

291
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,360
one to just pay attention to.

292
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,200
So in terms of challenges, we won't uh

293
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,959
talk about addressing all of these here,

294
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,760
but just to kind of get your mind going

295
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,120
as to why even though there's a strong

296
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,920
motivation for why we might be

297
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,079
interested in GIE, um there are some

298
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,600
challenges that are faced in in that we

299
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,519
have to get over in order to analyze

300
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
these. One is that there's a even larger

301
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,279
space for exploration than for typical

302
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
genetic effects. So it's not just

303
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,040
genomewide genetic variance. Not just

304
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,880
the fact that we could explore any

305
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,440
number of outcomes as we might in G-W

306
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,959
was but we also have an you know

307
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,839
depending on how you define it almost

308
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,560
infinite number of exposures uh that you

309
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,720
might be interested in testing uh in

310
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,800
practice if you you know look at these

311
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,920
numbers in the UK bio bank for example

312
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,079
you might have a thousand plus exposures

313
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,760
that are sort of meaningfully distinct

314
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,120
in some way and might be interesting to

315
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,959
test. So that really raises your

316
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
dimensionality your multiple hypothesis

317
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,600
testing etc.

318
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,600
Uh there is also added statistical and

319
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,360
computational complexity in modeling. We

320
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
won't talk much about that today, but

321
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
there are all sorts of additional

322
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,079
considerations that uh you don't

323
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,480
necessarily have to think about for

324
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,079
standard genetic tests that become

325
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
relevant. I'm just listing a couple

326
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,600
here. Do we want to use robust standard

327
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,600
errors? Do we center the exposures? And

328
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
if so, how does that change the

329
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,480
interpretation of the different

330
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,959
estimates from this model?

331
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,920
Uh there is a big question of how much G

332
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,680
bye signal there is to find in general.

333
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,120
I think that's one you know that's

334
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,440
motivating because G bye tests can tend

335
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
to be lower in power. Uh we think okay

336
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,240
well is it a problem of just needing to

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,920
increase and increase the sample size or

338
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,000
you know do we at some point say well

339
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,760
there's nothing to find here etc. So

340
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
getting a handle on how much signal

341
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,680
there is in general how much impact it

342
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,240
could have if methods and data sets

343
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,000
improve is an important question.

344
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,639
And then finally, there are some of my

345
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,079
favorite uh G bye discussions are almost

346
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,240
more philosophical. They're the

347
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,480
questions like when is a G bye real.

348
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,279
I'll touch on this like a little bit at

349
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,079
the end, but uh when you the more you

350
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,600
think about the mechanisms that lead to

351
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,760
uh this interaction or this effect

352
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,720
modification. Some of them you might

353
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,040
learn to be able to explain it by

354
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,880
certain nonlinear relationships between

355
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,320
variables, sealing and threshold

356
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,040
effects, this kind of thing. And whether

357
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,000
those are explaining away your G bye or

358
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,440
simply explaining it kind of depends on

359
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,639
your goal and what what you're thinking

360
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,920
about with the analysis.

361
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,200
Uh so as I mentioned a couple years ago

362
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,440
I focused a Juba related primer on

363
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,360
single variant tests. Why are they lower

364
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,959
power often than genetic main effects

365
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,040
and what can we do to improve that

366
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,480
power? And this time I want to focus a

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,959
little bit more on this whole genome

368
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,040
kind of approach and the idea of what

369
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,480
variance is explained by G bye. How much

370
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,720
is it? How do we think about that

371
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,040
question?

372
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,680
Uh so specifically I'll we'll have kind

373
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,160
of three subsets to this uh talk related

374
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
to that. One is how we quantify the

375
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,920
genome G by contribution to complex

376
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
traits in general. Just how do we think

377
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,320
about doing that? Two would be well what

378
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,959
do we find? How much signal is there?

379
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,720
And then a third angle would be how do

380
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,360
polygenic scores tie into this story.

381
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,199
Uh so to tackle the first one here uh

382
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,600
some of you might be familiar with

383
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,199
variance components type methods. This

384
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,399
is a you know a class of statistical

385
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,639
methods where our goal is uh to estimate

386
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,639
basically based on some matrix of

387
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,760
similarity uh between a bunch of

388
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,240
individuals in a data set. uh how does

389
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,399
that type of similarity, whatever it is,

390
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,560
contribute to similarities in the actual

391
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,600
trait of interest. Uh in this case, when

392
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,760
we're looking at something like

393
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,760
heritability or genetics based

394
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,000
explanations based on genetic main

395
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,000
effects of how people are similar, uh

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
we'll often be constructing this matrix

397
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,440
as a genetic relationship matrix. So

398
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,600
basically, uh each box in this

399
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,000
relatedness matrix is saying how similar

400
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
are the genetics, genomewide genetics of

401
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,199
person one and person two. at each point

402
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,040
in that matrix. And then the statistical

403
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,639
sort of inference algorithm there will

404
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,360
ask is basically is this trait y more

405
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,600
similar in people who are more similar

406
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,040
in this matrix. Uh if it's entirely

407
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,279
noise then we'd estimate this

408
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,519
heritability or this h squ term as

409
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,399
approximately zero. And if genetics

410
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,399
perfectly determines the trait then

411
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,399
people will be similar exactly in

412
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
proportion to how similar their

413
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,680
genomewide genotypes are. and they'll

414
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,519
that will be detectable uh and we'll

415
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,880
estimate a sort of perfect let's say

416
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,240
100% heritability something like that.

417
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,320
So if we expand this model uh to include

418
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,000
two types of matrices now we can build

419
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,519
this out into something that allows us

420
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,639
to make a similar type of conclusion

421
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,480
about G bye. Uh so here we have this we

422
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,360
introduce this notion of the variance

423
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,760
explained in the presence of that same

424
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,839
main effect heritability type term. uh

425
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,680
we add an additional term for this uh

426
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
what we might call the g bye

427
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,920
heritability or I'll I'll refer to it

428
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,600
that way um and here essentially we're

429
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
asking the question when we estimate

430
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,680
this h squ the het here in this

431
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,199
particular paper they were using het for

432
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,519
heterogeneity

433
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,839
um and the question here is is the trait

434
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839
more similar in people whose genomewide

435
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,360
not their genotypes but their gby

436
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,360
product terms are more similar overall

437
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,519
uh conditional on this matrix of how

438
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,440
similar their their genotypes are in

439
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,040
general. Uh but ultimately we kind of

440
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,959
estimate these two things together and

441
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,839
we can get estimates of how much the G

442
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,920
bye contributes to heritability in the

443
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,199
same way that we can do for genetics uh

444
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,680
in a way that's much more standard.

445
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,120
Uh so definitely no need to memorize

446
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,560
this table here but just giving you an

447
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,880
idea that there are a whole bunch of

448
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,560
methods that people have produced in uh

449
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,079
especially the last 10 years but even

450
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,639
before that for thinking about

451
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,600
estimating these things. Um some of them

452
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,600
come from individual level data which

453
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,399
are going to allow maybe slightly more

454
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,240
precise uh and accurate estimates but

455
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,079
they are uh going to be a lot more

456
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,320
computationally intensive typically and

457
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,880
the G bye piece makes it even ratchets

458
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,120
up further the the computational

459
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,959
complexity of these uh and then we have

460
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,600
summary statistics based methods that

461
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,959
are kind of relatives of LD score

462
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,839
regression which some of you might have

463
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,839
heard of uh that you can con uh conduct

464
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,760
a variant by variant genomewide

465
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,360
interaction study and then perform some

466
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,360
imprints afterwards. Yeah,

467
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,559
>> oh yeah. Okay, [laughter] now I can feel

468
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
it. [snorts] Uh no actually I I know you

469
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,919
said that you were not going to talk

470
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,760
about you know some complex as aspects

471
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,440
of these gene environment interactions.

472
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,080
Uh it's just out of curiosity actually

473
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,400
for among these different tests if there

474
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,559
is some um some analysis on the scaling

475
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
of the exposure. So I know that you know

476
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,080
there could be and actually you were

477
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,919
showing this paper from the group of

478
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,720
andidal before and I know that there was

479
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,919
a poster in a in ASA a couple of weeks

480
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,160
ago where a person from his group was

481
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,320
actually saying that well you know

482
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
anything can be a gene by interaction we

483
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
just need to find the right scale for it

484
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,240
>> and so I'm just wondering if these

485
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,640
methods account for that to some extent

486
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,360
>> yeah so there are a couple things uh

487
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,960
related to that one is uh this is in the

488
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,720
category of those philosophical things

489
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,640
that I was talking about which I think

490
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,280
are kind of fun and frustrating to think

491
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,480
about. You know, if you can get rid of a

492
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,400
G bye by doing some complex

493
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,919
transformation, you know, have have you

494
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
invalidated

495
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,840
the G by is it still a G by is it still

496
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,919
useful etc. So those are kind of

497
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,640
interesting questions in general. Um in

498
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,400
terms of these specific methods, um one

499
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,640
of the very things that differs between

500
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,799
them are things like these assumptions.

501
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Um so you know and one of Andy's at

502
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,559
least one of these is from these

503
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,880
softwares are from Andy's group and you

504
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,400
know they're thinking about uh for

505
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
example something that gets a little bit

506
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,919
towards that is the heteroscadasticity

507
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,320
thing and so if you have a trait that uh

508
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
for which the environment is associating

509
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
with greater variance the higher the

510
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,120
environment gets of course in your trait

511
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,600
that'll relate slightly. Um, a lot of

512
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,840
these I don't know that they're dealing

513
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,840
explicitly with the transformation

514
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,880
itself in the method, but definitely

515
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,200
some of them like Andes are aware of

516
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,799
that issue and will show comparisons.

517
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,240
There'll be at least one slide in a

518
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,080
couple slides away that I have uh

519
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,919
there's a heritability estimate with and

520
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,160
without log transformation of BMI, for

521
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,039
example, and you can see they often they

522
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,200
don't change as much as I would expect,

523
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,200
but uh yeah. Yeah.

524
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
And so in addition to these variance

525
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,400
components methods, I wanted to just

526
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,240
briefly give a shout out to a couple of

527
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
other ways we can think about it. Even

528
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,080
though I won't talk much about these.

529
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,960
One is the idea uh I mentioned before

530
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,640
that things like a stratified analysis

531
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,000
uh if you are following them up by

532
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,880
comparing the two strata is in essence

533
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,640
an interaction test. Uh just maybe not

534
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,160
done formally.

535
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,240
Um but in and in that respect if you

536
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,440
have an exposure that is either in

537
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,600
discreet discrete buckets or binary then

538
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,159
we can for example calculate the

539
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,640
heritability in two different strata in

540
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,720
males and females compare them that will

541
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
get you at least an approximation of an

542
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,559
answer is the heritability different and

543
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,679
that you know that tells you something

544
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,919
about the genomewide uh contribution of

545
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,200
genetic variance to whatever trait

546
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,919
you're interested in. We could look at

547
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,799
genetic correlation uh which actually

548
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,720
this this kind of concept applies a lot

549
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
if we think about cross ancestry

550
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
portability of polygenic scores things

551
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,320
like that you know the question of

552
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,640
whether effect sizes for genetic

553
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
variants are different systematically

554
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,200
between different groups.

555
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,799
So those sort of stratified analyses are

556
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,039
one way we can also think about these

557
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,840
genomide contributions. Another is to

558
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,159
test polygenic scores for PGS bye. uh I

559
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,720
will talk substantially more about this

560
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,840
a little bit later.

561
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,080
So uh based on hopefully that gets some

562
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,159
idea of this question of how we think

563
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,480
about the G by contribution to variance.

564
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,640
So then what do we end up finding in

565
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,280
practice and so here are just a couple

566
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
for a couple of those software programs

567
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,840
uh that I mentioned in the in the last

568
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,440
slide or or algorithms I'm just listing

569
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,760
showing some results from their real

570
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,080
data analysis. Um, a lot of these

571
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,559
disclaimer end up being in UK bioank. So

572
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,840
we're a some of these inferences may be

573
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,960
limited to UK bioank but for example

574
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,840
here do I have a how about that? Um, so

575
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,280
to orient us for example okay one of

576
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,200
these papers from 2020 that was

577
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,880
introducing one that was introducing one

578
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,640
of these methods that happens to look at

579
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,039
many environments together. So we're

580
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,720
kind of combining the G bye contribution

581
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,600
not just genomewide but from multiple

582
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,960
environments. um to orient us.

583
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,960
Basically, we have two types of traits

584
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,120
here. The first three rows are our body

585
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,520
mass index. The last three rows are some

586
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,840
version of blood pressure. Uh and sort

587
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,559
of consistent with what we know, these

588
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,880
are showing standard sort of genetic

589
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,440
main effect heritabilities in the realm

590
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,200
of something like 25%.

591
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,200
Uh when we look at the G bye

592
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,720
contributions to heritability, these are

593
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,159
actually a little bit higher than we

594
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,960
maybe tend to find, but they were

595
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,280
reporting across multiple exposures

596
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,840
things in the realm of something like

597
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,880
10% additional variance explained beyond

598
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,720
that 25. Um so this is closer to the

599
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
upper bound of often what's reported.

600
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
Still substantially lower than genetic

601
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,280
main effects, but uh meaningful

602
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,720
contribution to the trade itself. Uh if

603
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,240
you look in the bottom left here, this

604
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,880
was another paper from a couple years

605
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,360
ago. Uh this monster LM, the names of

606
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,679
these are great. Uh this one is looking

607
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,120
at specifically wasted ratio as an

608
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,280
exposure. As I mentioned, these

609
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,919
atyposity traits can sometimes be used

610
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,200
as exposures, not just outcomes. Uh and

611
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,039
you see they're showing for a whole

612
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,240
bunch of different types of bloodbased

613
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,640
traits here. A lot of these red are the

614
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,320
G genetic heritabilities. These are

615
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,559
again in the realm kind of 20 30% 40% as

616
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,720
we might be familiar with for a lot of

617
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,039
complex trait heritabilities. Uh and

618
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,280
then the blue here are the interactions.

619
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,280
So a lot of them are significantly

620
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,640
nonzero but we're more in the realm of

621
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,159
something like 3% 5% etc. Um this was a

622
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,840
paper from just last year that was

623
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,400
looking specifically at smoking

624
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,480
interactions. uh and they had an an

625
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,720
interesting way although they did report

626
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
sort of raw heritabilities if you will

627
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,200
they also thought it would be

628
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,760
interesting to report a ratio of

629
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,080
variance explained by G by smoking

630
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,000
interactions for each of these outcomes

631
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,440
as a uh fraction of the overall variance

632
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
explained uh this sort of H squared in

633
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
general. So interestingly here when we

634
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,559
quantify it in that way uh you can see

635
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,919
that we're looking at

636
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,760
uh fairly small contributions to

637
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,520
variance explained relative to the

638
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,679
overall heritability. These are

639
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:25,120
something between I don't know you know

640
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:28,320
2% 5% 10% of the standard heritability

641
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,400
uh not of the overall trait variance.

642
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,360
Uh does that make sense that

643
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,360
distinction?

644
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Yeah,

645
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,080
>> that one. Yeah, we c we could talk about

646
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,000
that after. This is kind of an artifact

647
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,200
that sometimes shows up in some subset

648
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,240
of variance estimation traits, but uh

649
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,760
yes, it is it is odd. I agree, but we

650
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,880
can talk about that later. Yeah.

651
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,960
>> Oh, yeah.

652
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
um some of those measurements that are

653
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
might not be stable and they're only

654
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,640
measured once, you know, how do how do

655
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,960
they correct for that or try to deal

656
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,679
with that?

657
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,279
>> So, one way to answer this without

658
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,600
calling out any of these particular

659
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,720
papers. I truly have I'm I'm not

660
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,640
thinking about any of them in

661
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
particular. often these are genetics

662
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,000
people doing these studies and they

663
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,520
don't care that much about the exposure

664
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,679
because they're trying to introduce a

665
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,760
method not necessarily

666
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,760
uh you know find the definitive genetic

667
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,240
architecture of smoking interactions

668
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
whatever it might be. So um part of the

669
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,200
answer is they sometimes don't we'll

670
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,720
well you know do you this will be one

671
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,480
final part of the analysis in a paper

672
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
and they do sort of some cursory okay

673
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,600
this is how we're going to define

674
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,279
smoking go I'm guilty of doing this

675
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,679
myself for sure uh but I think what

676
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:49,120
you're pointing to is definitely right

677
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,720
and it is contributing to maybe why some

678
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,880
of these look like they're smaller

679
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,480
contributions to variance than there

680
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,559
might be in reality there are a couple

681
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,960
reasons for that but um The exposure

682
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,279
measurement is a huge one that I focused

683
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,200
a little more than the last time I gave

684
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,520
a primer on this, but it's it's a super

685
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,159
important thing. Essentially, in G bye

686
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,400
work, we have all the same

687
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,000
traditional epidemiology

688
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,360
limitations for these exposure

689
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,080
definitions, how we think about them,

690
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,080
whether there's reverse causation, etc.

691
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,679
on top of then the complexity of the

692
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,679
genetics and their the interaction

693
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,440
modeling. But so I they'll vary

694
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,080
obviously in how they process but that's

695
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,080
it's a great point.

696
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,679
Uh okay and this one sorry I wasn't able

697
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,600
to find a non grainy image and took too

698
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,279
long trying to find one but uh this was

699
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,360
one of the summary statistics based

700
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,480
papers and this this is another one that

701
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,480
did look at variance explained by G bye

702
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,279
in a way that aggregated over multiple

703
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,600
exposures. Um so you know whereas these

704
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,520
when we were looking for smoking again

705
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,000
uh something like 5% of an already you

706
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,480
know maybe 20 or 25%

707
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
heritability that's a pretty these are

708
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,440
pretty small numbers in this paper on

709
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,360
the right for example but that's only

710
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,919
one exposure. So we expect a little bit

711
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,159
higher contributions to variance when we

712
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,960
uh look at the sort of overall burden

713
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,400
over multiple exposures. Um here uh the

714
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,640
way they're being depicted is in the

715
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,640
blue are this narrow sort of narrow

716
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,480
sense uh main effect genetic

717
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,320
heritability and in the red are the

718
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,039
interaction contributions on top of

719
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,039
that. And then we can see for this paper

720
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,159
for example for type two diabetes these

721
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,799
six exposures together uh explained in

722
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,720
their estimation almost in this case

723
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,200
almost as much variability in the

724
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,880
interaction as the main effect. Most of

725
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,039
these the interaction is quite a bit

726
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,000
smaller but we're dealing with uh

727
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:50,159
contributions to variance of uh you know

728
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,120
things in the realm of maybe two 2% 4%

729
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,120
5% things like that.

730
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,440
Uh so one important caveat for all of

731
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
this as we're thinking about the

732
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,880
relative contribution of genetic main

733
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,559
effects and interaction effects is that

734
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,480
I titled it here interactions may

735
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,320
masquerade as genetic effects. Another

736
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,399
way to think about that is we've already

737
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,799
found a lot of the interactions without

738
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,200
knowing it by doing genetic main effect

739
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,600
tests. Um so this is some uh some

740
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,240
simulations that were done from a a 2016

741
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,080
paper. The idea was they again this is a

742
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,159
purely simulation. So we know the right

743
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,559
answer. Uh they they simulated some

744
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,039
exposure with a mean that's not zero

745
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,880
which is kind of a key nuance of this.

746
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,279
Uh but if you simulate some exposure and

747
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,240
then you simulate an outcome that has an

748
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,159
effect that's purely driven by G bye

749
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,000
there's no exposure main effect there's

750
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,399
no genetic effect independent of the

751
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,720
exposure it's just a G bye

752
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,880
and then uh depending on the riskil

753
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,720
frequency you sort of test genetic

754
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,720
variance then for uh kind of decomposing

755
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,120
how much variance is explained by G by V

756
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,960
and G by Even

757
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,600
though this again the ground truth is

758
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,919
that G by E is what this trait is

759
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,320
determined by. Uh the dark blue here is

760
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,880
the G bye. We're going to attribute very

761
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,399
very little. The model in practice is

762
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,320
going to attribute almost none of this

763
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,399
variance to G by E and it's going to

764
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,000
attribute most of it to G, some of it

765
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,640
depending on the risk frequency to E. Um

766
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,559
this can take a little bit to wrap one's

767
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,000
head around. I know it took me a long

768
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,799
time initially to sort of think through

769
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,440
some of this, but the main takeaway at

770
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:33,600
the moment is that

771
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,880
by being aware of this fact, we can kind

772
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,000
of acknowledge that some G bye effects

773
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,240
or effects that really are G bye in in

774
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,840
the sort of underlying truth of how

775
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,880
biology works or the data gener

776
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,799
generating mechanism will show up as

777
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,960
genetic main effects or they'll show up

778
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,880
in a way that

779
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,960
makes us underestimate how much

780
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,559
contribution G bye interactions in the

781
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,640
sort of causal truth have to uh the the

782
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,880
production of these traits. And this

783
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,000
does ultimately matter to try to step

784
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,760
towards disentangling this because uh

785
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,520
again it has implications for example in

786
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,919
a precision medicine context. How much

787
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,600
do you expect to be able to change

788
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,080
someone's genetic predisposition by

789
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,000
changing an environmental exposure? If

790
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,640
we have vastly underestimated we might

791
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,559
think that potential impact is tiny when

792
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,120
it might actually be quite quite large.

793
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
>> Yeah.

794
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,919
>> Is it true that thinking about the last

795
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,480
slide where you have the T2 and the

796
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,559
contribution of all exposures to gen uh

797
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,760
G bye expos right where you have

798
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,399
basically half and half for you know

799
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,320
just genetics and and G bye. Uh do you

800
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,320
think that if we have infinite sample

801
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,320
size and infinite exposures measures

802
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:50,080
that that would be all real?

803
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,240
>> Um I don't think it would be. I think it

804
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,200
there's some contribution that you just

805
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,480
expect to be largely genetic and there

806
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,679
are some arguments that I don't fully

807
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,279
understand to be honest uh that

808
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,240
arguments that nature or selection will

809
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,480
tend to want linearity.

810
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,480
I don't again I I will have to get back

811
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,159
to you or we can discuss this later in

812
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,919
terms of thinking about that question

813
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,320
but there are some sort of theoretical

814
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,240
arguments like that that suggest um that

815
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,080
there's going to be some basis where

816
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,960
just there will be some genetic effects

817
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,279
that are that are not going to be uh

818
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,080
fully modifiable but it's a good point

819
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,520
and it is the way the the seed that I'm

820
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,320
trying to plant and how we're thinking

821
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,640
you know that both um with better not

822
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,080
just more exposures but also better

823
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,480
measured exposures

824
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,640
that not only does the red bar go

825
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
higher, but maybe it even invades, if

826
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,679
we've measured it better, maybe it

827
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,080
invades a little of the blue space here,

828
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,080
that kind of thing.

829
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,080
>> Yeah.

830
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,000
>> Oh, sorry. So, I'm like here. Thanks.

831
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,679
>> So, about the gene bye part. So uh I'm

832
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,840
wondering did you further I don't know

833
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,880
classify the G bye facts about their I

834
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,919
don't know categories for example uh

835
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,919
most uh proportion of the G by effect

836
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:21,200
may be uh attributed to those um

837
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,399
genotypes that resid in I don't know

838
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,240
lower heritable genes compared to those

839
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,919
highly heritable genes I don't know

840
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,360
>> and by heritable there do you in um the

841
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,039
genes that are contributing to the main

842
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,039
effect the standard heritability.

843
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,880
>> Yeah. For example, probably for some

844
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,440
highly heritable genes is uh uh less

845
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,519
impossible to identify gene by effect

846
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,320
that could contribute to I don't know

847
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,880
variance explanation. But for those uh

848
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,679
genotype that resid in lower habitable

849
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,559
bore genes that may be more impossible

850
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,640
or highly probable to identify effects

851
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,399
for the target trait things like that.

852
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,320
>> So just confirming you're you're

853
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,240
invoking the idea that if there's a

854
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,000
genetic main effect at a gene level or a

855
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,640
variant level we're more likely to find

856
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,279
that that participates in a GE. Is that

857
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,240
what Yeah. Um that that is something

858
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,360
that we find. Um I'll have a kind of one

859
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,360
slide on it in a little bit, but yes, uh

860
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,840
that more tends to be the case rather

861
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,840
than not. Yeah.

862
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,559
Um okay so to sort of t summarize some

863
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,840
of this some of these empirical results

864
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,200
from these variance components

865
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,039
approaches um as some of you are

866
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,039
probably already familiar standard snip

867
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,440
heritabilities uh just genetic main

868
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,960
effect prediction are often very

869
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,720
consistently for complex traits in the

870
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,039
realm of something like 20 to 30 plus

871
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,720
percent for traits like anthropometric

872
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,000
things height easily more

873
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,159
straightforwardly measured highly

874
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,240
genetic they can reach greater than much

875
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,760
greater than 50% sometimes

876
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,600
um when we compare that to G by

877
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,080
heritabilities as currently measured

878
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,080
using currently methods current methods

879
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,159
etc. In terms of overall variance

880
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,840
explained we tend to be finding things

881
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,960
when they are significant in the realm

882
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,480
of something like 1 to 10% uh and also

883
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,320
another way of thinking about that would

884
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,480
be up to uh maybe 10% or so of standard

885
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,159
sniper heritability.

886
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,079
We also, as we've been discussing a

887
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,919
little bit, you might expect more signal

888
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,879
uh when combining G by contributions

889
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,560
from multiple exposures and we could uh

890
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,560
to the question from before, we could

891
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,480
imagine stacking more and more and

892
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,280
potentially accumulating additional

893
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,879
variants explained. Um so some caveats

894
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,560
to this. First, these upper limits are

895
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,079
not as hard as those for genetic main

896
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,839
effects. This is basically I won't spend

897
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,480
more time on this because we were just

898
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,919
uh discussing it but uh there is sort of

899
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,679
more hope for increasing this than with

900
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,359
just uh more targeted analysis than

901
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,040
improved methods might be expected to

902
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,760
incre increase something like a genetic

903
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,280
main effect heritability. Um true G by

904
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,560
effects might be disguised as a genetic

905
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,800
main effect. That's what we were just

906
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,720
talking about where uh maybe there are

907
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,240
true underlying G by effects that look

908
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,400
like their genetic main effects when we

909
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,320
do the actual analysis. Uh and then

910
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,520
finally just a reinforcement this is

911
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,119
true uh also in uh most genetics work

912
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,599
but variance explained is not the same

913
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,000
as biomedical value. Uh when there is

914
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,440
high variance explained it matters both

915
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,359
how strong the effects of genetic

916
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,599
variants are but also how prevalent they

917
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,920
are. We're thinking about evolution,

918
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,560
selection, uh, and the fact that, uh,

919
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,400
ability to intervene on something, uh,

920
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,400
might be different depending on the

921
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,560
biological mechanisms underlying any

922
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,880
given locus's action, that sort of

923
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,359
thing.

924
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,640
Uh, so then finally to wrap up this

925
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,240
final point here, what is the role of

926
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,839
polygenic scores? So when we're talking

927
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,440
about genomewide approaches, obviously

928
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,520
polygenic scores are something that come

929
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,720
to a lot of people's minds and they're

930
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,040
something that we've worked on a little

931
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,480
bit. So polygenic scores, just to make

932
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,280
sure everyone's on the same page, these

933
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,280
are maximizing signal by aggregating

934
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,200
across genetic variant effects

935
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,760
genomewide.

936
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,839
Um the concept here is that we could

937
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,000
imagine developing a polygenic score as

938
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:08,400
we otherwise might that's meant for

939
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,480
prediction but then test it for PGS by

940
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,720
environment interaction. And unlike a

941
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,960
variance component approaches, these can

942
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,400
these are valuable beyond those because

943
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,079
they don't just allow us to quantify

944
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,720
okay this is how much it matters but you

945
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,119
also get an individual level estimate of

946
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,079
what is this polygenic score and if that

947
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,240
predicts if that modifies the expected

948
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,320
response to an exposure and environment.

949
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,640
you could tell that individual here's

950
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,880
how much you know in in a personalized

951
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,119
way here's how much that your outcome is

952
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,119
expected to change upon modifying the

953
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,040
exposure.

954
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,119
Uh so a basic approach would be to

955
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,359
create a standard polygenic score test

956
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,000
it for interaction. Um this was a paper

957
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,480
from uh 2012 that made a little bit of a

958
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,400
splash and they were looking at these

959
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,000
different quartiles of a body mass index

960
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,079
polygenic score and these are then the

961
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,160
different colors. uh for example in the

962
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,160
nurse's health study on the the left set

963
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,200
of bars and what they're showing on the

964
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,359
y- axis axis is not BMI itself or not a

965
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,480
mean but rather the effect size of sugar

966
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,320
sweetened beverage intake on BMI and so

967
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,960
what they were seeing is that depending

968
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,560
the higher one's standard genetic

969
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,160
predisposition to higher BMI was the

970
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,839
greater impact a BMI increasing exposure

971
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,560
like sugar sweetened beverages had on

972
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,440
that outcome. Uh and so there was some

973
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,359
initial excitement from approaches like

974
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,960
this as to whether this could apply in a

975
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,200
lot of cases, whether polygenic scores

976
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,359
can just allow us to much more

977
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,240
powerfully and strongly detect G bye. Um

978
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,480
but not only does that not work as well

979
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,040
in many cases, but it's maybe

980
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,800
theoretically not the best way. If we're

981
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,599
trying to find a polygenic score that

982
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,440
interacts with an environment, we might

983
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,760
want to build that polygenic score in a

984
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,280
way that's slightly different if your

985
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,920
ultimate goal is interaction than if

986
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,839
your ultimate goal is prediction. Um, I

987
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,920
won't spend too much time on this here

988
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,520
just for overall time reasons, but this

989
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,760
was a a paper of ours recently that was

990
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,440
looking at if you

991
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,440
run different types of genomewide

992
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,040
studies, you can run a standard GWAS or

993
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,520
you can run an interaction focused G-W

994
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,560
was or a variance focused G-W was etc.

995
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,240
You have different types of betas that

996
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,839
you can aggregate over when building

997
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,760
your polygenic score. And these

998
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,599
different approaches might get you an

999
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,359
ultimate score that's more effective at

1000
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,359
detecting interruption, something like

1001
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,359
that.

1002
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,520
And so this is getting a little bit to

1003
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,119
the question from before which was uh

1004
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,119
the question was something like well you

1005
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,800
know are in genes or lossi that have

1006
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,760
main effects are we expecting to find

1007
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,240
interactions? Um, another way to put

1008
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,119
that here are are G byes likely to be

1009
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,720
found in novel LOSI or are they in

1010
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,640
established LOSI for the trait in

1011
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,880
question? Um, this was something that we

1012
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,359
at least poked into a little bit in our

1013
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,200
uh paper and at least in a preliminary

1014
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,547
sense, what we tended to find just as an

1015
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,040
overall takeaway was that

1016
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:12,880
[clears throat] often it seems like this

1017
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,880
genomewide signature of G bye is a is

1018
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,480
not distinct. we're not necessarily

1019
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,560
discovering new lossi that are

1020
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,960
interacting but it seems to be some

1021
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,520
targeted subset of the overall genetic

1022
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,240
architecture. Um so if you know if there

1023
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,560
are 20 lossi that affect here in this

1024
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,400
particular study that affect the liver

1025
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,720
stress biioarker alt um then maybe 10 of

1026
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,240
those are are particularly interesting

1027
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,440
for interaction with BMI. uh and that so

1028
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,640
a lot of these genomewide discovery of

1029
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,760
what LOSI are are participating

1030
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,680
interaction consists of you could

1031
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,119
conceive of that process as more like

1032
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,200
we're trying to find the right subset of

1033
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,200
the in this case alt genetic

1034
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,200
architecture

1035
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,640
um and then one final way we can think

1036
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,000
about uh increasing or adding

1037
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,599
sophistication to some of these

1038
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,839
polygenic scores for approaches if we

1039
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,760
want to creep back from a full only

1040
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,160
genomewide approach but get a little bit

1041
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,520
more mechanism involved. uh this was an

1042
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,280
approach that's been taken by a couple

1043
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,160
of studies but I'm I'm highlighting here

1044
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,720
from this Godderman 2025 paper uh where

1045
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,440
they started with a genomwide set of

1046
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,160
genomewide significant snips uh 204

1047
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,599
snips from a colorectile cancer GWAS and

1048
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,400
said instead of testing that for

1049
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,400
interaction we're going to test or in

1050
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,440
addition to testing that for interaction

1051
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,119
we're going to find a pathway database

1052
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,960
this panther pathway database that has

1053
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,760
lists of genes that belong to certain

1054
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,680
pathways um if you map the pathway to

1055
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,839
genes and then genes to a bunch of

1056
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,440
variants kind of physically near them in

1057
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,680
genomic position. Uh you can then create

1058
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,400
new polygenic scores from subsets of

1059
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,640
these 204 snips. Uh and then you create

1060
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,200
a whole bunch of those maybe it's 50 100

1061
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,200
plus test each of them for interaction

1062
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,200
and that might be a more powerful way

1063
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,680
and a more biologically specific way to

1064
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,599
find interactions. uh in this particular

1065
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,079
case uh they were able to find for

1066
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,319
example that in the blue line here uh

1067
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,599
this was one particular pathway specific

1068
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,079
polygenic score this related to TGF beta

1069
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,319
um pathway activity and they found that

1070
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,960
genetic variance in this pathway a sort

1071
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,319
of a polygenic score focused on that was

1072
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,920
able to associate with a steady decrease

1073
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,640
in the effect size of non non-steroidal

1074
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,960
and anti-inflammatory drug use on

1075
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,680
colorectal cancer risk

1076
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,359
uh in a sort of step-wise way, the

1077
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,400
higher this genetic predisposition.

1078
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,599
Again, the y-axis here is an effect, not

1079
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,440
a mean or a proportion. Um, and this was

1080
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,359
a stronger interaction, a stronger

1081
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,599
effect modification in blue in that

1082
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,720
pathway specific effect than the

1083
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:01,680
genomewide score was in green there.

1084
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,200
Uh, and I had a couple pieces of bonus

1085
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,880
material. I'll show one of them just for

1086
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,599
for time reasons. This was an

1087
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,200
interesting uh this is coming back then

1088
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,599
to what I mentioned about the little bit

1089
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,960
of philosophy uh that's that's involved

1090
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,440
here. So, uh, I was talking with a

1091
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,720
colleague a couple years ago, uh, and I

1092
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,280
think she made some provocative

1093
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,440
statements like, uh, do G byes really

1094
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,960
exist or something something of that

1095
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,240
nature. And as we were talking through

1096
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,319
this, it kind of a a review was born.

1097
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,520
Uh, and so we were kind of cataloging a

1098
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,599
series of what we ended up calling

1099
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,839
phenomena where, you know, what are sort

1100
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,520
of mechanisms that can lead to the

1101
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,599
ability to detect a statistical G bye.

1102
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,560
And this was one of just to give you a

1103
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,560
flavor of one of them here. If we have

1104
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,160
correlation between a gene and an

1105
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,440
environment or genetic variant in an

1106
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,599
environment shown here combined with

1107
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,359
nonlinearity and a relationship between

1108
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,079
that environment and some continuous

1109
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,440
risk factor or nonlinearity even kind of

1110
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,359
comes baked into binary outcomes. Um but

1111
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,720
you can see that this is sort of a a

1112
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,119
subtly nonstraight line here in this ey

1113
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,200
slope. um that can actually produce the

1114
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,200
appearance of a G bye where now we're

1115
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,319
saying if you actually now stratify by

1116
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,000
genotype and you look at the

1117
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,400
relationship between this simulated

1118
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,240
exposure and outcome these lines are

1119
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,640
subtly not parallel you could imagine

1120
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,880
more extreme versions of this um but

1121
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,200
this was one example of how okay if gene

1122
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,119
is correlated with environment and

1123
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,280
environment is nonlinearly correlated

1124
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:38,160
with the outcome we can detect G by is

1125
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,440
that is it a real

1126
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,040
you know, depending on how you're

1127
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,720
thinking about it and what you're trying

1128
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,440
to discover, it might be real. This

1129
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,040
might have the same level of medical

1130
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,880
implications

1131
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,079
as something else, but it might not

1132
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,079
teach us about the effect of this

1133
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,000
genetic variant as much as we thought.

1134
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,319
So, this is kind of just getting your

1135
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,920
mind jogged about that that issue a

1136
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,599
little bit. I'm

1137
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,040
>> going to skip this here for time and

1138
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,640
just summarize. Uh so G by E analysis uh

1139
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,119
as I've mentioned can be a critical

1140
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,880
building block for not just biological

1141
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,400
understanding when we're trying to just

1142
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,319
nail down where are these interactions

1143
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
and what are the lossi uh but also

1144
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,839
informing personalized medicine if we

1145
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,200
take a sort of overall genetic

1146
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,200
prediction of how someone is going to

1147
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,560
respond to an environment. Um, these

1148
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,920
genomewide approaches that I've been

1149
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,240
talking about can allow us to both

1150
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,480
understand where there is locus or

1151
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,079
pathway specific signal to pursue, what

1152
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
environments are more interesting than

1153
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,520
others because they explain more

1154
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,160
variance. This is a good place to start

1155
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,560
to look to improve exposure definitions

1156
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,480
etc. Um, they also allow us to maximize

1157
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,319
power to detect this heterogeneity in

1158
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,160
the exposure outcome relationship in the

1159
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,240
same way that polygenic scores and

1160
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,880
genomwide approaches do for genetic main

1161
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,119
effects. Um, progress continues to be

1162
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,560
made. uh I'm trying to do my part in

1163
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,560
contributing to it, but a lot of people

1164
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,240
are are working on things like GIE

1165
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,800
specific polygenic scores, pathway

1166
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,280
specific approaches uh and creative

1167
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,040
approaches to exposure definition. So

1168
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,760
happy to talk through any more of this.

1169
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,760
Uh thanks for your attention.

1170
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,640
>> Thank you. Questions? Great.

1171
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,200
>> Thanks for the beautiful talk. Yeah. On

1172
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,480
this philosophical stuff, I mean, it

1173
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,079
seems like like you know the old adage

1174
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,720
of all models are wrong and some are

1175
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,880
useful and all we're doing here is like

1176
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,440
making models and seeing what the

1177
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,800
outputs are. So, I don't know. I just I

1178
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,640
just feel like in this field there's a

1179
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,760
like there's a ground truth that we're

1180
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,480
trying to get to is like the philosophy.

1181
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,480
Whereas it seems like there maybe there

1182
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,720
are some useful models we can build and

1183
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,480
then everything that we are going to be

1184
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,520
able to say is going to relate to those

1185
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,480
models. So let's get very specific about

1186
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,000
like what models are we building and why

1187
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,359
type thing. I wonder what your reactions

1188
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,359
are to that. I I totally agree and I

1189
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,480
think that's that's one of the things in

1190
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,240
that uh in that review where we were

1191
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,079
talking about these different phenomena

1192
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,560
you know there's a section at the end

1193
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,240
where uh a couple people had read an

1194
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,760
initial draft of the manuscript and had

1195
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,400
said

1196
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,720
okay can you we want a final section

1197
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,359
that says which of these phenomena are

1198
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,440
mean it's a real GIE versus a spurious

1199
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,280
and as we tried to think like we can't

1200
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,720
answer it's not a question you can

1201
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,880
answer because some of these truly

1202
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,720
depend on your uh your scientific

1203
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,960
question. And so would one of the the

1204
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,319
calls there in that paper was basically

1205
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,880
just to say um to call for more clarity

1206
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:37,280
in the in at the outset of a G bye

1207
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,760
containing study to say we're looking

1208
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,359
for precision medicine application if we

1209
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,680
detect you know if our outcome of

1210
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,920
interest is LDL cholesterol and this is

1211
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,839
measured and clinically relevant on the

1212
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,319
raw scale on which it is measured in

1213
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,160
milligrams per deciliter uh and we're

1214
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,520
thinking about it in term we're always

1215
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,040
thinking about it in terms of percentage

1216
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,800
changes or we're always thinking about

1217
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,720
in terms of um when you take a statin, a

1218
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,680
doctor is going to think that you'll go

1219
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,520
down by 20 milligrams per deciliter.

1220
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,680
Will that be different by people? And if

1221
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:12,160
there's nonlinearity or nonhomogeneity

1222
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,240
in that, okay, maybe that's a clinical

1223
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,400
example where we care whether we care if

1224
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,280
that's going to happen somewhat

1225
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,440
regardless of the actual mechanism.

1226
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,200
Which of these phenomena are at play

1227
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,560
versus, you know, sometimes we might

1228
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,880
actually be thinking, well, we need

1229
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,480
better genetic discovery. We're doing a

1230
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,079
G-W was, but we want to incorporate

1231
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,560
interaction effects because we think

1232
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,599
there might be effect modification

1233
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,480
there. You really want to make sure

1234
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,480
If the mechanism is genetic variant

1235
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,599
correlating with exposure and that

1236
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,040
nonlinearity impacting the outcome,

1237
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,400
you haven't found what you're looking

1238
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,359
for if you're trying to map genetic

1239
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,960
lossi related to some trait because

1240
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,560
there's no causal relationship between

1241
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,800
the genotype and the the trait of

1242
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,400
interest. So if if that makes a little

1243
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,400
sense and at least how I'd start to

1244
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,839
approach thinking about it.

1245
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,319
>> Yeah. And I'd wonder what you mean by

1246
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,000
causal. But but another thought I guess

1247
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,880
um this way of thinking might suggest

1248
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,560
that some of the interesting like new

1249
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,160
biology would come by working with

1250
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,000
different types of people who might have

1251
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,200
different use cases and different things

1252
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,960
that they're interested in modeling. And

1253
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,200
I wonder if if you've experienced that

1254
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,640
like working with different people

1255
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,640
coming from a different disciplinary

1256
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,040
background or something might spur new

1257
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,200
directions or something. I I I mean I

1258
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,040
definitely this is a very broad sense

1259
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,960
but I think even working with clinicians

1260
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,119
for example is it was a big eye openener

1261
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,760
for me to then you know think about okay

1262
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,599
how are they thinking about the value of

1263
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,400
effect heterogeneity like this I'm

1264
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,480
excited because I have a p value of you

1265
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,920
know 0.006 O6 or something and they're

1266
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,319
saying well okay am I going to treat

1267
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,200
someone differently uh and so that you

1268
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,800
know the effect sizes etc are different.

1269
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,559
Yeah, thanks.

1270
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,440
>> Okay, I think we have time for one or

1271
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,240
two more questions. Go ahead.

1272
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,640
>> Just on on the same on the same note, I

1273
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,640
I was just thinking actually, so I know

1274
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,319
you say that biomedical is not the same

1275
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,599
than heritability. you know that we

1276
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,240
cannot say that more heritability

1277
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,119
necessarily is more beneficial for the

1278
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,800
clinics

1279
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,920
>> but if you can I don't know if the paper

1280
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,839
that you were talking about this

1281
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,160
partition uh polygenic scores by

1282
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,079
pathways actually are able to show that

1283
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,760
by aggregating all of those you can

1284
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,400
explain more heritability than just

1285
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,520
using the classic uh state-of-the-art

1286
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,160
polygenic risk score uh but I mean I

1287
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,160
guess that if you can say that you can

1288
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:34,640
globally explain more heritability by

1289
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:37,040
using this uh PRS S times E um

1290
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,200
uh components then I guess that there

1291
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,440
could be you know big value even for the

1292
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,599
clinics uh in that regard.

1293
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:49,200
>> Yeah. Um I think so a couple things one

1294
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,599
uh we have a similar I was showing a

1295
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,359
paper from another group but we we have

1296
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,960
also done a similar study to that create

1297
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,800
pathway specific polygenic scores and

1298
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,480
then test them for interaction. In that

1299
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,160
one, we did do a sort of likelihood

1300
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,920
ratio test to say if you put all these

1301
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:07,200
interactions in, do they explain more

1302
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,520
variance than just a polygenic score by

1303
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,880
E and they do quite substantially so

1304
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,640
when you combine them all together at

1305
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,280
least in our hands with one particular

1306
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,040
empirical example.

1307
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,480
So that was part of it and I'm already

1308
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,040
forgetting the second half of the

1309
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,680
question. No, I guess it's more about,

1310
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,200
you know, the variance explain versus

1311
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,960
biomedical utility uh of it. But I guess

1312
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,800
you know like you could totally say that

1313
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,720
uh if you can explain more variance then

1314
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,800
to some degree if there is the right

1315
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,280
route it's going to have some some

1316
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,800
utility at the at the clinic level. Uh

1317
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,640
yes and oh that's the last thing I was

1318
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,640
going to say is I think I definitely

1319
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,240
agree and I think there are some people

1320
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,040
thinking about this and even if we can

1321
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,000
squeeze out you know an extra

1322
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,599
performance improves by 10% 20% of

1323
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,680
standard polygenic scores that could be

1324
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,119
good I think the one tricky thing comes

1325
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,720
exposure measurement becomes a whole

1326
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,559
bigger whole much bigger thing there of

1327
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,680
course standardization of genotypes is

1328
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,359
one thing standardization of uh the you

1329
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,880
know what people are eating that what

1330
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,640
environment they're exposed to could

1331
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,720
become tricky there but not an

1332
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,119
unsurmountable insurmountable obstacle.

1333
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,839
Yeah. Yeah.

1334
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,359
>> Okay. Thanks um so much for your talk. I

1335
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,119
think we had a great discussion and so

1336
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:21,000
everyone can move to the seminar at

1337
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,000
9:30. But thank you.
