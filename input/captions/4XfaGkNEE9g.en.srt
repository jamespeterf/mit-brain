00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,000
hello as the last element in our

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
discussion of musical representations I

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,279
want to talk about two different

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,240
fundamental ways that we can represent

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,359
musical

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,039
scores TimeWise and partwise and these

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,199
really matter in anything that has more

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,640
than one note or more than one independ

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,719
part going s once and I want to

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
acknowledge I'm going to be using slides

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,320
from a presentation called notation as

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,840
composition by William Andrew burnson

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,920
creator of the B bage notation

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,800
package one of the ways that we can look

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,320
at musical notes is as musical scores is

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,120
as a series of containers so that we can

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,800
think of uh and part based containers so

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,920
we have a score and within that score as

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,799
the first element we have two parts in

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,159
this case and within those parts we have

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,040
measures and we might even go further

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,400
and think that within those measures we

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,960
have voices but first when we think

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,040
about dividing a score into parts let's

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,360
say it's you know the score of um a

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
massive three-hour Opera well you start

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,920
with you whatever's at the top of the

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,720
piccolo or something like that and you

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,040
go with the piccolo part from measure

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,200
one all the way to the end of the three

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,560
hours then you go to the second part

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,759
probably the flute and you go all the

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,960
way from one to the end and so on and so

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,479
you have everything in one part from the

35
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,000
beginning to the end and it makes it

36
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,000
very easy to do the kinds of analysis

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,119
that look at what happens in the

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,040
part the other principal way of looking

39
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,680
at musical notation representation is

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,880
you have a score and within that you

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,520
have all the things that happen at a

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,320
certain moment so that be getting you

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,399
know you might say well there's all the

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,560
clubs and if it's a 10 bar score you

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,200
might have trouble trouble trouble

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,200
trouble trouble Alto base base Bas base

47
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,920
Bas so on and then you have all the time

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,519
signature key signatures all the time

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,800
signatures and then every note

50
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,879
everything that happens at the beginning

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,680
of the

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:26,760
piece and then you have everything that

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,959
happens at the next instant the next

54
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,879
time that something happens here

55
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,480
and in this particular case when we get

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:41,400
to the third instant um which is the E

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,560
quarter note in the base and then the c

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,680
u the C eighth note in the E there there

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,200
is something that's happening in the top

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,159
part that that g half note that is not

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,800
represented in that instant but is

62
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,840
thought to be continuing from before and

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,519
in the next instant the there was just a

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,319
an eighth note with nothing else

65
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,879
happening and so this makes it very nice

66
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,280
to see what's happening at every attack

67
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,360
and you might be able to

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
programmatically go back and see what's

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,000
happening at every instant but it makes

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,519
it very hard instead to figure out

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,680
what's happening from one uh beginning

72
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,239
of the score to the

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:28,200
End by the way we call these instance uh

74
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,360
instance or uh offset moments or you

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,319
know cuts through hierarchies generally

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,480
speaking but often we Cally call these

77
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,680
salami slices in the process of creating

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,319
these things salami

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,640
slicing it's just kind of something

80
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,959
that's come out in music 21 we call this

81
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,760
process codification and so you'll see

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:54,319
the cify happens a lot so which is

83
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,400
better part-based containers or time

84
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,040
based

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,680
containers each of these formats has

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,319
their own POS positive things and

87
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,799
drawbacks as I said part-based

88
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,959
containers make it very easy for us to

89
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,360
follow an entire part from beginning to

90
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,599
end an entire line from beginning to end

91
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,079
time based containers let us see what

92
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,519
chords are happening in a certain moment

93
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,199
but very hard to follow

94
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,360
Melody but each of them has certain uh

95
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,199
certain difficult to encode things for

96
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,199
instance in alia staff uh a staff where

97
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,880
something uh optional is happening or or

98
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,520
you can do this instead of something

99
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,680
else what part is that in how do you

100
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,240
encode that uh do you put a part with

101
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,600
hidden measures all the way up to this

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,680
moment and hidden measures all the way

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,199
to the end and how do we indicate that

104
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,080
the player could do this so this is

105
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,880
something that's very hard to encode

106
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,759
when we do part-based representations so

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,560
instead let's move to time based

108
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,199
representations because it doesn't have

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,120
this they don't have this problem but

110
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,479
instead they have other problems where

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,800
do we put these Grace notes uh in you

112
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,440
know in in encoding like this especially

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,160
when you know we know that not all five

114
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
of those Grace notes come after that

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,600
last let's assum it's trouble in base

116
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,479
Club after that last B of the sub tuplet

117
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,880
within the triplet you know where do we

118
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,440
go how do we encode Grace notes do they

119
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,720
attach to the note next to them or or

120
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,240
what and both of the representations

121
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,199
have maj problems when we want to look

122
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,280
at things that involve horizontal and

123
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,520
vertical at the same time things like

124
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,520
voice leading here's a common uh voice

125
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,800
leading error in uh in sort of very

126
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:50,120
strict traditional uh harmonic writing

127
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,680
where we have um and we have a overlap

128
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,479
where the low G crosses the boundary

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,039
established by the B before and goes up

130
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,639
to the C above it which form format

131
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,960
makes this possible to see if you're

132
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,360
just look at each part alone you see

133
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,880
okay there's a b going to an E then we

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,039
get to the next part there's a g going

135
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,680
to a c but you don't see that the G

136
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,319
Going to the C overlap the B going to an

137
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:23,599
e on the other hand if we look at it in

138
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:26,000
time based we have a g and a b and we

139
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,160
look at that then the next part we see

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,720
there's a c and an e but it's hard to

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,800
tell well did the G go to the C did the

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,360
G go to the E did the you what what

143
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,720
happened how's the voice leading happen

144
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,080
so these are the problems in musical

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,080
representations and we'll quite often

146
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,280
find that we have to convert from

147
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,120
part-based representation to time based

148
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,479
representation and back or in the case

149
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,720
of a voice leading moment we have to

150
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,280
keep both the part and the time based

151
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,599
representations in in our head in the

152
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,400
musical memory in the representation at

153
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,039
the same time in order to find these

154
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,160
things I find these problems really cool

155
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,400
and hope you guys do too and solving

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,240
them is is another one of the great

157
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,240
choice of this class
