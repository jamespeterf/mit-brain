1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,240
Um, but I am really glad to uh invite

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,480
Nikki Bruno up to speak not about what

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,880
keeps her awake at night in the middle

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,920
of the night, but instead Well, I guess

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,640
it is the same thing, isn't it?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,119
>> Different twist. Yes. Uh so thank you so

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,480
much for for sharing uh your perspective

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,800
on scaling.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,800
>> Yeah,

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,360
>> thank you and hi everyone. Um thank you

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,239
for having me. This has been a wonderful

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,719
wonderful day. Um and you know when you

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,960
think about the utility what I came into

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
was the power of the people panel. Um I

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,360
missed the the very first one. Um but

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,399
you know there there is a general

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,879
mistrust and a general dislike or even

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
like even worse negligence about the

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,320
utility, right? like I I don't know if

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,359
it's better to be loved or hated, but if

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,280
you don't feel anything, you know, so um

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
you know, and I before coming to work at

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
the utility, I kind of fell accidentally

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
into the energy space. I have a degree

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,119
in environmental science. Um but you

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,640
know, life goes on, right? And it looks

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,600
beautiful on a resume and all stitched

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,000
together, but um you realize the energy

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,640
is just such a it's a commodity. It's so

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
needed. And I never knew all the work

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,880
that the utility workers, gas or

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,119
electric, do, water for that matter. Um

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,960
but I think it's on us to continually

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,680
change and evolve the perspective of

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,280
right we have to earn our keep. Um we

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,200
have a lot of beautiful touch points

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
with the customer that many people do

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,560
not. Um and that's a privilege and I

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
think there you would find uh was just

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,119
on the phone earlier this morning about

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
it. A lot of people have ingrained and

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,880
don't sleep at night around the fact

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
that they have to provide safe and

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,880
reliable service and and I know um

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,880
gentleman earlier was mentioning what

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,439
does reliable mean? When I say reliable,

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,320
it's there for them all the time 247

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,600
365. Um so that's why some of us don't

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,159
sleep. Um, but you know on the geo front

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
it's it's been such a happy discussion

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,640
and I'm going to be blending in kind of

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,959
when we talk about scaling scaling

53
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,720
technical systems certainly how we're

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,800
thinking about our pilot in Framingham

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,520
and what's next how it went what we can

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,920
learn but also how we can scale that

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,400
change management because there has to

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,120
be a cultural shift in not only the

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
utility but the um folks we interact

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,000
with whether they're stakeholders,

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,640
community partners, customers,

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319
regulators Everybody has to adjust and

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,879
we're in this enormous transition

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,400
period, right? And I think, you know,

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,840
we've always said this in various

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,720
places, but this pictorial example does

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,560
not get built with one group. Um, and

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,239
the reason this it may not feel like

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,040
it's fast if you look like at this

70
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,840
timeline, but being the first time we've

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,519
certainly done this, it it is fast and

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
it only happened because there were a

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
lot of groups involved. Um, you know,

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,200
certainly Zanab and the heat team right

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
at the forefront really, I would argue

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
before I even came to Eversource putting

77
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
it out there in front of the DPU at the

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,560
time to say, "Hey, the gas company could

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,040
do this. Let's give them a shot." Um,

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
and so what you see here is from 2019

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,360
when this was initially proposed to we

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,239
commissioned the system in Framingham in

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,879
2024, a lot of blood, sweat, and tears.

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,319
And you know, when we um maybe when you

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,239
hopefully when you're picking up news

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,640
articles online or otherwise, you see

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,799
all the great um heralding about how

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,519
this has been successful. I will tell

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,480
you it's it's been tough. Um there's a

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,720
lot of learning, a lot of scars. Uh but

91
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,920
everybody has done so with such grace.

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,080
And what I mean by that is they are

93
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,680
willing and they want to show up to do

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,280
this. So I was asked earlier, the gas

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,959
companies want to do this? are they

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,519
excited about this? Like how how do they

97
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
feel? Um and you know I think there

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
again even within your own internal

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
company constituents you have to earn

100
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,480
trust. You have to earn that this is

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,640
additive. This is a positive and a

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,200
benefit. Um and then when you talk about

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,080
the pace of change, how things can scale

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,120
and take off. Um we have a lot of folks

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,360
that we brought in that were gas

106
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
personnel. That's all they did all day

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,079
long and we're very proud of it. um had

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,239
a skill set, had a passion, had a

109
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,880
career. Um and when we put them on

110
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,040
things like Oversight for Construction,

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,440
um it was amazing to see just how they

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759
delved in open-minded and took it on as

113
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,000
if it were their own gas project. Um and

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,600
at the end of it, um the most gratifying

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
thing certainly is to hear like, wow,

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
this was a pretty amazing project to

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,560
work on. That's what that's the

118
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,479
ultimate, right? Um so we're

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,440
consistently trying to educate

120
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,360
internally and ed and even our electric

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
brethren. I'll say now that doesn't you

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,440
know that goes beyond gas right

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,759
electric's got their work to do on the

124
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,600
utility side and because this is a true

125
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
hybrid and has benefit across all

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,880
systems got to educate them too and

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,120
they've got a lot going on. So anyway,

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,080
um just you know when you think about

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,320
milestones on the timeline you say oh

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
this is a project right normal course of

131
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,520
business you do the feasibility you get

132
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
the budget the estimate put it together

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,120
you get customers you start construction

134
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,800
you put it online all of these steps um

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
we that flying the plane as you're

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,120
building it that that was what was going

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,960
on um and not to shake anybody's

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,680
confidence in the utilities ability or

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,960
the partners contractors etc teammates

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,520
ability to do this um but as as you

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,759
heard from um many speakers today a lot

142
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,280
of this is art and science. So when we

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,520
think about site selection and

144
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,240
evaluating we had about 20 sites that we

145
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,160
looked at um and it was really unique

146
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,560
because I think from the get-go one of

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,639
the big lessons learned about um these

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
networks and the ability to scale is we

149
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,240
had a crossf functional group of people

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
in the room. So where maybe our a

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,759
traditional infrastructure gas or

152
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
electric you'd go to the DPW you'd go to

153
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,919
the permitting agencies then you engage

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
the community maybe at some level

155
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,400
depending on the project size we were

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,720
with the community and key folks in

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
government community representatives in

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,400
some cases in one location we didn't go

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,840
with there was an active resident who

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,440
petitioned her legislator um gathered

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
the neighborhood it was that was an

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
awful phone call to make by the way to

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,039
call her and say I'm sorry we're not

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,800
bringing it to your city um but she

165
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,720
respected the engagement and I think

166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,639
that early engagement troubleshoots a

167
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,039
lot of problems down the road. So that's

168
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,039
something we want to do to continue

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,600
building on, you know, the success that

170
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,240
we think we've had with the community um

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,000
in Framingham. Um we talk about

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,400
permitting, right? I heard a lot in the

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,639
last presentation about rules and

174
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,080
regulations. The US is a little bit of

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
the wild west, right? I mean, we don't

176
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,199
even have the nomenclature set out. Um

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,880
and that's confusing for people. Um, and

178
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,240
so I think what what kind of

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,160
environmental permits do we need? What

180
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,600
kind of city like planning zoning type

181
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,080
permits do you need? This gets very

182
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,000
local very fast. Um, and I think what

183
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,639
happened in Framingham is really a

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,599
testament to the city in this case

185
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,080
figuring it out with us. So we spent a

186
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,080
ton of time meeting with them. In fact,

187
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,960
um, I would argue in in all truth, we

188
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,400
talk to them more than daily. And um,

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,080
you know, we know what's everyone knows

190
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,560
what's going on on the project in their

191
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,479
personal lives. It's like the customers.

192
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
And with that kind of trust, we were

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,400
able to say, okay, we don't know what

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,160
permits apply. This is a closed loop

195
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,160
system. Do we really need to go for that

196
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,599
board of health, you know, water type

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,840
permit? Do we really need to go for

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,560
that? Um, we'll gladly come before

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,400
whatever council or permitting body, but

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,599
maybe maybe it doesn't apply right now.

201
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,919
And they were like, you know, maybe

202
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,440
that's right. Okay. And in with the

203
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,560
right protections, with the right

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,000
construction methodology, we avoided a

205
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
lot of time I feel like spent on

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,599
permitting or if we had to get a permit,

207
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,360
we had educated so much that it moved

208
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,720
through in a manageable fashion. And and

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
certainly in the state of Massachusetts,

210
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,479
there was recent legislation passed. I

211
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
was really excited about the geo work.

212
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,960
Um, but within that a lot of expedited

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,800
permitting and sighting for clean energy

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
um because it is it does bog down

215
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,520
schedule and timelines. And so I really

216
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,120
enthused from that perspective and again

217
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,879
another another component from a scaling

218
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
um perspective that we want to take and

219
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,400
bring forward.

220
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,080
When we think about what we're going to

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,919
learn here though that's that's really

222
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,919
what excites me and I I want to spend

223
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,240
just a few minutes talking about the

224
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,160
customer side of this. Um, Eric Bosworth

225
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
will be here tomorrow to talk about all

226
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,800
the tech, commissioning, construction,

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,440
drilling, all of that, which is very

228
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,279
important. But to me, it's I should say

229
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,839
and to me, it's a combination of

230
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,360
customer and technical. Um, it it kind

231
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,959
of is playing out that way in a lot of

232
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,159
the dockets and a lot of the discussion

233
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,959
around NPA around integrated planning.

234
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,959
The planning is crucial um and and needs

235
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,560
to be sound based on data, etc. You need

236
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,240
to have the customer piece. you need to

237
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
have the execution ability to go out

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,279
there and actually build what you're

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
talking about because otherwise we're

240
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,000
just talking about it. And so in in

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Framingham as I move to the next slide

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,560
here um we have taken the momentum of

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,360
the pilot and are now on a grant um that

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,120
even you know optimistic even with the

245
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,240
administration geothermal is a very

246
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,440
bipartisan discussion and because I

247
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,440
think we've we've thought about it from

248
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,600
a customer perspective just on our in

249
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,399
our um world in Massachusetts and

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,320
Connecticut if it can make fiscal sense

251
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
and provide environmental benefits if we

252
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,880
can get this whole thing to work. Um, it

253
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
doesn't just have to work for climate

254
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,839
advocates. It doesn't just have to work

255
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,080
for folks concerned about future

256
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
generations. It's going to be an ant.

257
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
It's going to be for people who want

258
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
effective heating and cooling from a

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,399
cost perspective. So, what we're trying

260
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,240
to do on this grant um, in effect is get

261
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,760
data back from both a customer

262
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,680
perspective, technical performance

263
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
perspective to see those economies of

264
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,519
scale as you build on this. And we've

265
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,600
already seen it in our design. Um, costs

266
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,240
have come down. We're smarter, leaner,

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,080
faster, all that good stuff. Um, and I'm

268
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
so excited and and hope the grant comes

269
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
in certainly, but you know, at

270
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,160
Eversource at least, we're thinking

271
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,480
about how do we make a coherent rate

272
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,200
proposal, project proposal using

273
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,880
examples. We still have to learn, but to

274
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,880
make sure that we're advancing this so

275
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,440
it can stand on its own eventually. It's

276
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
not on subsidies.

277
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
Just a pictorial of it. Um, doubling the

278
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,120
size of the pilot. This is the

279
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,959
expansion. And um we don't talk a lot

280
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,200
about delivered fuels customers, oil,

281
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,600
propane, a lot of them here. So this

282
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
could be accretive to a business, right?

283
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,839
We could gain customers that we're not

284
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,760
cannibalizing or we're not netting out

285
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,399
net neutral, right? We are actually

286
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,480
adding. Um and you know, for folks like

287
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
me that like to build things. That's

288
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
exciting.

289
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
So let me just wrap with some of the

290
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,279
opportunities and challenges and I'm

291
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,519
happy to take questions later. um strong

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
emissions goals here, targets here in

293
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,519
Massachusetts and in a lot of the states

294
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,160
we operate in. Um regardless of where

295
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,920
the federal government goes, we see, you

296
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,760
know, being good stewards, right, that

297
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,440
we want to provide solutions and options

298
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,519
for our customers. And when you go into

299
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
more of a I call it like the subsidy

300
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,680
verse tax. If you go into more of a

301
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,000
positive mindset to give customers more

302
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,760
choice, we find that that naturally puts

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
them it doesn't back them into a corner,

304
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,040
right? We talked about obligation to

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,640
serve and customer choice. It gives them

306
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,720
more to choose from and they feel like

307
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,680
they are in control of their destiny.

308
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
Um, a lot of customers and communities

309
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,480
have expressed interest. We had to turn

310
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,720
people away with the pilot. Now, we were

311
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,120
paying for quite a bit on our tab um or

312
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,279
on the rateayers collectively tabs, but

313
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,440
it, you know, it begs the question of

314
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,279
who else will go into this with us and

315
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,040
how can we leverage that excitement,

316
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,920
that momentum, that desire to bring this

317
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,839
to whatever municipality we're in. the

318
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,600
data will provide the learnings and you

319
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,399
know I think the DOE liftoff report was

320
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,720
really key new construction we have all

321
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,040
these policies right to kind of styy gas

322
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,120
growth and what do we replace it with if

323
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,279
folks don't want airsource heat pumps

324
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,480
this is like a natural fit we see so

325
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,240
we're trying to attack the new

326
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
construction market work with our

327
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
existing relationships with those

328
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
customers in this case builders

329
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
developers who give them another option

330
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
give them hopefully a better option

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,519
right the challenges I think on the

332
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
other side as you think about scaling

333
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,279
are really things that have been

334
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
mentioned already. Um but certainly

335
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,519
workforce who can do this work. Um

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,519
there's a variety of work streams that

337
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,200
we know how to do that are transferable.

338
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,560
Something like drilling, we don't have

339
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,920
that skill set, right? And that's

340
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,800
largely the bottleneck. Um the cost

341
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,440
certainly too. This is an upfront capex

342
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,040
investment that you make um that that

343
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,839
you know we have to figure out a way to

344
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,480
manage and spread um so that folks can

345
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,000
enjoy the savings on the back end. And I

346
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,600
think the utility is actually a great

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
vehicle because folks were talking about

348
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,720
putting in their own systems. It's

349
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,399
expensive. Um it really is. And so um in

350
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,399
wrapping, you know, we're trying to

351
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
identify locations that are best suited

352
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,480
from a technical perspective to deploy

353
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
that the customers want that we can make

354
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
the argument for them on a couple of

355
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,000
different fronts, not just environmental

356
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,560
emissions reductions. Um so that we

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,600
could ultimately lower the cost of the

358
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,079
project on on a whole. And so with that,

359
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
um, I guess I'll say we're we're already

360
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,279
seeing kind of acceleration here. We're

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,480
still in that data collection. I'm a

362
