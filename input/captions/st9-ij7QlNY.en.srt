1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,520
Hi everyone. I'm Caitlyn Infantino. I'm

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,160
the co-founder and CRO of Blue Sarah.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,320
Um, and today I want to invite you to

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,360
think about how ecom could be better for

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,080
everyone from the customer experience

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,080
through the brand experience.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,680
Quickly

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,720
quickly, I want to introduce our team.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,279
Uh, George Manley serves as our CEO. He

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,960
draws an extensive experience in CPG

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,600
sales, fundraising, and property

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
development management. Um, his

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,879
background has equipped him with a

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,600
strong financial acumen and a sharp

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,079
ability to navigate complex

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,280
uh, contract negotiations.

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,120
Tim Owen is our CTO. Uh, he's got a deep

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,680
background in predictive modeling and

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,600
machine learning. Tim built um, a

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
successful software company called Data

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,199
Robot from the ground up. It's now at

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,760
about a $7 billion valuation. Uh, data

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,000
robot enables everyone from larger

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,960
enterprise customers to smaller business

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,720
owners to effectively build their own

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,760
predictive modeling. Uh Tom spent many

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,840
years at Saks Fifth Avenue as GMM and

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,159
Katherine Havasi um as a former MIT PI

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,880
um and on our advisory board she's done

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:29,159
something um with customer feedback um

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,159
in the CPG space as well.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,680
I suppose I should tell you about myself

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,280
for a minute. Um, I have a uh a

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,119
background in uh the shoe industry, but

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,600
um I really sort of cut my teeth in the

36
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,280
startup world selling foam to shoe

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,079
companies from everybody from Nike to

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,320
Jimmy Shu.

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,960
So, a quick story. This is how Blue

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,360
Sarah came to be. Uh it's birthday

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,119
season in our house, a couple of kids

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,040
and I'm just trying to buy one simple

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,840
thing, towels with ears and tails and

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
I've got five web pages open to do it.

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
Um

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,479
our ecom activity is spread out all over

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,879
the web. So even if you do get it done,

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,200
you've got emails coming into your inbox

49
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,720
one after another trying to figure out,

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,319
you know, where your shipping's coming

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
from.

52
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,720
There's counterfeits coming in. I just

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,520
spoke to a guy who returned $2,000 worth

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,239
of light bulbs. And consumers and brands

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,560
want an alternative to Amazon. So, you

56
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,640
know, I didn't like the product search

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
results. I didn't like how I had to get

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,120
it if I didn't want to just buy from

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,800
Amazon. I wanted to put one towel from

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
the company store and one towel from

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
Pottery Barn into one cart and check

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,879
out.

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,879
So, talked with a bunch of people about

64
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,400
this and did a ton of product research.

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,800
There's 81 billion views on #shop small.

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,200
There's a subreddit with 3.2 million

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
people for buy it for life. There's all

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,319
these different factions on the internet

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,280
looking for an alternative way to shop.

70
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,680
Here's the solution. With AI, we can

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
offer fast, intelligent, personalized

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,640
search results. We can eliminate

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
counterfeits. We can allow you to keep

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
multiple carts in one place and check

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,159
out from multiple stores with a click of

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,840
one button. We've put ads in a silo so

77
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
that you can go there when you want to

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,519
use them to be inspired to find

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,840
something different. But when you're

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,040
searching for something, all of that is

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,280
driven by your preferences and your

82
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,400
search activity. And then obviously it's

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,599
voice controlled and um completely

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,760
intuitive. So I'm going to show you a

85
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,760
quick demo.

86
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,799
Can you hear it?

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,599
Dare to imagine your customers shopping

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,040
online in a new world of product search

89
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,040
results. Let me show you how your

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
customers will be shown your brand and

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
your products exactly when they're

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
looking to buy them. There are no paid

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,480
promotions in this part of the app. The

94
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,480
customer drives the discovery.

95
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,200
Customers will be able to find your

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,200
products in store, too.

97
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,479
These are the carts where customers can

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,400
build and save all of their shopping

99
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,639
projects from all over the internet in

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,639
one place.

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,240
When the customer checks out, your brand

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,520
receives 100% of the margin and your

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,520
brand is the merchant of record

104
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,280
>> because our customers understand that

105
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,120
the inspiration tab is only for ads.

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
Your marketing content will be your

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,720
customer they're wanting to sold to.

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,120
They're in the mood to window shop.

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,199
By sharing your ads with friends, your

110
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
customers make inspiring marketing and

111
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,600
products they love go viral. They can

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,880
purchase right in the app where you

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,720
still receive 100% of the margin.

114
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,360

>> So, here's what we are what we need.

Now, we're calling on all industries

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:04,479
from shirts to pants to hammers to Bose

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,479
headphones. We'd love for you to join

It's free and it's going to be free for

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,440
at least the next six months is what

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,600
we're thinking. Um, please connect to

133

online, and wholesale account inventory.

135
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,199
Um, we can connect your APIs as well if

136
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,840
that's more convenient, if you want to

137
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,680
give us permission. Um, that will save

138
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,120
us compute

139
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:39,280
um, and and help with, you know,

140
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,240
timing, latency,

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:48,240
um, and then, you know, integrate for a

142
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:52,560
faster seamless checkout. Um,

143
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,960
and give the blue Sarah bot permission.

144
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,120
That's what we need.

145
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,520
>> Thank you, Caitlyn. [sighs]

146
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:05,039
So, um, let me ask you, how are you

147
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,560
different from any other ecom market

148
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,880
place?

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,000
>> 100% of the sale goes to the brand.

150
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,240
Every time we put your ads in front of

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,360
people who are looking to see them in

152
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,280
the beginning when the when the customer

153
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,440
first comes everything they see is is

154
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,039
driven by the preferences their

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,639
preferences what we already know about

156
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,880
them and what they're looking for that

157
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:34,160
day. So we can deliver um better search

158
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,960
results that aren't all paid promotions.

159
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,280
So it it'll drive your customers to the

160
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,120
correct products much more efficiently

161
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
and then when they're looking to be sold

162
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,960
sold to they'll go to our inspiration

163
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,720
tab and enjoy your marketing.

164
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,840
Um zero paid promotions um in that first

165
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,440
part of the app and then you know I

166
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,759
think what really makes us different is

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,400
that we're a service to the customer and

168
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,160
the brand. It's a completely different

169
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,879
economic setup than anything that's out

170
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,080
there today. Yeah. And so tell us a

171
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,639
little more about how the brands can

172
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,440
integrate.

173
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,039
>> Um initially we'll be scraping all CPG

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,879
websites for products and product

175
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,240
attributes. Um the the best way to

176
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,639
integrate is to first of all give our

177
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
bot permission and then we welcome the

178
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,879
opportunity to connect to your APIs so

179
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,680
we can grab your product catalog um

180
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,759
and you know can advertise directly with

181
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
us.

182
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,919
>> Okay. And one final question as we wrap

183
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,680
up. What is um your business model

184
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,320
and the revenue stream?
