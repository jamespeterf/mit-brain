1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,160
my name is Ricardo heral on behalf of

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,880
the Rene Salazar speaker series and

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,000
latinx at bro and we are a group a

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,559
latinx community and the mission is to

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,039
build community among latinx broes and

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,279
allies and empowering members of the

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,800
latinx communities this this is also

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,199
Hispanic Heritage Month and we had

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,199
several events for Hispanic Heritage

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
Month including the apple picking and we

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,519
had craft chica today so we have a lot

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,519
of events associated with Hispanic

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,800
Heritage Month and promoting latinxt

14
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,399
individuals in science and research

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,239
so the role or the goal of the Rene

16
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,239
salsar speaker series is to highlight

17
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,399
latinx and diverse researchers within

18
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,719
and outside the broad we want to Foster

19
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,559
collaboration and we want to allow

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,600
visibility and role models for diverse

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,840
individuals we also want to allow

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,399
opportunities to network and promote

23
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,079
research and from there I wanted to

24
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,840
introduce our speaker so our speaker is

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,640
Dr Victoria Costa Rodriguez of the ni

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,960
and the talk will be entitled circadian

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,559
interventions to promote healthier

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,519
longevity of mammals

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,000
Dr Victoria cost Rodriguez received a

30
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,840
PhD in chemistry from the National

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,880
University of Ora in Argentina and

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,799
during her PhD in the laboratory of Dr

33
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,360
Mario Guido she investigated the

34
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,200
Circadian control of phospholipid

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,080
metabolism using an invitro model of

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,439
peripheral clocks she joed she joined Dr

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,280
Joseph Takahashi at UT Southwestern

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,840
Medical Center for a post-doctoral

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,000
training to understand how organisms

40
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,680
coordinate their met metabolism at

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,799
specific times of the day to promote

42
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,640
well-being first she designed automated

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
feeders to demonstrate that by

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
restricting calories mice not only eat

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,360
less but also shorten their feeding

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,240
window she then discovered that feeding

47
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,280
time is critical to maximize systemic

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,200
benefits of caloric restriction or like

49
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,920
on lifespan and maintenance of robust

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
orcadian gene expression as mice age all

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
together her findings challenged the

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
prevailing view that pro- longevity

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,600
benefits of caloric restriction come

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,719
from lower intake or fasting alone

55
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,520
instead she found in hands benefits are

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,920
achieved when feeding fasting time is

57
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,159
aligned with the natural active phase as

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,880
dictated by Circa clocks and these

59
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,799
findings reveal circadian clocks as

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,039
potential targets for delaying the onet

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,440
of age related diseases so in 2024 Dr

62
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,599
aasa Rodriguez joined the NIH as an Earl

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,280
stman tenure track investigator where

64
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,640
she leads the Circadian biology of Aging

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,400
unit and she's also NH distinguished

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,480
scholar since 2024 so take it away Dr

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,319
Victoria Costa Rodriguez so thank you so

68
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,959
much for the opportunity to present uh

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,680
the research that I've been doing since

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,239
my uh PhD but mainly in my post talk and

71
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,640
specially In This Very Special month for

72
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:45,040
um me because it's the her Spanish

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:49,519
Heritage H month and so as um Ricardo

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,680
said I have a long interest um long-term

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,239
interest in understanding how circadian

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:00,040
clocks can influence health status in

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,519
mammals but how did I started so I I'm

78
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,519
originally from Argentina I was born

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,000
here by the Andes on the mountains in

80
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,040
this city called sanquan and then I

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,799
moved to Cordova to do my uh

82
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:18,519
PhD that H after my PhD that was focused

83
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,560
on understanding the Circadian h control

84
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:25,400
of fpid metabolism I moved to Dallas

85
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,920
Texas to do my post talk looking for a

86
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,599
more broader um aspect of the Circadian

87
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,799
biology not just looking at one specific

88
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,040
metabolism but rather what it's

89
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,879
happening in the body the systemic

90
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,599
control and then recently like as

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,959
Ricardo mentioned I just started my um

92
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,920
Pi position at NIH but how do we get

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,360
into circadian biology and aging and

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,680
this is because of food so caloric

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,920
restriction was the first and is the

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,280
most studied intervention known to

97
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,680
promote health and lifespan in mammals

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,680
okay and what CAU our attention is not

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,079
just um the this remarkable prolongevity

100
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,959
um benefit but rather it's unusual

101
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,280
feeding

102
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,280
Behavior I

103
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,120
have sorry can you see my Pon yes okay

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,240
so basically we became interested in

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,680
this intervention not only because of

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,639
this remarkable prolongevity

107
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,120
intervention that show shows that when

108
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,880
mice are eating 30% less of the calories

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,919
as compared to Anum controlled mice mice

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,240
can leave significantly longer but what

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,759
was very interesting for us is their

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,080
unusual feeding Behavior so in this case

113
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,680
the mice were allowed to eat in the

114
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,360
morning from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. a

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,160
time at which mice nocturnal mice do not

116
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,320
normally eat because it's the normal

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,560
rest phase and also the food was

118
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,840
provided three times a week instead of

119
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,600
so this unusual protocol is because

120
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,120
these longevity experiments in mice are

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,320
time consuming it requires to feed the

122
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,400
mice one like every day seven days a

123
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,440
week throughout the entire duration of

124
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,759
the experiment that in this case is like

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,319
over three years so to overcome uh these

126
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,759
difficulties in performing this type of

127
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,039
experiments I developed an automated

128
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,319
feeder system with this system I could

129
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,000
control exactly how much and when a

130
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,000
mouse is allowed to eat and the system

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,479
was also coupled with the wheel running

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,800
activity which is an output of the

133
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,960
central clock the internal timee keeping

134
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,039
of the organism which again in mice is

135
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,520
nighttime so we

136
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,000
can simultaneously record these two

137
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,759
behaviors that H feeding and wheel

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,240
running activity in this activity

139
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,039
recording that we called actogram that

140
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,880
shows minute by minute resolution every

141
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,680
day across multiple days of

142
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,120
experiment so with this system we asked

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,560
how do mice under caloric restriction

144
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,800
behave and this is first the control

145
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,360
group that is at libitum just to see

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,080
what's happening in the control

147
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,919
conditions so under at libitum condition

148
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,080
H mice are exposed to a 12 hours light H

149
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,160
that starts at 7:00 a.m. and 12 hours

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,759
dark cycle starting at 7 p.m. and what

151
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,120
we can see is like both wheel running

152
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,800
and feeding Behavior are mainly

153
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,000
Consolidated during the night time 75

154
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,919
80% of the activity is

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,160
nocturnal which is

156
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,360
expected now what we found is like after

157
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,120
the first quick of at libitum if we

158
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,319
limit the amount of food we removed 30%

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,120
of their normal intake and now the food

160
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,960
starts at 7:00 a.m. in the morning like

161
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,680
the previous protocol that I showed that

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,639
PR of longevity we can see that mice

163
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,000
Goods rapidly consolid at and eat their

164
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,319
food within 2 hours since the food is

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,560
given yet the activity remains nocturnal

166
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:14,879
so basically this protocol can somehow

167
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,199
um uncouple this feeding and not and whe

168
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,879
running activity that is normally

169
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,039
nocturnal in mice and the same thing

170
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,639
happens if now the food starts is

171
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,759
limited amount of food but it starts at

172
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,280
the beginning of their normal active

173
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,720
phase at night there is still till 2

174
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,560
hours consolidation so basically what

175
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,120
this experiment showed us is that under

176
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,440
classic caloric restriction protocols

177
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,840
the mice were not only eating less but

178
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,720
also they self-impose a severe Tim

179
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,960
restricted feeding in which they have

180
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,479
prolonged fasting periods and the timing

181
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,240
of the food intake it also matters if

182
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,080
you start at the beginning of the day or

183
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,800
at the beginning of the night so our

184
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,080
question was okay since we know that all

185
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,919
these three feeding factors how much

186
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,560
when and how often we eat they have

187
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,080
influence of many this chronic diseases

188
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,120
that are associated with age we wonder

189
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,039
which of these three feeding factors

190
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,440
that are all combined in a single

191
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,879
protocol which of them was actually

192
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,800
contributing to longevity so to address

193
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,400
this we did a comprehensive uh feeding

194
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,400
protocol in which we tested six feeding

195
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,560
groups so here I'm just showing the all

196
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,800
and the first group is the control group

197
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,519
mice are eating all they want whenever

198
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,800
they want then we have two control

199
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,560
groups that are the classic protocols

200
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,880
that we showed before that self impose

201
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,160
two hours

202
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,720
feeding and then to get around this Bing

203
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,120
eating Behavior we were able to actually

204
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,839
spread out now the food to 12 hours

205
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,640
during the day or during the night and

206
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,880
very importantly with this system we

207
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,880
were able to actually have a caloric

208
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,440
restriction group that has only

209
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:11,040
reduction in calories but with without

210
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,720
any fasting or feeding cycle continuous

211
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,959
feeding and then we asked which of these

212
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,720
intervention was actually promoting

213
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:22,519
lifespan what is important in this case

214
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,760
is all of these groups all these CR

215
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,760
calorically restricted mice are eating

216
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,200
exactly the same amount of food every

217
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,040
day is regular CH and and the only

218
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,440
difference between these groups is

219
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:40,800
actually the feeding pattern that mice

220
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,920
experience so um this is just to show um

221
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,079
like an activity recording of three

222
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,560
years of continuous recording for a

223
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,880
representative mice and their ad lium

224
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,640
group that basically we can see that the

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,000
mice are nocturnal but the activity the

226
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,959
nocturnal activity basically declines as

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,880
they

228
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,680
age and for all the other eating

229
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,480
conditions regardless of when they were

230
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,079
eating we can see that the activity is

231
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,440
still nocturnal meaning that that the

232
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,519
internal clock of the organism remains

233
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,320
locked to the

234
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,120
nighttime now we can also see that for

235
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,079
each of the feeding conditions the

236
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,959
feeding pattern that they adopt early in

237
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:27,360
life is actually maintained throughout

238
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:30,200
the experiment meaning that some uh even

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,320
for this a very strange continuous

240
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,640
feeding in which mice are continuously

241
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,800
eating throughout the day so the

242
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,079
question um then we can actually

243
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,240
quantify all of these behaviors and

244
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,720
basically we can see here in the top we

245
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,800
are seeing the 24-hour profile in whe

246
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,760
running activity which is regular

247
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,760
locomot activity or exercise and we can

248
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,200
see that in all the groups just like we

249
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,480
said but in a quantitative way the mice

250
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
are nocturnal but the activity declines

251
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,279
as they Edge

252
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,959
whereas H the feeding patterns basically

253
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:10,279
H are opposite for instance for the day

254
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,120
eaters so we can also quantify the total

255
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:17,160
intake and we can see that the ad lium

256
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:21,079
um remains like more or less constant

257
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,279
after 400 Days of age and all

258
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,360
importantly all this calorically

259
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,040
restricted groups are eating exactly the

260
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,760
same amount throughout their entire

261
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,000
lifespan and in terms of wheel running

262
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,680
activity we can see that an age related

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,160
decline in wheel running activity that

264
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,320
is happening mainly in the at libitum

265
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,279
and restricted group and all the

266
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,720
calorically restricted groups are able

267
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:49,079
to maintain higher activities at older

268
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,440
ages but the another H aspect that we

269
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,279
measure here is body weight and

270
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,560
basically the body weight regulation

271
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,079
followed the food intake so there is an

272
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,440
age related increase in body weight and

273
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:05,480
a in the control group and after 20

274
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,480
months of age there is um a decline in

275
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,720
body weight and this is very interesting

276
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,680
because if you remember the mice are

277
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,160
actually eating exactly the same amount

278
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,279
yet they are starting to lose weight but

279
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,800
what is important is like for all the

280
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,360
calorically restricted groups they are

281
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,920
able to maintain lean bass throughout

282
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,480
their experiment suggesting that if

283
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,320
there is any difference in lifespan and

284
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,160
it might not be related to body weight

285
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,399
maintenance so the big question is okay

286
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,839
so how long do this mice uh live and

287
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,639
what we were able to find out is that

288
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,480
caloric restriction alone without any

289
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,920
fasting and feeding cycle it's only it's

290
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,680
able to promote is sufficient to promote

291
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,959
lifespan but it does so only by 10% this

292
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,880
was actually very surprising because in

293
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,199
the field we thought that um the

294
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,600
longevity benefits of this protocol it's

295
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:08,800
because of the reduction of on calories

296
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,959
now if instead we also impos a fasting

297
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,360
period even if the food is giving at the

298
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,760
wrong time of the day now the extension

299
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,160
is a little bit better

300
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,320
20% and what was striking for us is that

301
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,320
if now we align all these factors eating

302
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,160
less with a fasting and feeding period

303
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,240
but also the food is given at the normal

304
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,720
active phase of the mice which is their

305
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,000
night time now the extension is

306
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,480
35% so basically what this experiment

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,519
tells us is that the same intervention

308
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,079
in this case caloric restriction can be

309
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:51,199
optimized or boosted its benefits just

310
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,399
by simply um adjusting the time of day

311
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,920
at which we do our

312
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,560
intervention okay so next we also try to

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,320
find out uh

314
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,880
using necropsy trying to find out what

315
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,160
are the lesions that are associated with

316
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,680
this lifespan extension and what

317
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,040
basically what we found is like all the

318
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,440
tissues have the same regardless of the

319
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,600
feeding condition all the tissues have

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,959
the same estop pathology the only

321
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,839
difference that we saw is that the um

322
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:28,199
longest Liv groups the onset of these

323
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,480
pathologies were detected later in life

324
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,399
and something that we also learned from

325
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,240
these H pathology studies is that the

326
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:40,199
liver was the tissue that Harbors most

327
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,199
of the lesions that we found um in the

328
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:46,199
animals that died in the survival

329
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,199
experiment so we looked at the liver for

330
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,639
our followup H studies trying to

331
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,680
understand what could be the molecular

332
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,600
signatures that are associated with this

333
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,639
increasingly um benefit of a timed

334
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,480
caloric restriction

335
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:08,079
and for that we used a gene expression

336
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,399
approach which was basically doing mRNA

337
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,720
sick in the liver but in this case we

338
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,759
did a circadian collection for mRNA sick

339
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,680
basically what we did is we collected

340
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:23,360
samples every four hours throughout two

341
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:26,320
days so and we did so in young and aged

342
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,600
mice so meaning that we had like at

343
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,000
least 24 samples per group

344
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,959
and initially we did differential gene

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,600
expression analysis just to see what are

346
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:41,160
the genes that were up or down regulated

347
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,600
based on the age and what we found in

348
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,160
the control group is most of the genes

349
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,920
were actually AB regulated up to 14% of

350
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,839
the genes were uppr regulated and 4% of

351
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,639
the genes were down

352
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,079
regulated then our Gene onology analysis

353
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:02,120
was very very very clear the genes that

354
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,759
were up Reg were mainly targeting immune

355
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,240
system and inflammation and here we can

356
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,560
see an example of Representative genes

357
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,240
of these on the other hand downregulated

358
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,040
genes relates to metabolism amino acid

359
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,800
lipids or

360
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:23,399
carbohydrates um this was also like very

361
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:27,600
very striking like two specific type of

362
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:30,000
H genes but then our next question was

363
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,079
how so this is in the control group so

364
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,720
what it's happening in all the other

365
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,240
interventions that are promoting

366
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,959
lifespan and basically what we this is

367
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,519
just the summary of what we saw under at

368
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,720
lium at least 18% of the genes are

369
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:49,600
differential expressed between a young

370
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,519
and aged liver and what we can see is

371
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,199
that um the interventions that that are

372
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,880
living the longest they only have four

373
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,360
4% difference between a young and aged

374
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,520
transcriptomic

375
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,280
suggesting that aligning the the the

376
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,839
intervention in this case diary

377
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,880
intervention to the normal active phase

378
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:16,280
of the organism is able to promote

379
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,839
um H basically to maintain a healthier

380
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,520
transcriptomics in the liver and this is

381
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:27,720
actually what correlates exactly with

382
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:29,600
lifespan so we next tried to find out

383
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,600
since we have all the dietary

384
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,520
interventions that have all of them have

385
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,640
caloric restriction we try to paino what

386
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,919
was the effect of actually eating less H

387
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,400
that it's basically um benefiting at

388
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:47,640
least half of the genes that were

389
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:50,799
related to aging 12% of the jeans are

390
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,360
basically rescued by caloric restriction

391
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,280
and this mainly relates to all the genes

392
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,760
that were up regulated in inflammation

393
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,200
Pathways or down regulated in metabolic

394
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,240
pathways such as these two genes that

395
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,919
I'm showing here as representative genes

396
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,039
in addition we found like around like of

397
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:17,520
almost 160 genes that are related to

398
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:21,200
thermogenesis are um able to be rescued

399
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,720
only if there is fasting uh in the

400
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,080
intervention and importantly there is

401
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,919
only 68 genes that can account for this

402
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,240
extra benefit is associated with

403
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,400
circadian alignment of food intake and

404
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,600
i1 beta is actually a poster child of

405
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:46,000
the gene that shows like a very

406
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:48,400
beautiful um time um Trend in which it's

407
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,080
highly up regulated in the at libitum

408
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,039
control group but it's only maintained

409
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,679
at low levels in the groups that are

410
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:59,760
living the longest but now the question

411
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,600
is okay so this is all in terms of

412
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,799
overall gene expression as I mentioned

413
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,440
before one of the advantage of this H

414
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,840
data set is that we collected samples

415
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,799
throughout the day so what if we now

416
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,360
analyze this data in terms of time of

417
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:19,640
day and this is because we are

418
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,760
interested in circadian biologist and

419
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,600
circadian rhythms are um circadian

420
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,520
clocks are distributed throughout the

421
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:32,120
body and Cadian um rhythms

422
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,280
are very important for adaptation to

423
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,880
Earth as a consequence of the earth

424
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:41,080
rotation we have we um mammals and other

425
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,120
species have developed internal timee

426
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,480
keeping mechanisms that allows us to

427
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,640
predict and anticipate recurrent changes

428
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,000
in the environment which is basically

429
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,799
about a

430
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,480
day

431
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:59,200
and these um circadian rhythms can be

432
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,559
span at different levels from molecular

433
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,159
to behavioral levels and the most common

434
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,640
one is feeding and fasting cycle or

435
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,520
sleep wake Cycles but they go all over

436
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,760
until molecular mechanisms and this is

437
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,640
because um circadian clocks are

438
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,559
genetically encoded meaning that there

439
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,400
are transcriptional factors clock and

440
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,559
Bal that are able to activate the

441
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,600
expression of 100 100 of genes

442
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,120
throughout the

443
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,159
genome in specifically it activate they

444
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,159
activate the expression of parent cry

445
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,640
that can act as their own repressors so

446
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,640
this generates a transcriptional

447
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,360
translational negative feedback loop but

448
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,400
what is important that is self- sustain

449
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,720
but what is important about this system

450
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,480
is that it's not only these four genes

451
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,840
that are regulating their own 24-hour

452
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,080
cycle in gene expression but also they

453
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,960
target multiple genes that are

454
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,480
associated with nutrient sensing

455
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:03,480
Pathways for instance cins a MK and M2

456
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:06,360
and on the other hand they also Target

457
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,520
directly main trans key transcription

458
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,440
factors that are Master Regulators of

459
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,919
energy metabolism in the body including

460
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,840
glucose and um lipid

461
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,679
metabolism but there is more so there is

462
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,960
also a lot of connections on how

463
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,799
circadian clocks control multiple

464
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,000
metabolism but in particularly genes

465
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,799
that are related that have been

466
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,440
associated with longevity so one of the

467
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:39,320
um evidence that we knew when we were

468
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,799
doing this experiment is that as we age

469
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,679
as organisms age Circ these 24-hour

470
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,360
cating rhythms damp with aging and

471
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,679
interventions such as caloric

472
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,919
restriction have been thought to promote

473
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,279
uh amplitude of these circadian rhythms

474
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:03,120
and therefore promote

475
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:05,159
longevity we also as as I mentioned we

476
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,720
also knew that these circadian clocks

477
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,640
are autonomous and are genetically

478
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,559
encoded but what is important to this H

479
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,320
experiment is that also dietary um

480
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:22,559
interventions that promote nutrient sens

481
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,919
and Pathways H that can delay aging um

482
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,679
they also have direct interactions with

483
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,960
the Circadian components of the clock

484
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,520
and importantly if we were to look at

485
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,320
genes that have been Associated as to H

486
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,400
favoring or delaying

487
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,919
aging we can also see that sorry that

488
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,039
they undergo um circadian oscillations

489
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,559
and with tissue specific signatures so

490
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,400
the next question is like what is

491
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,360
happening with the circadian rhythms in

492
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,880
all of these conditions that we know

493
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,039
that they are promoting a longevity in

494
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,919
different

495
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,799
ways so again what we always look that

496
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,039
is what is happening in the control

497
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,480
group so basically these are different

498
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,679
time points 0 48 hours each of these are

499
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,880
time points in The Young and the Aged

500
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,720
groups and basically what we can see

501
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,720
right away is that in a completely

502
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:22,080
embased manner the number of cycling

503
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:25,039
genes would H is reduced in the Aged

504
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,919
organism and basically what we can see

505
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,200
also is that at least 15% of the genes

506
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,440
are

507
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,240
suggesting that chances are that if we

508
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,120
measure things in the morning or in the

509
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,279
afternoon we can get different results

510
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,080
and this is not a insignificant number

511
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,520
it's at least 15% of the transcriptomic

512
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,880
in the liver that is exposed to this

513
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,760
daily

514
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,120
variation so next we look and in the

515
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,200
interest of time I'm just going to show

516
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,480
a few of the genes only but basically

517
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,799
what we can see is now when we looked at

518
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,360
the 24-hour profile by plotting the

519
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,760
expression throughout the day what we

520
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:09,640
can see is that the age group shown in

521
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,000
red they have what we call damped

522
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,880
amplitude basically they still oscillate

523
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,039
they always pick at the same time of the

524
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:22,120
day but now the the full change of the

525
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,799
oscillation is reduced but now what

526
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,679
happens with the other conditions that

527
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:27,559
we know that we're leaving the longest

528
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,080
and again in the interest of time I'm

529
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,760
just going to show

530
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,120
the Aged group in the longest Le group

531
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,399
what we can see is that it there is like

532
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,919
robust oscillations that basically

533
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,799
resemble the young group and always the

534
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,640
peak is happening at the same time of

535
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:50,320
the day however the intervention that is

536
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,559
not as efficient in promoting lifespan

537
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,919
even though they are benefiting from

538
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,440
partially from caloric restriction we

539
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:01,480
can see that uh the amplitude is reduced

540
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,480
but also the peak of the expression

541
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,679
happens 12 hours later just because the

542
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,200
food is giving at the time that the mice

543
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,559
is are not supposed to be eating so

544
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,720
basically this intervention which is the

545
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,679
most common intervention that we've seen

546
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,240
in the literature not only reduces the

547
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,480
amplitude but also shifts the amplitude

548
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,320
of the any rhythm that happens

549
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,399
throughout the time and what this is

550
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,840
also telling us is that now it's also

551
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:36,159
very very important that when we are

552
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,279
comparing gene expression in a in

553
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,640
multiple tissues but specifically in the

554
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:44,000
liver if we sample during the morning or

555
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,880
in the afternoon we can actually get an

556
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,919
opposite conclusion so for instance for

557
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,840
these genes and 15% of the genes in the

558
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,640
liver if we were to sample in the

559
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,760
morning we would say like the condition

560
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,000
blue actually up regulates the

561
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,360
expression of this chain

562
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
12 hours later our conclusion would be

563
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,600
the opposite so sampling time is also

564
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,240
very important a factor uh to consider

565
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,760
when we are planning our

566
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,960
experiments and the now our next step is

567
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,880
trying to get like a map of what is

568
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,880
happening in the liver transcriptomic

569
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,760
not only looking at the genes that are

570
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,880
changing through a as we age in overall

571
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,279
levels but also looking at what are the

572
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,159
changes that are happening through

573
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:35,559
throughout the day and H these are the

574
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:39,440
all these genes um organized in term of

575
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,840
um longevity and we can see that uh in

576
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,440
the at libitum control group most of

577
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,600
these genes that regulate metabolism

578
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,440
circadian clocks or even aging related

579
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,039
Pathways they all have D amplitude in

580
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,080
the Aged Group which is shown here as a

581
00:26:54,039 --> 00:27:00,120
dashed line and these groups that are

582
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,240
the the longest lift in which the food

583
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,360
is actually aligned with the normal

584
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,399
Cadian phase of the organism we can see

585
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,440
virally no difference between the young

586
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:18,399
and aged 24hour

587
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:22,000
profile okay so as a summary what we um

588
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,840
found is that H targeting circadian

589
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,640
clock might be a promising intervention

590
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:31,840
that we can H use to promote healthier

591
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,039
and longer lifespan in mice and we Pro

592
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,320
as a proof of principle what we did is

593
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:40,600
we used caloric restriction and we

594
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,480
basically distributed the food intake um

595
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,320
differently throughout the day and one

596
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,600
of the intervention was the winner which

597
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,919
is basically giving the foot during the

598
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,720
normal H behavior of the mouse which is

599
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,600
nighttime and this might be a little bit

600
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,760
difficult for us humans because now we

601
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,399
need to rethink when we are doing the

602
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,159
intervention in the

603
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:06,200
mice um and these changes in lifespan

604
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:09,600
have also been Associated um with

605
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,640
benefits in locomotor activity but also

606
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,600
at molecular level in terms of gene

607
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:18,120
expression because nighttime feeding in

608
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,519
nocturnal animals can promote metabolism

609
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,679
that could always decline with age or

610
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,360
actually prevent age related up

611
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,519
regulation in inflammation Pathways and

612
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:34,039
very importantly for us H promote higher

613
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:36,039
time of day oscillations between um

614
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,960
metabolic

615
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,200
pathways and then let me see yeah I

616
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,519
think I'm good so now also from a

617
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,559
circadian perspective we know that the

618
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,360
Circadian clocks are distributed

619
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,279
throughout the body but not all the

620
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,320
clocks are the same so there is a

621
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,440
central clock that is located in the

622
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,600
brain that mainly responds to light to

623
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,480
changes in light dark cycle

624
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,559
but there are other peripheral clocks

625
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,320
such as the liver which is the most

626
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:10,760
studied H peripheral uh clock that is

627
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,200
mainly H influenced by feeding and

628
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,679
fasting cycle just like we saw before we

629
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,120
change the feeding fasting cycle the

630
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,600
liver H gene expression is going to

631
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,720
change its behave its

632
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,480
expression and what we thought also is

633
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,240
that misalignment Mis line so basically

634
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,640
eating at the wrong time of the day in

635
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,200
which these two environmental cues are

636
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:41,960
in conflict with each other can H

637
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,880
promote um metabolic disorders just

638
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,320
because there is a

639
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,200
miscommunication between these clocks

640
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,640
basically only the clock in the

641
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,039
periphery are going to be shifted to

642
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,720
this misaligned feeding fasting cycle

643
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:59,679
and the question that we had is so okay

644
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,600
so most of the information we know is we

645
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,440
we know because of the liver but what is

646
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,240
happening with all the peripheral clocks

647
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,440
that we know that are distributed in the

648
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,679
rest of the body so to do this we also

649
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,799
used our automated feeder system and in

650
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:19,880
this case we um compare H day versus

651
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:23,360
night feeding with or without caloric

652
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,880
restriction and we all um we looked not

653
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,799
only at the liver but also the

654
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,480
hypothalamus where the central clock

655
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,919
resides and other peripheral tissues

656
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,000
that are very important in maintaining

657
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,080
energy homeostasis and glucose

658
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,399
homeostasis in the

659
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:44,360
body so and here is uh basically this is

660
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,600
um just a control just to show that even

661
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,120
time restricted feeding if we restrict

662
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,399
the food intake to 6 hours H the mice

663
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,399
are H eating less it doesn't matter if

664
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,360
it's day or night just by restricting

665
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,399
the feeding window even though the mice

666
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,240
can eat all they want they would

667
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:04,000
self-impose this caloric restriction

668
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,360
basically this is the opposite of what

669
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,559
we showed earlier if you limits the

670
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,440
calories mice self-impose time

671
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:14,519
restricted feeding the opposite is also

672
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,159
true if you limit the feeding window the

673
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,320
mice at least mice are going to be

674
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:24,360
eating less 80%

675
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,720
less and this lower intake in the time

676
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,919
restricted group is also correlates with

677
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,320
body weights but then what was important

678
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,600
for us is also what is happening in

679
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,320
terms of gene expression in all these

680
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:42,080
metabolic tissues so for this we started

681
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:45,120
uh doing um qpcr and we picked two of

682
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,960
the genes that we know that have very

683
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,600
beautiful oscillations throughout the

684
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,399
day which are DVP and rever Alpha

685
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,519
basically what we can see is that for

686
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,919
the control groups the night ears we can

687
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,200
see they all have beautiful oscillation

688
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,159
and Peak around 8 hours after the lights

689
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,159
are

690
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:09,120
off but the day eers are completely

691
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,480
shifted now the peak happens 12 hours

692
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,200
later which is basically at the time

693
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,159
that they are not

694
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,399
eating so this was the liver we knew for

695
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,559
the liver so this was our control why

696
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:25,159
the Theos tissue the same daytime

697
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:28,399
feeding would shift 12 hours the 24hour

698
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:31,519
profile of these jeans but what was very

699
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,880
interesting for us is that the prown OS

700
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,360
tisue remained completely insensitive to

701
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,240
this feeding time so these genes remain

702
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,559
beautifully oscillating but at the same

703
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,360
phase meaning that they would still pick

704
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,080
at the same time of day and this was

705
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:52,320
exactly what we knew that was happening

706
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:55,480
in the hypothalamus so what this T told

707
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,480
us is that daytime feeding not only

708
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,960
uncouples rhythmic G

709
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,440
between the central clock in the

710
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,559
hypothalamus and the liver but also can

711
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,840
cause a internal misalignment between

712
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:09,840
peripheral

713
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,960
clocks so we became very interested

714
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,559
about this and we looked at other gen

715
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,480
that are um important for the physiology

716
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:22,559
of the Prados tissue and we looked at um

717
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,960
genes that are H that are related to

718
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:29,440
thermogenesis and lipid homeostasis and

719
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,880
we can see that some of them were

720
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,360
actually completely insensitive to the

721
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,159
feeding

722
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,639
time such just like the clock core clock

723
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,399
genes in the brown

724
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:47,880
depos however other genes that are

725
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:51,760
mainly metabolic seem to be shifting so

726
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,080
this was also telling us that daytime

727
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,440
feeding basically eating at the wrong

728
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:01,639
time of the day in the organism can

729
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:06,120
cause like a traumatic um misalignment

730
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:09,679
even within an specific tissue in where

731
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,000
some genes are able to readjust their

732
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,240
24-hour profile uh to the new feeding

733
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,159
fasting Cycles whereas the other one are

734
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,599
unable so we are creating this

735
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:25,800
uncoupling that could potentially be

736
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:29,919
influencing um metabolic H

737
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,639
disruption um so again this was qpcr so

738
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,839
we said okay what is happening

739
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:40,480
genomewide so for this we compareed a

740
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:43,079
mRNA sick across all the 24 48 Hours

741
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,839
sampling between the control group and

742
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,720
the C day which was most different one

743
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,359
and what we can see in this uh

744
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,240
24hour in this what we call frequency

745
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:58,079
plot what we can see is like most of the

746
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,960
jeans 18% almost 18% of the jeans are

747
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,560
oscillating in the aditum control even a

748
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,560
little bit more than the

749
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,440
liver and what here what we are seeing

750
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,200
is that most of the genes that were

751
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,240
oscillating would actually have its peak

752
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,920
of

753
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,200
expression 8 hours after the light

754
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,520
during the normal rest phase of the

755
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,839
organism however when we do daytime

756
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,680
feeding we can see that the they still

757
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:31,280
have this

758
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,480
most of like many genes are

759
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,119
still picking at ct8 but then half of

760
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,800
the other genes now are picking 12 hours

761
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,680
later what means that this internal

762
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,440
misalignment that we were seeing with

763
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,160
few genes that we saw before it was

764
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,319
actually something more

765
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,920
widespread and when we looked at uh gene

766
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:57,240
expression um geneontology analysis of

767
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,400
the genes that are cycling in the Prados

768
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,599
tissue

769
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,240
uh what was very interesting for us is

770
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,200
that even within um each Pathways we

771
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,240
could find jeans that were completely

772
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,599
insensitive to the feeding time we can

773
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,440
see that both day A Time feeding and the

774
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,160
control at lium have exactly the same

775
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:25,119
profile whereas others have completely

776
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,680
shifted and this is true not only for

777
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:33,319
this pathway but basically every pathway

778
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:37,040
way that um that is cycling in the pros

779
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:39,480
show this a split dual Behavior so now

780
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,079
we still have a lot of questions as to

781
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,560
what this is happening and one of them

782
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,319
is of course is like if these internal

783
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:52,119
splits uh in the Prados tissue rhythms

784
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:54,560
caused by misaligned feeding can be

785
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,560
actually H contributing to this

786
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:02,680
detrimental H Health toll that we see

787
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,720
when we eat at the wrong time of day so

788
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:10,560
basically this is like a little summary

789
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:13,359
so my are nocturnal so we can um adjust

790
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,800
their feeding time when we so mice are

791
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,200
nocturnal meaning that they normally eat

792
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,480
during the night time but now if we are

793
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,359
forcing the mice to eat at the wrong

794
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,359
time of the day when we go to the Animal

795
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:29,200
Facility and we do our experiments like

796
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:33,960
really during the day day time this can

797
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,079
be um causing an unexpected changes not

798
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,480
only in Behavior like we saw before but

799
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,200
also at molecular level by shifting few

800
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,800
not all of the rhythmic genes that we

801
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,640
are expecting to

802
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:52,200
see so with this a a conclusion for this

803
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,800
is that the timing matters but basically

804
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,319
it's important to look what are the

805
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,240
tissues when are we doing the

806
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:01,280
intervention and when are we sampling

807
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,599
to keep all of this in consideration to

808
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,640
H try to really deeply understand what

809
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,119
is the effect of um an intervention on a

810
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,480
particular Gene of

811
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,800
interest and with

812
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,920
that H this is basically a followup

813
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,520
experiment now what we are actively

814
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,680
trying to look for is like whether this

815
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,520
internal split in the brosious is

816
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,480
because there are two cell types one

817
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,200
that is responding to feeding and one

818
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,800
that is responding to the local clock or

819
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,560
if instead there are different

820
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,599
transcription factors that can

821
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,240
differentially regulate the expression

822
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,800
of those

823
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,720
genes and this is just to give like a

824
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:48,160
larger perspective as to why H do we

825
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,920
care about all of this during the aging

826
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:56,079
process is that we know that we are

827
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,440
living longer than ever and we also know

828
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:03,079
that now aging has

829
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,599
exposed has been um shown that aging is

830
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,880
a major risk factor for basically

831
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,960
developing many of the chronic diseases

832
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,960
and there is a lot of efforts um

833
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,599
suggesting that basically we are like at

834
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,240
least one 30% of our life living

835
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,920
unhealthy so now there is a lot of

836
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,359
effort from the science H scientific

837
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,599
Community but also from the Health Care

838
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:34,720
system a lot of effort put into how can

839
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:38,359
we actually reduce this um amount of

840
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,880
time that we are unhealthy and our H

841
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:44,400
goal in the Circadian biology of Aging

842
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,480
unit is we are going to try to

843
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,560
understand circadian biology of aging

844
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,079
and try to promote um healthier and

845
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,240
longer life spans by targeting these

846
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,480
circadian

847
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:02,880
clocks and basically we are going to H

848
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,839
look at many uh different aspects from

849
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,920
multiomics to behavioral readouts trying

850
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:13,480
to identify which could be Cadian

851
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,319
markers that we can use to track aging

852
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:20,480
progression and if we can understand how

853
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:23,960
the clock H system ages whether we can

854
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,920
fix it and hopefully reverse or at least

855
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,560
delay a whole marks of aging and of

856
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:34,680
course most of um the studies normally

857
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:38,160
Target one population usually c57 black

858
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,079
6j mice but the question is like whether

859
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,520
we are able to find interventions that

860
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,920
are actually working uh not just from

861
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,440
one specific strain but also that art

862
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,960
can be universally um used in females in

863
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,040
different genetic backgrounds and

864
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,280
hopefully H in

865
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,160
humans and this is our team at the

866
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,680
Cadian biology of Aging unit we just

867
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,319
started

868
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:11,839
um eight month ago and we are basically

869
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:15,040
trying to tackle using Mouse models and

870
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,640
hopefully humans eventually H trying to

871
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:22,119
tackle very broad questions for instance

872
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,800
how that do circadian clocks age and

873
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:30,240
contribute to the onset of

874
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:33,119
um basically virally any um chronic

875
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,800
disease that is associated with aging

876
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,920
whether we can find biomarkers in blood

877
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,319
or in different tissues and what it's

878
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,280
happening when we are doing intervention

879
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:46,880
either dietary or phac or a combination

880
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:52,119
with pharmacological interventions and

881
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,920
we can track um the entire duration of a

882
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:57,440
um a

883
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:01,119
lifespan and hopefully in the future not

884
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,400
too long from now uh we are going to try

885
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:09,319
to see whether this the basic science

886
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:15,200
that we see in mice it's also applicable

887
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:17,280
to humans and makis and this is because

888
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,040
here it would be very very important to

889
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,280
consider actually how mice are nocturnal

890
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:28,480
and we are diona so with that I would

891
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:32,000
like to thank all of you but also my

892
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,880
mentors um Joe and Carla because that's

893
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,200
when I decided that yes we could

894
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,200
actually do big big big H experiments

895
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,440
take advantage of all the resources and

896
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:48,760
this massive project and yeah that's it

897
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,760
thank you

898
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,839
all thank you very much um so we're

899
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,720
going to go on to the Q&A portion so

900
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:59,720
Cynthia too asked a question have you

901
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,319
had a chance to see how different

902
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,720
circadium Rhythm affects body

903
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:07,559
composition clean versus fat

904
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,640
Mass Yes actually yeah I didn't include

905
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:13,440
it here but yes um basically we don't

906
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,400
see an effect we only see an effect of

907
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:21,280
caloric restriction so all calorically

908
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,119
restricted group have less um fat Mass

909
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,640
compared to the ad libitum but there is

910
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:31,760
no difference between um CR groups that

911
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,760
kind explain lifespan

912
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,240
differences yeah I think that answered

913
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,119
question I had a question myself

914
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,720
actually so

915
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:46,800
um have you like have you also monitored

916
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,400
um metrics in blood like uh LDL

917
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,359
cholesterol like these things might go

918
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,040
like your metabolism might not function

919
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,240
as well because you're under stress from

920
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,000
not sleeping so is that really uh

921
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,240
something you can measure

922
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,160
yeah so we did not measure col so we do

923
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,440
we do have measurements of glucose um

924
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,880
that's the only rout that we have and

925
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:14,359
hormones so we didn't do any lipid

926
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:17,960
um panel for the blood um what we know

927
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:21,559
so overall levels again glucose is the

928
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,720
same so the CR groups have lower glucose

929
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,800
levels in circulation that they ad leave

930
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,520
but there is no difference between the

931
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,000
them when we looked at the overall

932
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,240
levels but now when we looked at the

933
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,119
24hour profile we can see that it's the

934
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,559
opposite

935
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,920
um glucose levels are slightly elevated

936
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:45,800
when the organism is

937
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:49,800
eating um same thing happens even more

938
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:52,640
dramatically with insulin and leptin

939
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,599
levels as soon as the might switched

940
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,280
their feeding Behavior whenever they are

941
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,960
forced to eat at the wrong time time of

942
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:05,520
the day the 24hour profile it actually

943
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,839
shifts you had a question from an

944
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,920
anonymous attendee from your liver RNA

945
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,400
seek were there any Pathways that were

946
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,200
affected by aging that actually

947
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,200
improveed by

948
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:22,119
ciria if there is any pathway that we're

949
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,160
actually uh yes so any Pathways that

950
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:28,240
were affected by aging that were

951
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,040
improved by Circa or

952
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,400
yes

953
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:37,440
so yes and this was mainly related to

954
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,319
immune function also like a further

955
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,680
Improvement on of immune

956
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:45,520
function so that that also corresponded

957
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,800
to like reduction in inflammation and

958
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,800
inflammation

959
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,800
biomarkers

960
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,119
yes

961
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,760
um did you also are you also planning a

962
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,960
looking at massolution signatures as the

963
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,000
interface between environment and gene

964
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,240
expression yes so actually we did and

965
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,559
now I do have mutilation clocks uh in

966
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,640
all of these groups and again what we

967
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:16,000
can see is the age prediction for the

968
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,000
calorically restricted group is younger

969
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,720
than the atli but I don't see difference

970
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,760
between the C RS among them but now what

971
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,559
I'm trying to do is actually since I

972
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:31,599
have DNA methylation and gene

973
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,319
expression now trying to match these two

974
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:38,960
and see whether I can find like what are

975
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:41,119
the minimum number of genes or sides

976
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,559
that can actually account for these

977
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,559
differences very good

978
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,240
question do you expect to see I used to

979
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,680
work in a methylation lab so do you

980
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,160
expect to see um kind of like a overlap

981
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,640
or convergence between the genes that

982
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,839
are methylated and the ones that have

983
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,839
differential expression

984
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:08,079
yes especially for those

985
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:11,640
um that are jeans that are down

986
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,280
regulated with aging so I think like in

987
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,200
this case might be more for the

988
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:20,240
metabolic genes but I'm not sure for the

989
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:24,079
immune function genes which are the ones

990
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,079
that usually pop up

991
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,000
so any other questions so um I assume

992
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,240
you're going to do this at the Single

993
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,119
Cell level so you're going single cell

994
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,079
sequencing in different tissues of the

995
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,520
brain and maybe like the liver and some

996
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,520
other

997
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:45,200
tissues yeah so for this I

998
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:48,960
um yes so I'm trying to

999
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,480
select what are the tissues that are

1000
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,400
going to be more

1001
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,040
significant because of course a single

1002
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,640
cell is very very expensive and I also

1003
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,200
want to do two time points at least 12

1004
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,119
hours apart because I'm not only

1005
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,559
interested in like changes in overall

1006
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:11,920
but actually how the our ability to tell

1007
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:14,760
time changes as we age so yeah I think

1008
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,440
like yeah definitely looking at the

1009
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,640
brain liver we know a lot about the

1010
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:24,040
liver but maybe another more interesting

1011
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,800
Gene and tissue would be white fat and

1012
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,839
brown fat because you know we start

1013
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,599
multiplying the number of tissues with

1014
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:34,440
time points and yeah I think it's going

1015
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,599
to be interesting to know this at single

1016
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,160
cell

1017
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:41,079
11 yeah it is expensive and when you do

1018
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,400
lot the tissues it compounds very

1019
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:47,280
quickly the the the price tie comes up

1020
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,520
it's super

1021
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,079
interesting um if we have any other

1022
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,400
questions we can take now if you can

1023
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,520
post your questions in the Q&A so it's

1024
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,680
very interesting and very very relevant

1025
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,680
it's also in the media a lot caloric

1026
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,680
restriction for um

1027
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,280
longevity

1028
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,640
um so is a plan to use a single cell

1029
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,480
sequ thing and also like metabolic

1030
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,359
markers are you going to dig deeper into

1031
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,960
the pathways and specific cell types to

1032
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:30,480
figure out if um uh you know if there's

1033
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,480
a a certain biomarker or cell type that

1034
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,480
is more

1035
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:37,960
susceptible to to caloric

1036
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,240
restriction right so I think like one of

1037
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,799
the aspect and taking advantage of being

1038
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,520
here at NIH that I can do like

1039
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:48,680
longitudinal um studies we are actually

1040
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,880
setting up a circadian

1041
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:54,599
behavioral um

1042
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,720
room um it's yes trying to do like

1043
00:49:54,599 --> 00:50:01,520
longit static with more

1044
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:04,200
biomarkers and yes collecting tissues

1045
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:08,079
for single cell like

1046
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:12,040
U yeah the the question I had was um do

1047
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:14,680
you think a 12h hour sampling has enough

1048
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:18,400
resolution to pick up these

1049
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:22,880
fluctuations no to pick up 24 circadian

1050
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:26,760
rhythms definitely not but to pick up um

1051
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,400
information on things that are different

1052
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,960
throughout the

1053
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:35,520
day yes but definitely is not enough

1054
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:38,079
even four hours is actually the limit of

1055
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,640
the resolution that we need to detect

1056
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,640
circadian

1057
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,240
rhythms so uh if no one else has any

1058
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,040
questions we are coming up to the hour

1059
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,400
thank you very much once again for this

1060
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,040
very interesting

1061
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,040
talk okay thank you
