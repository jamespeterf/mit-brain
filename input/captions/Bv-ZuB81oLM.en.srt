1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,800
Um so I want to thank ILP for inviting

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,519
me to talk about Lincoln Laboratory um

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,800
in its 75 years of supporting national

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:23,199
security through industry engagement. Um

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,760
so we uh strive to create as it says

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,720
prototype and deliver and that really

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,279
involves engaging with industry in a

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
significant way. So this discussion is

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,000
is about that engagement and I

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,440
understand um you know there might be an

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,239
opportunity for questions but if you

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,079
have any questions as I move forward

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,120
please feel free to ask.

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,399
Okay. So a little bit of history about

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,160
Lincoln Lab. So Lincoln Lab was actually

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,960
begun or its inception uh came with the

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,600
concurrence of the second world war. Um

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:05,920
the allies uh needed a way uh to better

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,479
monitor aircraft and yubot um and they

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,880
were looking for radar technology to be

21
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,680
developed to help with this monitoring.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,880
So um Tizzard in England had come to the

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,479
United States with a secret technology

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:27,280
uh called a cavity mag uh magnetron. And

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,320
this cavity magnetron um was basically

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,280
able to use high power ultra

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,920
highfrequency radar um in a way that

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,200
would allow antennas to be shrunk and

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,560
put on aircraft so that you could detect

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,159
a yubot surfacing or aircraft coming in

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,640
the air uh from uh foreign uh space,

32
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,360
right? And so the amazing thing is they

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,399
had this capability but their industrial

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,439
base was decimated by the war. So the

35
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,159
partnership between the allies allowed

36
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,240
the United States to bring together

37
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,079
academia and industry to help create a

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,720
solution that really helped turn the

39
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,480
tide on the war. The um NA NDRC, the

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
National Defense Research Committee

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,280
decided that to help uh create a

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,319
prototype uh for the cavity magnet

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,480
magnetron um they would create a

44
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,879
laboratory at MIT that would include

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,959
academicians, researchers, and members

46
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,280
of industry to help develop this

47
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,640
technology. And so that's how the MIT

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,879
RAD lab or radiation lab was born. The

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
RAD lab was called radiation lab. And I

50
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
never knew this until I came for this

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
talk because I was like, what does

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
radiation have to do with radar? But in

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,040
fact it was a misnomer and it was an

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
intentional misnomer to I guess help

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,879
think help uh kind of foster the idea

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,640
that the lab was uh working on nuclear

57
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,360
energy when really we were working on

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,959
detection. So the lab was established in

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,400
temporary housing at MIT uh in about in

60
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,720
the 40s. Um, it employed over 4,000

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,480
people. And as they were developing this

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,800
technology for national security, they

63
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,720
invited industry to help with the

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,280
manufacturing and the scaling of that

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,599
technology. So RCA, Westinghouse, all of

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,200
these large companies came to learn

67
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,840
about the technology, to learn how to

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,680
make it, and then to productize it. This

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,840
really helped turn the tide of the war.

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,799
By the end of World War II, 50% of all

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,959
radar monitoring was based on this MIT

72
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,599
design. So that's how we got started. Um

73
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,720
after the war was over, the lab was

74
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,560
dismantled. But with the rise of Soviet

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,959
nuclear power, the United States decided

76
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,400
that it needed additional assistance

77
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,480
with surveillance. And so they came to

78
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,319
the secretary of the air force came to

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:09,360
MIT and asked would MIT help support

80
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,760
national security again and MIT said yes

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,959
but the nature of our work public

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,880
education you saw very global amazing

83
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,759
place right uh may not be the best uh

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,320
environment to hold classified

85
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,919
discussions about national security. So

86
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,880
MIT built uh right next to Hanscom Air

87
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,320
Force Base in Lexington, Massachusetts,

88
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,479
which is why we're called Lincoln,

89
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
right? Because we're in Lexington. I

90
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
never understood that we border

91
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,960
Lexington and Lincoln, but anyway, um

92
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,639
I'm not from Massachusetts. Uh so it's

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,000
Lincoln Laboratory because of its

94
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,680
location in Lexington. and we are an

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,400
organization here um dedicated to

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,720
developing advanced technology solutions

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,000
to support national security. We've had

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,840
se almost 75 years of this activity and

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
most of this activity has been

100
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,720
successful because we've been able to

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,960
partner with industry. So you can see

102
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
some of the accomplish accomplishments

103
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,120
over time. I'm just going to point out

104
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,160
one of them, the 193 optical lithography

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,280
technology that was developed by Lincoln

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,440
um in the 90s. So in the 90s the idea

107
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,000
was in order to make a leap in micro

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,600
electronics we needed to move into

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,919
X-rays. So Lincoln decided that might

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,080
not be the way to go that in order to

111
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,039
get the smaller feature size we should

112
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,360
stick to deep UV and that's what we did

113
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,560
and Lincoln developed a much smaller

114
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,160
feature- sized approach to micro

115
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,120
electronics and the integrated circuit

116
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,960
chip and we did it in coll we led an

117
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,759
industry collaboration that included IBM

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,680
and Corning and all of the other analog

119
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,880
devices all of the traditional companies

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,919
that you would think would be involved

121
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,320
olved in this endeavor were part of this

122
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,960
collaboration. We worked hand in hand

123
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,199
and really created a kind of next

124
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,680
generation chip that is still being used

125
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:13,280
today in much of the IoT devices that

126
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,919
you use. So um our success is made

127
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,919
possible through our ability to engage

128
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,000
with industry.

129
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,720
So this is a kind of an overview of what

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
Lincoln looks like. Um, as I said,

131
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
Lincoln is right next to Hanscom Air

132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Force Base, which makes parking really

133
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,199
difficult if there's an Air Force event,

134
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,680
but um, not a problem for you. Uh, so

135
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,919
um, we are in Lexington, Massachusetts,

136
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
but we do have other locations across

137
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,960
the United States. Uh, one in Westford,

138
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,120
Massachusetts, another in the Marshall

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,240
Islands, as well as in uh, Nevada. The

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,520
um Milstone telescope in Westford,

141
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:59,319
Massachusetts was the first telescope to

142
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,319
see Sputnik go over the skies in 1957.

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,599
Sorry. Go. So, Lincoln, as I might have

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
mentioned or the slides might have

145
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,479
mentioned, is an FFRDC.

146
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,800
Lincoln is a federally funded research

147
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,720
and development center.

148
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,360
MIT has a contract with the Air Force to

149
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,800
run this FFRDC.

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:27,280
Um, what MIT does as a service to the

151
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,319
nation um is run this in a at a kind of

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,120
benefit to the public. We do this in the

153
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,080
public interest and we are very careful

154
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,160
to uh keep to a strict conflict of

155
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
interest policy with respect to our

156
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
industry engagement but that does not

157
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,759
prevent us uh from engaging with

158
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:50,319
industry. Um so what we don't do is we

159
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,280
don't compete with industry in any way.

160
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,680
We don't manufacture products. um we

161
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,080
support the development of new

162
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,919
technology when that technology doesn't

163
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,039
exist in the commercial sector. That's

164
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,919
very important to us um to think about

165
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,840
uh us not competing with industry.

166
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,800
Examining whether the commercial sector

167
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,400
has a technology solution already that

168
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
the federal government needs. If it

169
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,479
does, we will encourage the federal

170
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,240
government to adopt that existing

171
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,360
commercial technology solution.

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,840
So um

173
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,400
these are some of the facilities at

174
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,879
Lincoln. Uh we have a number of advanced

175
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,159
technology facilities that are available

176
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,440
to us companies to use on an as

177
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,800
available basis at cost.

178
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,719
um the we use what's called a test

179
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,200
agreement that would allow a company to

180
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,760
come in and say listen I need you to

181
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,800
process this particular thing or we need

182
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,560
to do this experiment and in that

183
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,320
fashion no intellectual property is

184
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,959
generated we're just following a

185
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,920
protocol and the service that we're

186
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,480
providing is to the US economy to help

187
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,560
us businesses get access to advanced

188
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,600
technologies that they may not otherwise

189
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,600
have um so Some examples of these

190
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,160
facilities include the Strive Center,

191
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,440
which is a biomechanical

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,160
um uh

193
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
infrastructure that reproduces any kind

194
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,399
of environment that you would be

195
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,399
interested in reproducing from um

196
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,760
climbing a mountain to what it would be

197
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,920
like to stand on a a ship to swimming.

198
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Right? So that that's an environmental

199
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,720
uh reconstruction

200
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,440
um facility. Uh we have a supercomputing

201
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,399
center. We have a hanger that was given

202
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,480
to us by the Air Force where we can look

203
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,600
at autonomous um flights and drones and

204
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,399
and track their capabilities over time.

205
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,640
Uh we have a micro electronics fab that

206
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,959
we can use to help small businesses with

207
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,120
their needs. Um and we have an RF

208
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,399
facility.

209
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,160
So what does Lincoln really do? So what

210
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,640
we do is we look at uh America's

211
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,920
technology gaps, our needs and national

212
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,959
security and we help understand,

213
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,560
articulate and develop solutions for

214
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,040
that technology gap. um primarily by

215
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,360
understanding what the commercial sector

216
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,519
has to offer and if it doesn't have

217
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
anything to offer to work with the

218
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,440
commercial sector to bring that advanced

219
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,320
technology solution needed by the

220
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,440
federal government to the war fighter to

221
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,040
the defense uh industrial base and for

222
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,640
the benefit of the nation and so as an

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,880
FFRDC

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,399
um that is an R&D FFRDC we are capable

225
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,640
of rapidly prototyping a solution in a

226
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:54,079
matter of months to field and to

227
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:59,279
collaboratively develop with industry a

228
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:01,120
solution for the DoD bow uh base.

229
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,440
So

230
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,279
this is just an example of something

231
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,360
that we did um in Iraq and Afghanistan.

232
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,079
You can imagine when there was an

233
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,200
immediate need to understand kind of the

234
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,800
the the physical clearance of space and

235
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,480
so we needed uh the ability um to

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:27,680
monitor uh land uh at it you know at at

237
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,160
great distances. So um the

238
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,920
federal agency reached out and said hey

239
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,800
we need a root clearance system and we

240
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,200
need it now. And so what Lincoln did was

241
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,959
it worked with a couple of companies to

242
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
say, "Hey, what technologies do you

243
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,760
have? How can we accommodate the

244
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,480
technologies that you currently have so

245
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,959
that we can then support this fielded

246
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,800
need?" So we worked with these companies

247
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,680
collaboratively. We came up with a

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,600
solution and we tested that solution in

249
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,560
the field setting within nine months of

250
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,120
the ask. And after we developed the

251
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,040
fielded solution, the companies then

252
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,880
moved forward to create uh more units

253
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,720
for the federal government because we're

254
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,720
not allowed to manufacture products.

255
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,480
So um another thing that we uh do is

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,680
obviously we we look at um kind of

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
surveillance and one of the kind of

258
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,200
surveillance we look at is uh

259
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,279
atmospheric and so we uh with NASA uh

260
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,560
have developed technologies to look at

261
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,760
the atmosphere the water content the air

262
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,639
the turbulence and and uh monitor storm

263
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,440
development. So NASA had a storm

264
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,839
development satellite um it was called

265
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
ATMS advanced technology microwave

266
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,839
sounder that obviously used microwaves

267
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,279
for the detection. This satellite was

268
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,880
over 2,000 kilograms in weight. It was a

269
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,279
huge bus. And so in order to get the

270
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,320
kind of accuracy that you would need for

271
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,560
storm prediction, you need a you need a

272
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,120
lot of satellites and you need them to

273
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,839
make that rotation around the Earth with

274
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,000
great frequency. And so NASA said,

275
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,480
"Listen, how can we work together to

276
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,120
improve our surveillance capabilities of

277
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,959
weather?" NASA reached out to Lincoln.

278
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:24,639
And Lincoln took that tw 2,000 kilogram

279
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,880
satellite and shrunk it down to 5.4 kg,

280
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,480
something that you can really make lots

281
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,920
of to then have repeated flights over

282
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,760
the earth to understand global weather.

283
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,200
So when we did this, this is amazing,

284
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,560
right? But we're not actually going to

285
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,399
make uh hundreds of satellites for

286
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,040
anybody or anything that we don't

287
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,680
produce. Um and so we said how can we

288
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,160
tech transition this technology? So we

289
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,320
went to look out for a partner. The

290
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,360
partner that we found that had the most

291
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,000
immediate and compelling interest was a

292
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,160
weather data company was a data service

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,720
company and the data service company had

294
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,600
no engineering capability. But they said

295
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,040
listen our interest is in this space to

296
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,519
provide intelligent data uh for the

297
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,399
United States and for our customers to

298
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,920
make decisions for business support. And

299
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,800
so we thought that was a good

300
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,600
partnership. So we worked with a company

301
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,399
called tomorrow.io IO which is again a

302
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,440
data company um not an engineering

303
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,600
company and we said how can we partner

304
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,720
to make this technology something that

305
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,560
you can use not just for the benefit of

306
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,560
your consumer base but for the benefit

307
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,600
of the United States in its

308
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,279
understanding of global weather patterns

309
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,160
and so we partnered with tomorrow.io IO

310
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,360
um to create a right now a nine

311
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,839
satellite constellation that has between

312
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,959
a 60 and 30 minute revisit rate. Um that

313
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,440
company has um again was a data service

314
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,519
company. So the question is how do you

315
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,480
work with a data service company to

316
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,519
provide them engineering support. So we

317
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,399
entered into a creda uh commercial

318
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,440
research and development agreement and

319
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,360
we transferred that technology both in a

320
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,160
license agreement that allows them

321
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,240
intellectual property access right and

322
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,480
gives gives them the rights to use the

323
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
technology but for a data company that's

324
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,320
really not going to be enough. They need

325
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
to be able to understand how to

326
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,760
recapitulate that technology from an

327
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,920
engineering perspective. So, we worked

328
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,519
with them and handinhand with their

329
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,639
subcontractors

330
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,440
and their vendors. Um, we said, "Listen,

331
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,120
this is kind of what the supply list you

332
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,000
you would you should need. These are the

333
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,760
suppliers you should probably use. Let's

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,600
get into relationships with these

335
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:55,360
companies. Let's show them how to make

336
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,399
one and then we will be there when they

337
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,560
make the next one." Um, and so the

338
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,519
technology is transferred from our

339
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,160
making it to their making it all while

340
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,959
being uh carefully watched and helped

341
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,759
and supported by Lincoln's activities.

342
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,959
So this is how we imagine working with

343
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,440
industry. It's not enough for us to say,

344
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,680
"Hey, you need intellectual property

345
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,399
access. We're giving this to you. you go

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,519
off and whether you make it or you break

347
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,360
it or you succeed or you fail, it's not

348
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,800
our concern. That really doesn't help um

349
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,320
us as an institution supporting national

350
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,199
security

351
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,279
and looking for the commercial sector to

352
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,920
provide advanced technology solutions

353
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,560
for the nation if we allow those

354
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,839
companies to kind of not have that

355
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,279
technology transfer support. So what we

356
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,440
did was we entered into a a crater. We

357
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,199
entered into a license agreement. We

358
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
entered into a technology support

359
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,880
agreement. All of which allowed the

360
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,440
company to transfer that technology

361
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,920
successfully and then if they wanted to

362
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,920
work on V2.

363
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,799
Uh so another example um came when the

364
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,079
army uh was looking for a solution for

365
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:22,000
uncontrollable like deaths on the field

366
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:25,039
through hemorrhaging. So 90% of

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,200
hemorrhage related deaths on the field

368
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:33,600
can be prevented if you can catheterize

369
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,600
the wounded and you can and usually this

370
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
in a deep vein or deep artery. It's

371
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,080
really hard to do in a fielded

372
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,720
situation. Uh but if you can find that

373
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,640
deep vein or deep uh artery and you can

374
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,039
catheterize it, you can have a

375
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,679
therapeutic intervention that 90% of the

376
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,320
time will save the patient. So the army

377
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,679
was looking for surgical interventions

378
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,640
that would not require a clinical

379
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,840
setting. And so they came to Lincoln and

380
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,480
Lincoln used um ultra their ultrasound

381
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,200
technology and their AI technology to

382
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,720
create a solution set which is about as

383
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,080
big as you see there um that can

384
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,039
literally examine a person's leg,

385
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,799
determine where the vein or the artery

386
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,400
is, image it, and then find the exact

387
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:27,600
location to enter u the the catheter.

388
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,320
and it will tell you as the user of the

389
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,360
device that they found the vein or the

390
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,720
the artery and you literally push the

391
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,919
button to allow the catheter to engage.

392
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,640
It's an amazing technology that has

393
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,600
immediate benefits obviously on the

394
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,240
field but it also has immediate benefits

395
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,919
in you know domestic situations outside

396
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,880
of war.

397
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,559
So having you know created this

398
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,000
technology we were looking for a

399
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,360
solution set to get this productized and

400
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,360
uh we had a spin out of Lincoln and MGB

401
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,640
that was interested in developing this

402
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,919
technology show we're transitioning that

403
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,600
technology to the company again very

404
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,520
carefully through a technology support

405
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,520
agreement through SBIRS and STRs to

406
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,520
really help them recreate that

407
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,960
technology successfully.

408
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,840
So um this is you know we have seven

409
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,880
patents actually we have more than that

410
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,919
we have more than nine disclosures

411
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,480
so it's quite an IP portfolio uh but

412
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,320
again it's not about the licensing it

413
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,160
really is about ensuring that our

414
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,720
commercial partner can take that

415
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,440
investment of the American taxpayer and

416
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:48,080
make it real.

417
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,559
show another example of how um I want to

418
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,720
make sure I know it's it says 517 but I

419
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,720
guess that means five minutes left so

420
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,559
I'll make it quick. Um so another

421
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,840
amazing example of a technology

422
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,039
developed um at MIT and at Lincoln is

423
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,919
optical coherence tomography. Every time

424
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,400
you go to an optometrist and you put

425
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,919
your chin on the little holder and they

426
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:16,000
take a picture that's OCT. one person uh

427
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,559
one every second gets this assay, right?

428
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,720
Um so this was developed really by an

429
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,200
individual who was working on satellite

430
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,120
communication technology

431
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:32,720
and so he saw an application space in uh

432
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:35,679
doing optical um you know resolution and

433
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,919
uh moved ahead. Uh he and his MIT

434
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,400
partners started multiple companies.

435
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,880
They did spinouts. these were acquired

436
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,880
and this technology is available right

437
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,159
now uh for all of us. So really amazing.

438
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,360
Um we do a lot of spinouts. Uh we do

439
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,880
about two a year um and so we're very

440
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,159
accustomed to working with small

441
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,000
businesses and supporting their um

442
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,000
development of advanced technology

443
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,159
solutions for uh the DOW base. And so

444
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,080
these are the ways we work with

445
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:13,520
industry. Um we have just started a new

446
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,720
technology transfer office um whose goal

447
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,640
is to support getting that technology

448
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,880
into the hands of companies so that they

449
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,320
can manufacture and support the DOW

450
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,200
base. Um we do that through exclusive

451
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,480
licensing or non-exclusive licensing to

452
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,400
a company. Um but we we do want to make

453
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,559
sure that we support the government's

454
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,640
interests. So when we do the licensing

455
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,679
we will be thinking about what the

456
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,240
taxpayer and the US uh citizen is going

457
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,360
to best benefit from um as a result of

458
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:50,480
this licensing activity. Uh as I said we

459
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,520
do which are our novel R&D contract to

460
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,840
support collaborating with industry in

461
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,039
developing new technology. We do that

462
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,840
all the time. Um most of the time the

463
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,720
technology space will have a national

464
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,559
security implication but you can see

465
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,000
that if you're working in satellite

466
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:13,440
communications and you can develop OCT

467
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,440
the the space is pretty broad for

468
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,000
creating new advanced technologies with

469
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,360
industry that could have a huge impact.

470
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,039
Um, we also, and this is I think really

471
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,840
underutilized,

472
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,880
that anything that is supported by the

473
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,520
federal government is available for the

474
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,159
federal government to use

475
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,760
and thereby any company working for the

476
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,280
federal government under a federal

477
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,039
program for free. So, if you are

478
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,039
proposing a grant to the federal

479
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,960
government and you see that Lincoln has

480
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,720
the capability, there's no need to

481
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,559
recreate it. There's no need to license

482
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,200
it. there's no need to pay for it,

483
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,320
right? This is available to the

484
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,240
government and its contractors for free

485
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,640
under a government program. It's an

486
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,760
amazing kind of value ad uh for for the

487
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
government and the people who are

488
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,559
working with the government. And then I

489
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,480
spoke a little bit about our facilities

490
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,760
access and so we have advanced

491
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,840
technology facilities that are available

492
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,400
uh primarily to US companies um on an as

493
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,840
available basis but only to the extent

494
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,840
that that those facilities are not also

495
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,440
uh available through a commercial source

496
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,320
because we don't compete with industry.

497
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,240
And so just to um get through this and

498
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,400
get to the questions, these are some of

499
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,640
the ways we can work with industry and

500
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,200
these are some of ways we cannot. The

501
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,919
most important of which is if a company

502
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
is getting a federal uh pro is under a

503
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,440
federal program and they're getting

504
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,320
federal monies, we cannot be a

505
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,080
subcontractor to a federal program.

506
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,720
Okay. Um and so I would urge you to

507
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,840
learn more. We have laboratory

508
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,760
workshops. Each of our nine divisions

509
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,080
annually has a conference to tell

510
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,280
everyone what we are doing and how we

511
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,159
are doing it. Um we have industry days

512
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,159
where we bring industry to Lincoln so

513
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,880
that we can select an appropriate

514
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,039
transition partner. Um we're happy to do

515
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,799
tech technical exchange meetings and we

516
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,559
do this all the time with companies to

517
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,880
say hey what's going on in this

518
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,880
particular space. We have a catalog of

519
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,840
our capabilities published on our

520
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,760
website. Um we invite large companies or

521
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,320
companies who are interested to come to

522
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,640
Lincoln and give talks to tell us about

523
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,200
their capabilities and their interests

524
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,279
and obviously we we do publish and uh

525
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,880
attend conferences. So I'm just going to

526
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:48,320
go to the questions that disappeared.

527
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,840
Oh here they are. Um

528
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,640
so what are what is the best way for

529
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,400
companies to engage with Lincoln? Um

530
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,520
again it would be to understand that

531
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,840
there's a synergy of R&D interests and

532
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,240
then to reach out either to the person

533
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,520
that seems to be the technical contact

534
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,760
or reach out to me and um you know I

535
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,200
could potentially put you in touch with

536
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,200
uh the appropriate technical contact.

537
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,480
Has there been any impact, positive or

538
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,799
negative,

539
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,120
of government spending at Lincoln? And

540
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,279
have there been staffing cutbacks as a

541
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,799
result of federal funding cutbacks in

542
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,960
the last couple of years? Um, the

543
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,480
government and the administration as

544
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,000
they change from administration to

545
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,919
administration will have different

546
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,520
folky. And so Lincoln is uh it's

547
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,520
important to Lincoln to support the

548
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,159
administration that's currently in

549
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,720
office and their priorities will change.

550
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,279
And so our programs to support the new

551
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,840
administration uh our program directives

552
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:54,559
may change depending on what the uh

553
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,440
overlap is. Um what is the target time

554
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,120
frame for a project and how is each

555
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,400
project evaluated for the decision

556
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,559
makers to continue funding or

557
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,200
allocation? It's a really good question.

558
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,120
So Lincoln does shortterm, you know,

559
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,080
prototyping to meet an immediate need

560
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,720
like I I showed you for for um the

561
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,640
ground clearance uh robot and that was

562
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,840
nine months. Um and we do long-term R&D.

563
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,559
So the 193 nanometer lithography project

564
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,400
took 20 years, right? And so we do

565
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,720
everything in between from less than a

566
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,960
year uh to 20 years because you're

567
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,840
developing essentially brand new

568
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,679
technology spaces. So the target time

569
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,840
frame for a project is going to depend

570
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,520
on who the stakeholder is and what

571
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,080
they're looking for. And it's a really

572
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,559
important conversation for us to have as

573
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,559
we engage with industry to understand

574
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,480
what their timelines look like and how

575
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,480
we can support their timelines and their

576
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,480
objectives.

577
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Uh does Lincoln Lab work with J5? um

578
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,200
uh you know uh we are primarily an FFRDC

579
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,640
and so our primary work is with um the

580
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,480
US government. So

581
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:15,200
um so I think that was it.

582
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:20,279
Oh, one more question. Um

583
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,279
oh great that's it. Thank you so much.
