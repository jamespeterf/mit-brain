1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
welome welcome thanks for the interest

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,120
we look forward to uh getting to know

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,200
you and uh having you here and working

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,240
with you in the future my name is Alex

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,440
I'm an associate professor in the

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,119
operations research group as well with

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,039
Hara and and many others and uh I teach

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,560
I've been teaching in this program for

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,039
six years now uh which doesn't make me

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,039
sound too young um I was teaching

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
analytics Edge for three years at first

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,640
and now I'm teaching uh the optimization

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,360
course

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,040
uh so roughly speaking I'm going going

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,680
to talk a little bit at a higher level

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,079
about what we try to do in the program

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,920
and what what what I teach um uh

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,559
contributes to the program what I do in

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,480
research contributes to the program and

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
that really has to do with this overall

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,360
diagram that youve probably seen um

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,760
several times which is the the overall

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,039
pipeline of analytics from data to

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,760
models to decisions to impact and value

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,920
and uh and really we we're thinking

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,680
about three steps of analytics here

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,839
right the all of the descriptive

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,520
analytics the data management the data

29
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,600
visualization the dashboards that try to

30
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,320
get us like a sense of what our our data

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
what do we what do we have visibility

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,520
into um what do the data tell us what

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,680
seems to be the case what's going on

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,799
what's Happening um which was really the

35
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,759
focus of analytics in the 2000s early

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,119
2010s um which is still the case of like

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,000
many data made many data science

38
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,280
organizations because you know data

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,720
quality is an important thing um and

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,439
then we'll move we're moving from

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,399
descriptive to productive analytics

42
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,399
where we're trying to get insight into

43
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,799
what's going on and why is something

44
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,000
happening and what's going to happen in

45
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,439
the future and so that's really the

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,680
world of machine learning that uh that

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,159
we're all accustomed to by now um and

48
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,680
that is Al maybe the data science of the

49
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,240
2010s and early 2020s uh where more and

50
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,920
more organizations are building a very

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,479
deep analytics team with machine

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,200
learning engineers machine learning

53
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:07,719
scientists with data scientists data

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,039
science engineers and so on so forth um

55
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,480
what what what we pride ourselves um at

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,080
Sloan is to close the loop and go all

57
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,599
the way to the prescriptive analytics

58
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,160
which is kind of what should we do about

59
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,200
it right and it's not only a question of

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,040
what does our data tell us about today's

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,840
system and tomorrow's system it's also

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,360
how can we impact the system to steer it

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,200
into a better Direction um to steer it

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
into a world of higher value higher fact

65
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,000
World cost better efficiency better

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,560
customer service and whatever your

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,480
objective is um and this is really where

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,159
optimization starts playing a role and

69
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,159
that's why we have designed the

70
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,920
curriculum around machine learning and

71
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,640
optimization as the two main

72
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,720
pillars so I have been teaching

73
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,480
optimization for three years um this is

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,159
an example of that pipeline in action um

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,200
so I was talking about descriptive

76
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,040
predictive prescriptive analytics just

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,720
one company one example of um like that

78
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,400
entire pipeline over time for that

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,360
particular example which is UPF um and

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,640
at UPS um they started oops sorry they

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,120
started um putting together a

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,040
um an interesting communication device

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,680
that was called diad that was just

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,799
trying to coordinate the action of all

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,200
of the drivers in their Fleet using

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,120
mobile uh mobile devices so uh like

87
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,280
really old school operations I why this

88
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,319
is doing this I

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,879
apologize um really old school

90
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,400
operations where a centralized

91
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
dispatcher would start calling people

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
saying hey next you go there next you go

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,400
there next you go there and then when

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
they started doing that they realized

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,080
wow there is a lot of value associated

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,640
with centralized control Fleet

97
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,239
optimization Fleet Management and

98
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,200
routing optimization the problem is that

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,120
this is really really hard to do for

100
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,319
many reasons one is that we don't really

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,760
know where people are two we don't

102
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,760
really know what are all of the

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,720
components of demand and travel times

104
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,560
and three even if we know it's really

105
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,879
really hard to optimize this is an

106
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,239
example of a very difficult optimization

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,519
problem vehicle routing optimization

108
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,599
where even if you have perfect

109
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,560
information you have so many possible

110
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,600
decisions to make that it's completely

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,160
unfathomable to the human brain and even

112
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,160
easy algorithms cannot handle that easy

113
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,280
or existing algorithms cannot really

114
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,240
handle that at scale um to deliver the

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,720
value that is needed um because you're

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,160
evolving into complex temporal and

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,800
spatial Network what you do at noon

118
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,280
impacts what you can and cannot do at 6

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,680
PM what you do in uh in the in in the

120
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,720
Bronx impact one you can canot do in

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,080
Manhattan and so all of these things are

122
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,919
interconnected and so you need to

123
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,560
optimize so many decisions all at once

124
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,639
and that's really where the algorithms

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,960
and optimization can help make better

126
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,160
decisions and so here is what happened

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,800
at um at UPS in the 2000s they started

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
putting telematics which is events of

129
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,120
sensors in their trucks to have

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,840
real-time visibility into where people

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,479
are and what they are doing then package

132
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,039
flow technology which is a prescriptive

133
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,639
analytics um um software of you know

134
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,000
machine learning to predict travel times

135
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,080
and predict customer demand and then

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,919
they built on top of that this um tool

137
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,039
called Orion which is onroad integrated

138
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,199
optimization Network or something like

139
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,120
this um that is doing the routing

140
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,960
optimization and the centralized

141
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,880
um an exceptional research development

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,560
and um deployment project to 10 years uh

143
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,440
and resulting in very significant

144
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,560
savings both in terms of monetary

145
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,919
amounts but also in terms of uh carbon

146
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,199
emissions um and um and so what is also

147
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,160
interesting in this example is that uh

148
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,199
and there is a paper that I use in in

149
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,479
teaching that we can discuss in in the

150
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,440
future but um but basically

151
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,039
we tend to think as as data scientists

152
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,280
as that really the technical part being

153
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,240
really what is what is important where

154
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,680
you have you need to do the research you

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
need to do the development you need to

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
do the it systems what is interesting

157
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,560
over there is that the research was 10%

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,880
of the time 10% of the cost okay so what

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,360
else 20% development what what is that

160
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,840
it's basically integrating our

161
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,720
algorithms with the it systems having

162
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,759
end to end pipelines which is something

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,199
that you're going to do a lot of as well

164
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,880
to just make sure that things work in

165
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,560
production work in an automated system

166
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,639
okay but what about the remaining 70%

167
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,120
deployment change management working

168
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,720
with people making sure that they adopt

169
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,880
the tool how they adopt the tool when

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,160
they adopt the tool when they do not how

171
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,479
they use it as a decision support system

172
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,960
and so they have done amazing work to

173
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,639
kind of ensure that integration um one

174
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,880
of my favorite examples is actually

175
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,879
creating a video game where a driver

176
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,400
could compete with the tool understand

177
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,120
where they were making different

178
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,280
decisions and and then they would all

179
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
analyze the data from the video game

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,639
simulation so they could improve the

181
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,160
tool on the one hand but also convince

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,080
the drivers that the tool was making

183
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,039
better decisions sometimes um all right

184
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,759
so this is uh this is one example of

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,560
what we are aspiring to do in each

186
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,919
organization that we are um involved

187
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,080
with um and at our level to start with

188
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,639
we need to to learn optimization so this

189
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,639
is what the what the course will be

190
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,599
about so this is one of the core courses

191
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,199
in the in the program uh the

192
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,319
optimization class that I'm currently

193
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,840
teaching with with the current cohor uh

194
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,759
so we're trying to do that we're trying

195
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,120
to do that by developing models that

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,800
enable to translate uh practical

197
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,840
problems into mathematical models that

198
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,000
are tractable and amable to analysis so

199
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,919
linear optimization integer optimization

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
nonlinear optimization and

201
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,080
whatnot um we are going into algorithms

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,639
how do these methods work um what

203
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,960
solvers are available how do they work

204
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,879
what is doable versus what is really

205
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,520
really hard and what do we do when the

206
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,000
algorithms are not enough and how can we

207
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,560
create our own algorithms to do better

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,960
and then we're also getting into um

209
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,520
practical um practical implications uh

210
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,560
including uh you know how to build

211
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,879
models that are most relevant to

212
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,400
decision makers how to use them ASC

213
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,520
decision tools and what does

214
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,199
optimization tell us in terms of how we

215
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,199
should manage our systems

216
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,479
better the the the plots at the bottom

217
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,520
uh show us the sheer Improvement in

218
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,000
hardware and software techn Oles today

219
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,399
we are in in a world where a lot of

220
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,320
problems that were un unimaginable not

221
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,440
so long ago now are solved routinely in

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,560
practice um and that is unable that is

223
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,279
really unlocking the capabilities of the

224
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,160
world of optimization in a way that is

225
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,959
um uh that is inspiring exciting because

226
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,000
it creates a lot of

227
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,040
opportunities uh and so I do a lot of

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,720
that in my research um let me jump here

229
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,360
directly so I have um three main areas

230
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,920
of research that active at this point

231
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,519
one is in urban Mobility um um the other

232
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,480
one is in decarbonization and the last

233
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,040
one is in Social good so my um Urban

234
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,519
Mobility I I look at microtransit in

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,519
particular so how to create design and

236
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,160
operate systems that are hybrid between

237
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,040
Transit and right sharing what does that

238
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,200
look like how to design it how to op

239
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,760
operate it how to optimize it right so

240
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,959
how to make Transit more flexible or uh

241
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:33,040
and how to use high capacity Vehicles as

242
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:35,079
compared to um Uber lift es DD and other

243
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,240
things um in the world of

244
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,240
decarbonization two projects that we

245
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,240
have active at the moment are one

246
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,200
project on the operations of electric

247
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,320
trucks um and one project on and one

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,360
project on the uh operations of Cloud

249
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
Supply chains in particular Big Data

250
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,399
Center so this is a collaboration with

251
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,800
Microsoft um and then uh in um social

252
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,480
good we had we did one project vaccine

253
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,000
allocation I can talk more about this as

254
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,279
well we have one project on Wildfire

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
suppression and one project on organ

256
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,040
transplantation and all of them are

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
basically some uh resource large scale

258
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,079
resource allocation over time and over

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,920
space in order to move people from place

260
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,160
to place deliver Goods to people um

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,160
deliver data to people in data centers

262
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,240
but also perform Mission critical

263
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,320
activities like providing organs

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,360
providing vaccines or suppressing

265
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,519
wildfires

266
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,160
so this is an example of a project that

267
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,160
we did in the midst of the pandemic

268
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,320
actually in January 2021 so very very

269
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,519
hectic project at first where we were

270
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,519
optimizing for the incoming ban

271
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,639
Administration uh where to locate the

272
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,680
vaccin vaccination centers and then how

273
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,880
to distribute vaccines for like what it

274
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,720
was called at the time the 100 million

275
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,720
vaccines in a 100 day campaign for the

276
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,120
first three month of the administration

277
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,000
and then trying to Pro to get a sense of

278
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,360
who would get vaccinated as a result and

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,560
what the death fall of the pandemic

280
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,760
could be the objective being then to

281
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,440
minimize the death to of the pandemic uh

282
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,240
by optimizing the location of the

283
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,200
vaccination centers and what the what

284
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,839
the the chart on the right is telling us

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,120
is that the propos strategy was

286
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,360
improving the efficacy of a vaccination

287
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,160
campaign by 20 to 30% as compared to

288
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,800
just having something simple that is

289
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,120
let's put vaccination centers where

290
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
there are a lot of people or where there

291
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,839
are a lot of cases we can actually do

292
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,120
better than that and so optimization

293
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,880
matters in that case optimization can

294
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,760
turn one vaccine into 1.2 or 1.3

295
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,639
vaccines if you if you manage your stock

296
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,560
pile effectively so that was that's one

297
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,320
example of what we've been doing where I

298
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,880
can talk way more about it uh of course

299
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,880
I look forward to uh see you soon on

300
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,880
campus
