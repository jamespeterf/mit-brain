1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,040
good afternoon everyone so it's already

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,719
already 405 um and we successfully kick

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,960
off kick out the previous class um so I

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,960
think we should get started because we

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,199
have amazing talk ahead of us uh I will

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,880
keep my introduction short um Professor

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,359
Philip holer it's a program leader at

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,960
MRC laboratory of molecular biology in C

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,360
UK Phil graduated with distinction from

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,200
space uh Swiss Federal Institute of

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,520
Technology uh in other name cth at

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,239
Switzerland and then he came to UK did

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,199
his PhD with Noel lawat Prof uh do sorry

14
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,239
sir gray winter uh during which he

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,719
started uh really amazing work with

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,920
nuclear acids and synthetic biology and

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,640
uh he did a very short pass out there

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,560
then start his tenue check at MRC lmb um

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,240
and got his tenue in 2005 so uh his lab

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,360
aims to better understand the

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,280
foundational principles and chemical

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,400
logic that shape our genetic system

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,799
mostly DNA and RNA um I don't know like

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,280
maybe once a once in a while you may

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,240
wonder why we have DN RNA as our genetic

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,759
M materials why it has to be reel so why

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:32,000
it has to be four bases if not more or

28
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:35,240
less so uh to us that questions um

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,880
Philip slab is really doing amazing work

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:43,320
to try to recapitulate what happened

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,759
initially how the first life on Earth uh

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,680
emerged and why um this whole

33
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,840
replication system is possible with

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,320
simpler chemical structures to begin

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,560
with uh without further Ado I just want

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,840
to welcome our speaker today again uh to

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,840
deliver the talk thanks so much

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,119
thank you can you hear me thank you sh

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,599
for the introduction and for the yeah

40
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,560
for inviting me here and giving me the

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,720
opportunity to tell you a little bit

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,599
about our work um so this being the town

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,080
of Jack shostak and David Bartell I'm

44
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,040
just going to talk about polymerize

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,200
riboses and actually not talking much

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,360
about the xnas so really what we start

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,120
with is this um central dogma kind of

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,959
diagram introduced in the 19 70s to sort

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,360
of summarize the idea that information

50
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:41,640
flow in biological system is mostly

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:44,680
unidirectional from um okay from uh from

52
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,360
DNA into RNA into proteins but then

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,840
immediately people recognize there's a

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,159
sort of strange dichotomy uh to this

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,920
system in that you know we need nucleic

56
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,720
acids to make proteins but then we need

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,519
proteins to make nucleic acids so how do

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,400
you get a system like that started up

59
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,920
you know how do you boot up life

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,360
and and this is over 50 years ago Les

61
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,480
Francis Crick Leslie Orel and coose and

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,560
also Alex Rich here at MIT sort of

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,360
proposed an idea which was pretty

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,080
far-fetched at the time uh which was

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,640
that there was a primordial biology

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,799
which was much more primitive and where

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,440
RNA was doing most of the sort of heavy

68
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,400
lifting both catalysis and and

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,080
information and although that's you know

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
still kind of you know there is no sort

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,720
of concrete evidence for such as it

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,959
became known an RNA World um ever

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,680
existing there's a lot of compelling

74
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,400
circumstantial evidence maybe the

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,159
Smoking Gun is really the structure of

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,159
the ribosome sort of central Hub of

77
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,879
protein synthesis in all cells which is

78
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,480
mostly RNA including the peptidal

79
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,439
transfer center and really a

80
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,760
Cornerstone of this idea of an RNA world

81
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,000
is is this that it must have started

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,640
with maybe an RNA that gained the

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,319
capacity to co make copies of itself to

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,640
self-replicate

85
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,680
and uh so many people such RNA does not

86
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,760
exist in in nature so many groups have

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,640
been searching uh you know to build such

88
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,560
an RNA uh replicas in the lab to maybe

89
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,079
study the um the properties of life's

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,919
first genetic system by proxy by

91
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,639
studying a molecular doppelganger and we

92
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,240
sort of joined this effort um um you

93
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,800
know you you know starting from this

94
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,560
truly amazing kind of polymerase uh

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,320
ribozyme that was discovered this

96
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,080
polymerus ribosy discovered in David

97
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,880
bartel's Lab at the white head and it

98
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,280
still sometimes blows my mind that such

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,880
a uh simple molecule which is this is

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,400
about an RNA it's about bit over 200

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,479
nucleotides long can carry out such a

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,440
sophisticated uh molecular function

103
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:55,080
which is to read out the sequence of an

104
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,680
RNA template and synthesiz its its

105
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,720
complementary sequence you can see it

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,240
doing its job here so just

107
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,639
um sorry just to to just to introduce

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,639
these type of gels you're going to see a

109
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,639
few of them this is a primary extension

110
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,759
gel is a nice semi-quantitative way of

111
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
measuring polymerase activity where you

112
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,000
enlabel a primer you let the polymerase

113
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,199
do its job and then you separate the

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
products on a polyacryamide gel and you

115
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,000
can see each sort of band denotes an

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,720
incorporation step so this uh polymerase

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,639
RNA polymerase ribosy can do about 14

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,440
incorporation steps and then it's SP

119
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,520
um so that's not quite ready for

120
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,280
self-replication but we thought our

121
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,560
first talk should be this ribosy is

122
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,880
about 200 nucleotides long can we

123
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,960
acquire can we engineer this further can

124
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,800
we evolve it to acquire the ability to

125
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,479
synthesize rnas that are at least as

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,240
long or ideally longer than itself but

127
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
you know before I start with this there

128
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,800
is something that always bothered me

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,199
about the RNA world I mean I don't know

130
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,919
how many of you have worked with RNA

131
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,039
it's a pretty fragile molecule if you

132
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,599
expose it to alkaline pH to high

133
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,360
temperatures or to divalent metal ions

134
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,599
in par in particularly um uh transition

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,199
metals or God forbid combinations of

136
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:18,199
that kind of it quickly degrades now

137
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,160
that's all very well in the lab where

138
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,240
you can control conditions in nice clean

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,039
Endor tubes but on the surface of the

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,000
early Earth with sort of meteorites

141
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:30,599
raining down hot Boiling Springs come on

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,520
RNA is a pretty perverse choice

143
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:37,280
um as a primordial genetic material now

144
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,319
other people have proposed a pre RNA

145
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,479
world uh that would then be based uh on

146
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,759
a much more resilient genetic polymer

147
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,840
which then transitions to RNA but it's

148
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,360
worth saying that there's zero evidence

149
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,560
for that so we wondered if we could

150
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,120
think of environments where RNA would

151
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,440
make more sense and on the face of it

152
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,960
the answer to that is pretty obvious

153
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,240
because what do you do both in the lab

154
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,440
and at home if you you're dealing with

155
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,560
sort of perishable things that's right

156
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,319
you put them in the freezer but we also

157
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,199
need the uh RNA to be an enzyme and

158
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,319
certainly protein enzymes don't take

159
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,720
kindly to being frozen so this is RNA t7

160
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,440
RNA polymerase you can see it happily

161
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,199
synthesizes RNA at 37° but when you

162
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,400
freeze it it's dead but the polymerized

163
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:30,039
ribosy is very different you can see not

164
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,759
only is it active um um not only is it

165
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,160
active in the ice but if you just wait a

166
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,000
little bit long enough it pretty much

167
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,520
shows the same activity as at ambient

168
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,440
temperature so it retains it activity

169
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,560
when Frozen and in fact if you kind of

170
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,680
adjust the conditions just a little bit

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,919
you know it can synthesize rnas that are

172
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,879
actually quite a bit longer than it can

173
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,520
do at ambient temperature so it is a

174
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,240
little bit like the toris and the hair

175
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,479
it's a bit slower in the ice but it just

176
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,840
keeps going and going and making more

177
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:02,120
and more

178
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,960
RNA um and reason for that is and this

179
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:09,039
wasn't discovered by us is that it would

180
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,080
be wrong to to think of um uh ice as a

181
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,919
sort of homogeneous solid medium because

182
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,759
what really happens is when you freeze

183
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,199
an aquous solution that doesn't just

184
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,919
contain water but contains RNA and maybe

185
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,120
magnesium and some nucleotide

186
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,720
triphosphates the water freezes out

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,120
first and excludes the solutes into a

188
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,479
liquid uh uh brine phase the so-called

189
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,680
tic phase which surrounds the ice cre

190
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,839
crystals and actually stays liquid at

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
subzero temperatures and this is

192
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,279
accompanied by a tremendous

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,399
concentration and dehydration um effect

194
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,279
which sort of compensates for the low

195
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,279
temperature and accelerates the the

196
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,760
synthesis reactions so this really looks

197
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,399
like a you know a nice environment for

198
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,000
RNA to do its job and in fact all the

199
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,720
reactions you see from here on are done

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,640
in ice um in in our lab so as a next

201
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,279
step we try to do evolution in ice and

202
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,880
we selected a new variant of the

203
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,880
polymerase

204
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,440
ribosy and um to to adapt it to the Ice

205
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,399
phas uh a bit better and this one I hope

206
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:19,160
you can see this here this is a about

207
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,480
206 nucleotide synthesis band so it can

208
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,440
now synthesize rnas that are longer than

209
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,079
itself because it's about 23 this is 206

210
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,120
so we've been we've there we're there it

211
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:33,480
can synthesize RNA as long than itself

212
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,360
but can it synthesize itself no it can't

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,440
so that was really frustrating so why

214
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,839
can it synthesize this rnas that are

215
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,959
longer but it can't make itself and um

216
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,200
to to figure out what's going on we fed

217
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,079
this ribosy simple simple pool of random

218
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,959
RNA sequences and asked asked it to to

219
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,839
copy them and just see which ones can

220
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,560
you copy which ones you

221
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,200
can't and when you analyze these I'm

222
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,040
sorry these sequences the ones it can be

223
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,920
copied they behave like strings they're

224
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,240
unfolded but the ones that it can't copy

225
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,560
the moment you have a little bit of

226
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,760
secondary structure in the RNA this RNA

227
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,800
polymerized ribosy uh can can cannot

228
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,200
read through those uh

229
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,200
structures and and really this um this

230
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,360
brings us to this dichotomy of RNA that

231
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,320
it has to be as what Larry gold called

232
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,440
it has to be both a string and a thing

233
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,959
and it needs to be both be able to fold

234
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,440
up and then on fold again to become a

235
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,200
template and and and really you you'll

236
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,839
encounter this sort of theme throughout

237
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,639
the talk but the fact that it cannot

238
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,040
that this polymerized ribosy cannot copy

239
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,680
structured rnas now leads us to what is

240
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,560
uh an apparent Paradox because the RNA

241
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,720
needs to fold into a three-dimensional

242
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,560
structure to be a polymerase ribosy but

243
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,720
then once folded rnas cannot be

244
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,880
replicated by the polymerase ribosy so

245
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,480
how do you get around this and um one

246
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,800
solution I'm going to tell you a lot

247
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,240
about that we came up with involves that

248
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,519
we rethink the the substrates that the

249
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,560
polymerase uses so so far the polymerase

250
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,200
riboses that I shown you they all use

251
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,440
the mononucleotide triphosphates that

252
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,600
are also used by natural RNA polymerizes

253
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,399
but really it was always a bit

254
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,880
optimistic to think that at the origin

255
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,639
of Life you'd have a nice clean pool of

256
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,200
you know ntps kind of like ready for you

257
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,399
so there would be a mixture of things

258
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,079
maybe dinucleotides trinucleotides

259
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,279
tetranucleotides Etc and the question is

260
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,000
which one of these would be good

261
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:40,320
substrates so we did a a number of trial

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,480
experiments and eventually settled on

263
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,200
trinucleotides uh or specifically

264
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,320
trinucleotide triphosphates as as

265
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,320
substrates with with with good

266
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,680
properties that is they would were

267
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,880
Incorporated well by the polymerase

268
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,760
ribosy but they also maintain the

269
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,240
Fidelity of interaction which you lose

270
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,720
when you actually go to longer r

271
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,800
oligomers and just to make life a little

272
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
bit easier instead of saying TR

273
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,560
nucleotide triphosphate each time and

274
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,959
from now I'm going to call these

275
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,480
triplets so um this shows the problem

276
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,839
again so this is a sort of series of RNA

277
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,600
templates this is the primer and you

278
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,079
know they have an increasing tendency to

279
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,920
fold back on itself now with the old uh

280
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:27,519
the mononucleotide polymerize you can

281
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,360
see it can copy the first one but then

282
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,440
it's pretty much stumped kind of like

283
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,760
with each of the others but if we now

284
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,760
switch to trinucleotide triphosphates

285
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,959
again to Triplet substrates you can see

286
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,320
we can copy through all of them and

287
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,040
what's even

288
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,839
better when you sort of um plot the

289
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,519
curve of uh the amount of RNA you

290
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,440
synthesize as a function of tripet

291
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,360
concentration on the unstructured

292
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,800
template you get a sort of saturation

293
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,720
curve which is what you expect of an

294
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,000
enzyme as you increase uh the substrate

295
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,920
concentration but if we do this on the

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,920
structure templates we get a sigmoidal

297
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,760
curve you just get a sort of transition

298
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,160
at about 10 micromolar triplet

299
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,040
concentration uh where suddenly kind of

300
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,160
like synthesis increases kind of to a

301
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,519
much greater extent and our

302
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,160
interpretation of this is that actually

303
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,880
you know that the triplets it's the

304
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,160
triplets that invade the secondary

305
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,240
structure so there's a sort of

306
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,160
ratchetlike progress of synthesis where

307
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,360
the triplets at a certain

308
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,639
concentration uh are become able to

309
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,560
invade the secondary structure leading

310
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,279
to a Cooperative unfolding of the

311
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,639
template which then can be

312
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,680
copied so at this point we became really

313
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,880
interested in you know evolving this as

314
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,800
a triplet polymerase ribosy and this is

315
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,720
our result which we came up with we

316
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,480
didn't ask for it the enzyme became a

317
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,160
heterodimer a mutualistic heterodimer of

318
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,320
an active and an inactive subunit we've

319
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,839
recently managed to solve the um crym

320
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,680
structure of the APO enzyme and you can

321
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,199
see here there's the catalytic subunit

322
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,240
in red and in blue you see the non

323
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,440
catalytic subunit which actually derives

324
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,320
from the catalytic subunit but in just

325
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,160
kind of you know a few mutations kind of

326
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,040
completely rearranges the structure and

327
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,480
sort of provides a scaffold to hold the

328
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,360
catalytic subunit in place as you can

329
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,720
see this this polymerase ribosy the what

330
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,480
we from now I'm going to call the

331
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,600
triplet polymerase ribosy has

332
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,720
substantial triplet and sort of oligomer

333
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,440
uh polymerize

334
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,320
activity um and it can really synthesize

335
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,759
some pretty tricky substrates so this is

336
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,920
the broccoli RN aper which binds this

337
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,000
chromophor become fluorescent it's a

338
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,920
sort of pretty much stay all together a

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,759
hairpin structure all the way but now

340
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,320
you know the triple polymerase ribosy

341
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,000
can synthesize them and the broccoli is

342
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,639
active because if you add the chromophor

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,199
to the gel you can see this is made with

344
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,160
uh t7 RNA polymerize this is made with a

345
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,199
ribosy you get a sort of an extra

346
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,839
triplet added to the end but they are

347
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,920
nicely fluorescent and active and what's

348
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,279
better you can do both strand so you can

349
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,240
actually replicate kind of both strands

350
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,839
of this uh broccoli aptamer and just to

351
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,199
show you again what sort of structures

352
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,639
look like this is a structure of the

353
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:13,199
related chili uh fluorescent timer and

354
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,320
you can see this is really a hairpin

355
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,600
structure all the way with a sort of

356
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,560
interrupted G quadruplex in the middle

357
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,959
which binds the chromophor I don't think

358
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,040
you could come up with a much harder uh

359
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:28,079
uh substrate uh to to to

360
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,160
replicate what's amazing is that the

361
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,600
triplets now also unlock kind of um uh

362
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
replication modes which are not

363
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,959
available in nature because all RNA

364
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,120
replication in nature proceeds in the

365
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:42,120
five Prime to three prime Direction but

366
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,079
because the triplets bind to the

367
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,240
template there's no reason why they

368
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,720
can't go in the reverse provided you

369
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,240
give it a primer which is phosphorilated

370
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,360
at the three prime end and indeed that

371
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,079
works so this is the forward uh reaction

372
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,000
you give it a normal primer you give it

373
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:02,680
the triplets happily synthes Siz is RNA

374
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,040
now we give it the reverse primer

375
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,720
phosphorilated at the five Prime end and

376
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,279
you can see it does uh the same reaction

377
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,079
and what's better if you give it both

378
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,560
primers it can do both reactions at the

379
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,079
same

380
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,600
time because the triplets bind to the

381
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,600
RNA template they can now act as primers

382
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,279
themselves so you can see in lane two

383
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,040
this is the re primary extension

384
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,880
reaction with a primer and in lane four

385
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,639
where we give it no primer at all just

386
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,440
triplets and you can see you can make

387
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,680
exactly the same product and you can use

388
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,120
that synthesized product and prime it

389
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,040
again just using triplets and again make

390
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,120
both uh strands of the

391
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,519
RNA now initiation from triplets has a

392
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,440
number of consequences and one of them

393
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,160
is that there's now a large

394
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,920
combinatorial number of Pathways by

395
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,920
which the ribosome can make the full

396
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,440
length so this is um this is a a 24mer

397
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,440
RNA

398
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:07,240
template

399
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:09,039
okay this is a 24mer RNA template and

400
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,000
these are all the potential

401
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,559
Pathways now if you had the normal five

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,360
Prime to three prime synthesis you would

403
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,439
expect a sort of a clockwise Arc to

404
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,319
appear if you had the five the three

405
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,959
prime to five Prime Direction you would

406
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,799
expect an anticlockwise arc and using

407
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,400
Next Generation sequencing we can now

408
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,320
take a snapshot of the reaction and find

409
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,000
out what actually is

410
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,760
happening so each of these dots

411
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,120
represents a product of the reaction and

412
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,520
the sort of size of the dots represents

413
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,400
kind of how much there is and you can

414
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,000
see there is a nice clockwise Arc here

415
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,240
kind of starting from here with the

416
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,640
synthesis but as you can see up here

417
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,640
there's other products so what's

418
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,520
happening there is actually the first

419
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,039
kind of uh after the first kind of d uh

420
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,880
triplet liation the enzyme likes to

421
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,919
connect to the second second kind of

422
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,760
dinucleotide and form a second Arc so

423
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,080
there's two arcs kind of going to the

424
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,799
full length product and you can see what

425
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,799
we conclude from this there's two

426
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,480
independent initiations from two

427
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:17,960
triplets um and uh independently

428
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,640
extending now let's look at a different

429
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,480
slightly longer at 27 more template now

430
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
already just looking at the pattern you

431
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,240
can see this is very different so this

432
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,840
uses a very different

433
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,720
pathway you have this time quite a nice

434
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,400
developed anticlockwise Arc but you can

435
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,080
see you have all these other kind of

436
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,919
arcs here as well and you know just took

437
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,120
a long story short if you try to

438
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,320
reconstruct the pathway you come up with

439
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,120
four at least four independent

440
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,760
initiation events both in the forward

441
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,080
and the reverse Direction so what's

442
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,440
really exciting is the system as we ask

443
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,919
it to replicate RNA can now find its own

444
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,120
way it can initiate where it wants fill

445
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,720
in the gaps and sort of find the low the

446
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,799
PA path of lowest resistance to find uh

447
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,960
to make the the final

448
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:11,919
product okay now another really

449
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,080
important aspect of um RNA catalyzed RNA

450
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,039
replication is if we want to go to

451
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,600
self-replication this reaction must

452
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:22,159
preed with a certain Fidelity that which

453
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,919
is defined by the uh famous error

454
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:28,080
threshold of Manfred igen because if you

455
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,520
do not operate above the error threshold

456
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,280
a the the majority of the sequences you

457
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,760
generate will be basically inactive you

458
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,559
will have destroyed the phenotype and

459
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:42,520
there can be no inheritance and no

460
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:45,039
Evolution now one way to um enhance the

461
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,280
Fidelity of RNA

462
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,760
replication and obviously Fidelity is a

463
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,520
problem that is also occurring in

464
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,039
biology and one way to enhance the

465
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,280
Fidelity is to not just rely on the base

466
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,720
pairing but to actually read out the

467
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,960
hydrogen bond donor and accept the power

468
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,080
patterns in the minor Groove and this is

469
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,120
done both by DNA polymerizes and uh in

470
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,960
the decoding center of the

471
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,080
ribosome and in fact my colleague Wy RAR

472
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,880
chrishan sort of speculated on the basis

473
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,400
of the structure of the ribosome

474
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,080
decoding Center that really the

475
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Primitive replicas the RNA replicas that

476
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,720
we're looking for if it was able to read

477
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,919
out minor Groove hydrogen bondona uh

478
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,799
patterns its Fidelity would be much

479
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,480
improved and which would potentially

480
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:35,400
allow much more accurate uh uh

481
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,840
replication and more complex systems to

482
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,000
evolve so we thought we should really

483
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,600
try to select for Fidelity and how do

484
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,880
you do this so we started by feeding now

485
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
the main source of error of these RNA

486
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,840
replication reactions are geow wobble

487
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,440
pairs so we um we presented the the

488
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,360
ribber with two triplets the correct one

489
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,240
and a sort of a terminated triplet with

490
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,120
the wobble pair so the terminated

491
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,480
triplet but cannot be extended so if the

492
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,720
polymerase incorporates it wrongly it

493
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,360
cannot synthesize to the edge of to the

494
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,159
end of the Strand and as you can see

495
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,440
during uh selection initially the Wubble

496
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,919
the wobble triplets actually

497
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,200
Incorporated slightly better but as we

498
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,840
as we keep going eventually it's its

499
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,159
incorporation

500
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,559
disappears and at the end of this

501
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,039
replication experiment if you look at

502
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,840
the Fidelity of the triplet polymerase

503
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,919
so this is for the first the second and

504
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,480
the third position of the triplet you

505
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,520
can see initially the Fidelity overall

506
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,440
wasn't very bad and it was particularly

507
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,919
bad for the for the the third uh base of

508
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,240
the triplet but after Evolution both the

509
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,200
second and the triplet have much

510
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,799
improved although there's still wobble

511
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,400
pairing uh uh in the first base triplet

512
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,159
but the overall Fidelity has now

513
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,080
improved to about

514
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:55,840
97% now to find out if this really is

515
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,679
based on hydrogen bond pairing um going

516
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,000
to show you some some cool experiments

517
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,440
done bya raguram who is who is um I

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,559
think a group leader now here at the

519
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,360
broad and and was in Cambridge briefly

520
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,600
kind of for a summer intership did some

521
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,080
cool experiments by testing essentially

522
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,760
if we could prove kind of that minor uh

523
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,320
that the minor group hydrogen bond donor

524
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,760
acceptors were were um were re read out

525
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,039
by replacing the urine where the car the

526
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,120
the the keto group is like a uh often

527
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,520
used as a hydrogen bond donor except the

528
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,440
replace ing this with two cou which

529
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,120
can't form a hydrogen bond and also

530
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,320
replacing the two prime hydroxy of RNA

531
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,440
with a floro group which again kind of

532
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,240
abolishes hydrogen

533
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,919
bonding and you can then measure the

534
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,799
impact on Fidelity if you have this mod

535
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,320
modification present or not and the

536
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,240
experiments he did sort of clearly

537
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,600
showed that at the third tripet position

538
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,799
um the minor Groove is definitively

539
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,559
engaged because if if you for example

540
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,679
replace urine with two th iDine the

541
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,400
Fidelity uh drops back to the Baseline

542
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,640
uh while at the first position there is

543
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,400
very little

544
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,559
effect now how does this work now

545
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,080
unfortunately the cryoem structure that

546
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,640
we have only um only is of the APO

547
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,799
enzyme so we don't know exactly how the

548
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,200
triplet polymerase ribosy engages uh the

549
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:27,120
primate template duplex and the incoming

550
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,679
triplet but we can build a model based

551
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,720
on the structure of the class on Lio is

552
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,080
ribosy and if you do that if you fit the

553
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,520
primer template into our structure you

554
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
can see you can see in red the active

555
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,400
site and the the the sorry the catalytic

556
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,000
site in green and the a minor kind of

557
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,159
interaction Motif in red and in blue you

558
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,440
can see this P10 Loop which emerges

559
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,919
during the Fidelity selection which is

560
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,279
sort of poised to interact uh with with

561
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,240
the primer template duplex and in more

562
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,840
detail you can see it is sort of

563
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,760
perfectly positioned to to actually

564
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,400
hydrogen bond to the incoming uh Tri

565
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,960
triplet here in red and this is the P10

566
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,320
Loop and this I think what gives us the

567
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,240
High Fidelity in the forward reaction

568
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,320
because in the reverse reaction the P10

569
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,520
Loop is in the wrong place and it's

570
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,720
positioned over the primer and can't

571
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,400
contact the triplet incoming triplet

572
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,000
here in red and this may explain kind of

573
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,919
why the reverse reaction has a much

574
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,840
lower Fidelity uh back to

575
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,720
Baseline Okay so there's another way in

576
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,799
which um in which triplets kind of seem

577
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,120
to influence Fidelity and this is

578
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,840
completely unexpected and is based on

579
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,399
the sort of systems level properties uh

580
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,000
of the triplet pools so the first hint

581
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,960
we got from that is when we looked at

582
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,360
the Fidelity of two triplets so this is

583
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,520
Prett pretty much the worst case

584
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,399
scenario the the ribos sign really

585
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,279
discriminates those very very poorly

586
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:56,520
that in 30% of the cases the wrong the

587
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:59,520
wobble pair triplet is actually

588
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,679
Incorporated but um

589
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,960
before I do this just just to to to

590
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,200
notice if we have a pool of 64 triplet

591
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,399
for each triplets there is also its

592
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,159
perfect anti- triplet in the pool now

593
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:14,360
what we did is if you give if you

594
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,520
provide those those to those two

595
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,080
triplets they're anti-

596
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,039
triplets the Fidelity actually improves

597
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,039
by over three fold now this is totally

598
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,159
unexpected because those triplets have

599
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,760
nothing to bind to in the template the

600
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,840
template just codes for uh ACC

601
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,559
incorporation now if you use the same

602
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,559
template and you give it all 64 triplets

603
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,799
another weird effect pops up because if

604
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,799
you increase the triplet concentration

605
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,799
again normally would expect with

606
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,799
increasing triplet concentration for the

607
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,520
Fidelity to drop but in fact the

608
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,120
Fidelity increases let's look at another

609
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,480
example here the Fidelity phenotype

610
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,320
isn't so bad but again if you provide

611
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,840
the anti-t triplet it gets almost four

612
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,640
times better on the same template you

613
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,080
use the NN pools again the Fidelity

614
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,399
increases so what's going on now if you

615
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,640
look

616
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:08,360
at basically all the triplets and you

617
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,960
look where the Fidelity effect is the

618
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,760
most pronounced you can see only above

619
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,880
50% GC is where you see a significant

620
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,120
shift and you can um we can look at this

621
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,600
here where you look at the Fidelity

622
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,279
effect at High versus low concentration

623
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,320
of nnn triplets and all the a triplets

624
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,840
behave as you would expect at higher

625
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,320
concentration the Fidelity drops but for

626
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,600
all the GC Rich triplets the Fidelity

627
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,760
increases at higher concentration so

628
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,120
what's going on now we think kind of

629
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,880
because this KD range is exactly in the

630
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,799
sort of range that has previously been

631
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,399
shown to promote dimer formation among

632
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:52,159
trnas between codon and

633
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:55,360
anticodons I think our hypothesis is

634
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,279
that these triplet anti- triplet

635
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,360
interactions in the pool of a Tri of

636
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,240
triplets they occur uh between

637
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,520
selectively between the GC triplets and

638
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,600
so what really happens is the pool sort

639
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,799
of normalizes these interaction networks

640
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,200
increase the Fidelity by normalizing the

641
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,200
triplet substrate pool against base

642
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,960
pairing strength all the strongly

643
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,799
pairing GC triplets form diers and

644
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,480
they're the concentration of those free

645
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,960
triplets drops uh as a function of their

646
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,880
base pairing strengths while the more

647
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,520
weakly interacting a triplets don't form

648
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,200
diers and stay their concentration is

649
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,399
increased so overall this is the same

650
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,039
effect as you if you would deplete the

651
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,480
most mispairing triplets selectively

652
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,480
from the

653
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,679
pool okay so here's another uh RNA

654
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:50,960
replication problem whenever you make R

655
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,720
whenever you replicate RNA the product

656
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,679
is invariably an RNA duplex and RNA

657
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,760
duplexes are insanely stable and these

658
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,600
double stranded dup r are basically in

659
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,519
they cannot be replicated by the RNA

660
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,960
polymerase ribosy they just are not

661
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,080
substrates and I just show you this here

662
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,360
two two strands this is the plus strand

663
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,720
this is the minus strand you can copy

664
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,880
them happily but you give it the duplex

665
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,600
you you preform a duplex of the plus and

666
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,200
the minus strand there is no RNA

667
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,000
synthesis whatsoever and this is uh

668
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,519
known as The Strand separation

669
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,360
problem so clearly we need to unzip the

670
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,000
Strand so let's see how we can do this

671
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,880
now as I told you before RNA doesn't

672
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
like to be heated up and particularly

673
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,519
not in the presence of

674
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,640
magnesium um um which we need for

675
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:44,399
ribosome activity so

676
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:46,200
how how can we um dissociate those super

677
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,679
stable

678
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,360
duplexes now one idea is uh came up uh

679
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,600
my colleague John Sutherland came up

680
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,159
with this idea to to actually use acid

681
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,640
RNA is is surprisingly stable at acidic

682
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,600
pH

683
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,799
uh and uh the base pairs uh begin to

684
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,720
protonate around ph4 and obviously this

685
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,799
destabilizes the the

686
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,320
interaction unfortunately to really kind

687
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,840
of U

688
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,120
separate um the sort of duplexes we like

689
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,240
to replicate especially in the presence

690
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,519
of magnesium which further stabilizes

691
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,559
them you have to go back down to to

692
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:28,320
maybe um

693
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:30,519
pH uh pH like you know 2.5 uh to to

694
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,960
really get good dissociation and you

695
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,200
also have to to elevate the temperature

696
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,679
so uh RNA duplexes can be dissociated

697
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,039
but it's hard and you need to use

698
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,159
conditions um that are not compatible

699
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,519
with ribosy activity so you then need to

700
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,080
neutralize again to do synthesis but

701
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,840
what if you do that you see the duplex

702
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,840
can't be synthesized now we melt the

703
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,159
duplex with acid and neutralize and add

704
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,679
the

705
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,360
ribosy now you can do it now you can

706
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,120
synthesize both strands with somewhat

707
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,880
reduced that uh yield but it can be done

708
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,080
so double stranded RNA can be

709
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,360
dissociated by acid pH and high

710
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,159
temperatures and the dissociated strands

711
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,519
can be replicated so now we have a way

712
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,600
to actually do some sort of ribosy PCR

713
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,880
now we can go through multiple cycles of

714
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,760
replication um and I should say that if

715
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,600
you don't uh uh replicate it the strands

716
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,200
rapidly zip up together again and we can

717
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,519
measure that the half life is about

718
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,200
three minutes in about three minutes all

719
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,240
the RNA has for reformed the duplex and

720
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
um and that is

721
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,440
unfortunately too fast for the ribosy to

722
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,519
to to to copy it because the ribosy is

723
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,720
really not a fast

724
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,760
enzyme but again triplets come to the

725
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,600
rescue because if you dissociate the

726
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,600
strands and then add the triplets before

727
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,760
you

728
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,440
neutralize um the um the strands can no

729
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,240
longer anal so the triplets actually

730
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,080
attenuate they connect ically and

731
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,039
thermodynamically stabilize the

732
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,760
dissociated state so to enable

733
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,720
replication and this just shows you sort

734
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,559
of a sketchy Delta G diagram where you

735
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,200
dissociate um the single stranded state

736
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,960
is a sort of high energy state which

737
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,600
wants to go back to a low energy State

738
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,080
um which is the duplex but because the

739
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,440
triplets bind to the dissociated strands

740
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,480
this this a becomes a um a a the

741
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,880
stabilizes a thermodynamic and because

742
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,399
you now have to strip all the triplets

743
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,120
off before you can zip back together it

744
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:38,039
also slows it down kinetically so this

745
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,960
really stabilizes the single stranded

746
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:44,559
State and slows down stranded

747
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,960
kneeling and uh this does not work with

748
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,799
the mononucleotide triphosphates so when

749
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,600
we do this with the old RNA polymerase

750
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,080
ribosy and the mononucleotide

751
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,039
triphosphates you can't copy the duplex

752
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,799
even if you have dissociated it with

753
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,639
acid okay so now we've got a scheme that

754
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,360
we need to do we need to dis dissociate

755
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:06,960
the strands with acid neutralize at the

756
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,840
triplets and the rivy and replicate and

757
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,039
go through these Cycles but there is a

758
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,159
problem for dissociation we need low PH

759
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:17,080
high temperatures and low concentrations

760
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,559
of everything in particularly RNA for

761
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,000
synthesis we need you know actually

762
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,159
mildly basic pH we need low temperatures

763
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,679
and obviously we need high

764
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,880
concentrations ideally of everything so

765
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,080
these are sort of really opposing

766
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,120
conditions but uh again something I told

767
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,880
you before earlier comes to the rescue

768
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,000
because we can now kind of have this

769
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,039
tremendous concent take advantage of the

770
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,440
tremendous concentration effect of ice

771
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:45,880
and also to bring the temperature down

772
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,600
so if we now

773
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:52,279
combine uh hot temperatures and low PH

774
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,760
with freezing sorry with freezing and

775
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:59,559
high pH we should be able to uh by free

776
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,799
by coupling free cycles and pH Cycles we

777
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,799
should be able to decouple the Strand

778
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:06,760
separation and the synthesis steps this

779
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,960
is just a little cartoon which shows you

780
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,720
how this should be working you know you

781
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,600
start with a duplex you move it to ph3

782
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,480
heat it up they come apart you add the

783
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,480
triplets you move it to ph9 and you

784
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,360
freeze and add the ribosy and now it

785
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,559
copies it we move back to ph3 they come

786
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,440
apart and so on and so on and you should

787
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,360
be able to get exponential RNA

788
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,120
replication and I would say this C T is

789
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,679
a little bit optimistic because it shows

790
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,120
a doubling in fact um it's not so good

791
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,679
you only probably double in the best

792
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,840
case scenario every five Cycles but you

793
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:46,039
can now use this kind of if you want

794
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,840
acid free cycle PCR kind of to to to to

795
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:50,919
to really kind of replicate and amplify

796
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,840
double stranded

797
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,799
rnas now what's more interesting than

798
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,080
this is what happens when you feed the

799
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,320
system not a defined sequence with

800
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,399
primers but actually a random sequence

801
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,840
library and a random sequence template

802
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:08,440
um uh with um with with with primers

803
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,200
with defined primers

804
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,839
attached um now I think this is really

805
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,480
weak but this is the original length

806
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,679
template and you can see in the first

807
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,240
five Cycles this is sort of synthesized

808
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,839
you can see a little bit of the full

809
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,800
length template but as we keep going

810
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,960
through more and more Cycles um the

811
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,679
system sort of shifts to a different

812
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,040
sequence pop population and you can see

813
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,520
these strong product bands emerging

814
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,440
which are truncated from the full length

815
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,599
and these actually grow exponentially

816
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,839
over many

817
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,440
cycles and these sequences when you

818
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,520
analyze it it's quite a diverse pool but

819
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,639
these sequences have now been selected

820
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:50,560
by the ribosy for being nice to copy for

821
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,720
what I would call replicability so the

822
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,520
system itself actually syn uh uh selects

823
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,040
for highly replicable RNA sequences they

824
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,200
emerge spontaneously from a random pool

825
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,079
and then act amplify exponentially upon

826
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:08,160
continued RNA replication and you can

827
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,960
pick out some sequences uh from this of

828
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,200
the different lengths and you can see

829
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,920
they nicely grow over uh five Cycles um

830
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,040
and and and keep

831
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,079
amplifying now I've told you before

832
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,160
about primer free replication now what

833
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,640
happens if you do this without any

834
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,079
primers so in this experiment all we

835
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:32,599
feed into the system is an 20 seat

836
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:36,880
sequence uh all 64 triplets the ribosy

837
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:39,240
and we just let it go as you can see uh

838
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,680
initially it begins it copies the N20

839
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,240
seat but then very rapidly a sort of

840
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,079
ladder kind of of products appears which

841
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,680
grows in intensity as we keep going um

842
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,839
now what is really interesting is we

843
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,960
also do a control where we don't add the

844
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,079
N20 SE sequence seat sequence which

845
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,280
initially you know shows a sort of very

846
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,280
weak p pattern but then the sort of

847
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,119
banding pattern appears and then the

848
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,839
minus the the sequence which the the

849
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,240
reactions which had no template input at

850
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,359
all they actually begin to overtake the

851
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,760
ones which had an RNA template so what

852
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:17,800
goes on so we analyze these Pools by

853
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Next Generation

854
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,079
sequencing and what you find is that

855
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,240
actually a large number of these

856
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,920
sequences are actually homologous to the

857
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,640
ribosy so this is now in the pool which

858
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,280
had not had template sequence added so

859
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,640
essentially in the absence of a template

860
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,680
uh what the ribosy does it uses itself

861
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,400
as a template so it first kind of

862
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,880
synthesizes uh you know pieces of the

863
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,520
minor Strand and then uh uh these

864
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,000
eventually become used later on as

865
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,880
templates to be to synthesize the plus

866
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,280
strand so these are all sort of small

867
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,119
fragments I would say these are not

868
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,040
contiguous sequences but this is all

869
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,079
sort of small pieces of the ribosy that

870
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,720
are being

871
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,720
replicated uh and uh and

872
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,720
churned um so really the primary free

873
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,560
RNA replication in the absence of an N20

874
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,839
SE yields an expanding population of

875
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,040
ribosy minus and plus strand fragments

876
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,760
which are being continuously

877
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,359
replicated um but the polymerase also

878
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,720
does something else you know you can see

879
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:26,720
this sort of red a section which

880
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,800
increases as as a replication goes on uh

881
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,480
there was no temp plate uh added to this

882
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,440
reaction so this is not homologous to

883
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,720
the ribosome this clearly must represent

884
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,280
the denovo generation uh of replicating

885
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,160
RNA sequences so the polymerize sort of

886
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,440
dreams of RNA sequences and begins to

887
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,480
sort of doodle and create new sequences

888
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,079
which then get replicated um and we

889
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,200
think this is probably through the

890
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,599
addition of these uh GC kind of triplet

891
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,359
pairs now when you sequence um

892
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,119
specifically these sequences you also

893
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,839
notice something interesting because

894
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,359
they have a highly uh biased sort of

895
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,720
triplet code and if you superimpose that

896
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,760
on the genetic code what is quite

897
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,400
striking is that this matches you know

898
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,640
very well with the so-called family box

899
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,400
codons which are shown here in Gray

900
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,119
which some people think is representing

901
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,520
the primordial genetic

902
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:31,359
code now this may simply be um one has

903
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,040
to be aware of if you want confirmation

904
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,440
bias because it's likely that this is at

905
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,599
least partially just a function of

906
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,680
thermodynamics because the family box

907
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:44,720
code on triplets also tend to be the

908
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:47,240
triplets which uh are bound most stably

909
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,839
kind of to the template but what

910
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,400
certainly is true is that this type of

911
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,680
open and ended and unbiased RNA

912
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,920
replication generates sequences which

913
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,440
are inherently biased to be translatable

914
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,599
because they have they use uh uh codons

915
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,640
which may have been present and

916
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:09,000
certainly contain no

917
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:13,880
stops okay so everything I've told you

918
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,880
so far was sort of based on this

919
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,280
ribosy which I've shown you the cryoem

920
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:26,839
earlier on as I said it's a mutualistic

921
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,720
heterodimer with a um um with a inactive

922
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,920
subunit blue and here the catalytic

923
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,640
subunit it's an advanced phenotype but

924
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,960
it's complex it's a it's really kind of

925
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,839
you know quite a beast and you know it's

926
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,119
288 nucleotides long so this is going to

927
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,160
be challenging kind of for

928
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,640
self-replication if for each cycle we

929
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:49,079
have to make nearly 300

930
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,839
nucleotides and also if you think about

931
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,920
the idea that such an RNA needs to

932
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,119
emerge spontaneously from a pool of

933
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,640
random sequences it really the

934
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,680
probability is Vanishing is small so

935
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,400
here comes another Paradox you need

936
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,480
complexity for function but actually for

937
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,960
emergence what you want is

938
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,880
Simplicity and you know we we sort of

939
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,760
avoided this issue for a long time but

940
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,560
eventually we decided we had to to

941
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,599
address it and we tried to um start

942
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,560
again and do a denova selection for

943
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,839
triplet polymerize activity and this

944
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,520
time which just very small kind of RNA

945
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,560
libraries uh selecting for tripet

946
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,200
incorporation and what we got is these

947
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:34,359
sort of three small RNA motifs um which

948
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,359
emerged really from a very small kind of

949
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,359
random sequence library and show some

950
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:43,480
polymerize activity we chose we picked

951
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:46,040
one of them and evolved it further um

952
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,680
it's not an enzyme with an amazing

953
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,599
catalytic turnover but it actually has

954
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,560
very robust uh polymerize activity and

955
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,640
particularly if you compare it to the

956
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,280
original ribosy and this is all now

957
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,960
encoded in this really small domain of

958
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,240
just about 50

959
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,119
nucleotides and Eduardo the postto

960
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,920
working on that kind of like making fun

961
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,200
of sort of British understand and sort

962
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,040
of like called this the quite tiny

963
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,119
triplet polymerase ribosy so from now on

964
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,119
I'll refer to this as the QT

965
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,760
ribosy and yeah so this real a small 50

966
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,119
nucleotide RN motive with robust

967
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,800
polymerize

968
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,680
activity okay amazingly this can be

969
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,560
truncated it further although you start

970
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,240
to pay an increasing price in polymerase

971
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,640
activity but the sort of

972
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,680
qt4 is still has very accessible sorry

973
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,760
very acceptable uh polymerize

974
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,760
activity and you can now use this to

975
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,400
make other ribosy so this is just shows

976
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,119
you the synthesis of a mini Hammerhead

977
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,680
ribosy both with the the sort of defined

978
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,880
tripled substrates and with a sort of

979
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,119
random all 64 random substrates you can

980
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,359
cut out that band on the gel isol at and

981
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,359
you can show that this these ribosy made

982
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:07,880
Hammerhead riboses are actually active

983
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,960
they can cleave um um an RNA substrate

984
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,319
and they are synthesized with you know

985
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,960
really it's not such a good Fidelity

986
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,400
under those conditions but actually

987
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,359
they're very matching fidelities between

988
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,520
the QT and the more complex 5tu

989
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,520
polymerase ribosy so really the QT

990
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,400
ribosy is able to synthesize an active

991
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,440
mini Hammerhead ribosy and it has sort

992
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,760
of General um polymerize activity on a

993
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,559
number of sequences I haven't shown you

994
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,760
those kind of always with the same uh

995
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:44,200
Fidelity of about

996
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:47,119
94% okay so now we've got a polymerize

997
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,319
ribosy which is small which is actually

998
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,040
has robust polymerize activity um now

999
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:57,319
the question is now can it make

1000
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,680
itself and really those are the two um

1001
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:01,520
uh component reactions of

1002
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,000
self-replication you need the minus

1003
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,640
strand synthesis where the plus strand

1004
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,359
the folded QT plus strand uses itself

1005
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,079
another plus strand as a template to

1006
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:14,440
make another minus strand that's the

1007
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,480
minus strand synthesis and then for the

1008
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,720
plus strand synthesis you need the plus

1009
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,800
strand the folded QT to use its

1010
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,440
complementary strand the minus strand to

1011
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,839
template the synthesis of another plus

1012
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,720
strand uh copy so I'm going to first

1013
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:30,319
talk

1014
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,160
about the minus strand synthesis now if

1015
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,800
you think about it here's another

1016
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,119
paradoxical requirement this is now you

1017
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,319
need the QT plus strand to use itself as

1018
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,800
a template so in this reaction the plus

1019
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,920
strand needs to be both ribozyme and

1020
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,559
template at the same time so how can you

1021
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,720
how can you affect this that it is both

1022
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:55,119
a string and a thing again is it's both

1023
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,520
folded and unfolded at the same time

1024
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,000
again the triplets come to the rest

1025
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,520
because as I told you before the

1026
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,160
triplets can invade secondary structure

1027
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:08,359
so you can have this state where it is

1028
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:12,599
both unfolded unfolded as part of an RNA

1029
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:15,119
confirmational ensembl which is um which

1030
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,880
is essentially affected by triplet

1031
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,640
concentration so at low triplet

1032
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,520
concentration you can see you have two

1033
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,000
copies of the plus strand they're both

1034
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,280
folded nothing happens but as you

1035
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,480
increase the triplet concentration an

1036
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,920
increasing population of Plus strands

1037
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,000
unfolds and becomes coated by the

1038
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,640
triplets um and then can be used as a

1039
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,079
template to synthesize at the minor

1040
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,000
Strand and if you go too high with the

1041
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,200
triplets eventually all the strands are

1042
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,280
unfolded and there's no more activity

1043
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,920
and you can see this on this gel this is

1044
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,640
a sort of a polymerase ribosy activity

1045
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,920
as a function of tripet concentration

1046
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,520
you can see there's quite a sharp

1047
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,680
transition where all the strands begin

1048
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,520
to unfold and and and where you lose all

1049
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,200
activity

1050
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,920
so really the triple concentration

1051
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,119
allows you to control the confirmational

1052
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,520
Ensemble to shift the equilibrium from

1053
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:09,680
ribosy active to template inactive

1054
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,040
confirmation and if you're at the right

1055
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,319
position you have a sort of a population

1056
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,960
which contains both folded and unfolded

1057
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,960
plus Strand and then you can synthesize

1058
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,599
a copy of the minus strand you can see

1059
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,839
this here this is the full length band

1060
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:28,319
and again you can sequence this and

1061
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:30,400
again we get about 94% % Fidelity so the

1062
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,319
first component reaction of

1063
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:37,200
self-replication can be preceded so the

1064
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:39,559
qt4 ribosy can synthesize a ful length

1065
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,800
minus strand copy from a plus strand

1066
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:42,800
template using random

1067
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,119
substrates now we come to the plus

1068
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,160
strand synthesis now here's the same

1069
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,440
problem now the ground state of you know

1070
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,359
incubating a plus and a minus strand

1071
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,960
together as I first told you before is

1072
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,520
an RNA duplex this is incredibly stable

1073
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,119
so we need to dissociate that and as I

1074
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,960
told you before the triplets allow us to

1075
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,040
stabilize the dissociated state and at

1076
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:12,240
the right sort of concentration you have

1077
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,160
um um you have in the dissociated state

1078
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,040
you have some minus strands coated with

1079
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,839
triplets obviously also some plus

1080
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,319
strands coated with triplets but also

1081
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,880
some plus strands folded that can then

1082
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,280
use the minus strand as a substrate to

1083
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,160
synthesize more PR Strand and again if

1084
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,520
you go too high everything gets coated

1085
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,720
by triplets and there is no

1086
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,520
activity but unfortunately there is an

1087
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:39,280
other equilibrium going on and that is

1088
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,800
what happens is if the polymerase if the

1089
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,400
polymerase ribosy the plus Transit

1090
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:48,400
concentration here is just a little bit

1091
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,040
too high it the the ribosy can compete

1092
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,040
effectively with the triplets to strip

1093
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,920
the triplets of the minor Strand and

1094
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,559
everything kind of goes back um to the

1095
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,480
dlex which is inactive and kills the

1096
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,200
reaction and this is sort of shown here

1097
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,920
that by increasing the plus uh

1098
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,040
concentration you get less and less

1099
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,640
product

1100
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,480
formed and this sort of shows this

1101
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:16,280
equilibrium as the plus strand

1102
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,720
concentration increases um you more and

1103
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,079
more effectively compete with the

1104
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:24,839
triplets until you basically fold just

1105
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:28,040
plus Strand and the uh the duplex so we

1106
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:30,400
thought that one way to fix this would

1107
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,880
be instead of using triplets we need to

1108
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,319
use a substrate just in this case that

1109
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,800
where that competes more effectively

1110
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:40,160
with the plus strand for binding to the

1111
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:43,680
minus Strand and we um and this is

1112
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:47,599
particularly the case for the uh an au

1113
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,280
kind of appical loop in the ribosy that

1114
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,400
um where the triplets kind of do not

1115
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,359
bind very stably to the template and

1116
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,920
therefore this is single stranded and

1117
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,559
sort of prone to Invasion uh by the plus

1118
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,359
strand and yes if we add a hexamer that

1119
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,319
sort of blocks off this vulnerable site

1120
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,800
we now can get full length plus strand

1121
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:07,920
synthesis so again the tripet

1122
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,400
concentration allows controls of the

1123
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,119
Strand confirmations and the hexamer

1124
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,760
substrate complementary to the appical a

1125
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:19,160
loop reduces the duplex formation and

1126
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,319
now enables the QT 45 plus strand

1127
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,680
synthesis this is kind of coming to the

1128
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:25,680
end of my talk just to show you here

1129
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,559
it's a weak band but we can also make

1130
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,680
the plus strand synthesis so really the

1131
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:33,640
QT can complement can complete sorry uh

1132
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,920
both of the component reactions of

1133
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,680
self-replication and we're sort of you

1134
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,160
know excited kind of you know to take

1135
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,359
this to the next step and go hopefully

1136
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,079
to a fully kind of self-replicating

1137
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:48,040
system that can begin uh to evolve so as

1138
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,160
a summary kind of like I've been you

1139
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:53,559
know trying to tell you kind of like how

1140
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,440
triplets really have some very favorable

1141
00:48:53,559 --> 00:49:00,000
properties to enable RNA catalyzed RNA

1142
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:03,760
replic ation to promote it by opening up

1143
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,559
template secondary structures for

1144
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,720
replication by attenuating strand reing

1145
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,440
after duplex melting so it really solves

1146
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,319
the Strand separation Problem by what I

1147
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,119
would call substrate assisted strand

1148
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,400
separation it enables these

1149
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,920
non-canonical RNA replication modes I've

1150
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,559
shown you the reverse and the primer

1151
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,760
free but you may appreciate that with

1152
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,559
triplets you also potentially have three

1153
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,480
different registers in which you can

1154
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:29,680
synthesize RNA

1155
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,920
it improves replication Fidelity by the

1156
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,760
sort of systems level triplet anti-t

1157
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,640
triplet interactions in the pool and it

1158
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,160
enables this open-ended primary free RNA

1159
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,799
replication and the noo generation of

1160
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,359
RNA sequence

1161
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:47,640
pools and then the small QT ribosy

1162
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,920
really now achieves the complex RNA

1163
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,319
polymerize ribosy phenotype in a much

1164
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,480
smaller motive just 45

1165
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:58,720
nucleotides

1166
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,599
um and is a able to of General RNA

1167
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,960
templated RNA synthesis with good

1168
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,000
Fidelity at

1169
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,960
94% and is able to complete the two

1170
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,400
reactions needed for self-replication

1171
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,680
and really for the QT we're just at the

1172
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,079
beginning because we've only done about

1173
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:18,200
18 rounds of evolution and this is

1174
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:20,480
exactly where Dave bartel's uh ribosy

1175
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,359
was it's called r18 it it was at this

1176
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,160
stage right at the beginning of the talk

1177
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:27,200
so this takes us

1178
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,079
back and finally I'd like to end with a

1179
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:33,079
with a sort of a plea to take ice

1180
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,799
seriously as a potential Prebiotic

1181
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:37,440
primordial medium where RNA could have

1182
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,920
made more sense because really if we

1183
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,760
think of our solar system as potentially

1184
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,359
a typical planetary

1185
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,920
system in the cosmos of which we now

1186
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:49,000
know there are many it's very noticeable

1187
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,319
that while liquid water is only found in

1188
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,319
any quantity on One Planet Ice is

1189
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:55,240
abundant ice is everywhere there's whole

1190
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:57,160
celestial bodies in the outer solar

1191
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,400
system made from Water Ice

1192
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:03,240
which would have substantial tic uh

1193
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,960
phase kind of like

1194
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,880
zones okay and I'd like to to to end by

1195
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,280
thanking the amazing people kind of

1196
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,079
who've done this work pretty much

1197
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,799
everything I showed to you was done by

1198
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:18,640
two amazing posts Jamie Atwater who's

1199
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:21,440
now left the lab and running his own uh

1200
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,920
group at University College London and

1201
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,640
Eduardo janni who's still uh with us uh

1202
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:31,119
in Cambridge and and also with help from

1203
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:33,680
Sam quar Kevin GOI and uh Bryce Clifton

1204
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,079
in the lab and actually also some very

1205
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,359
very able uh L&B interns which

1206
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,760
contributed to this like Joe keran

1207
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:43,079
aditia raguram and Teresa who are both

1208
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,440
here and I'd like to thank Ebe Anderson

1209
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:46,839
at arhus kind of for some great

1210
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,799
collaboration on the

1211
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:54,040
cryo um these bodies for giving us money

1212
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:54,040
and you for listening thank you

1213
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,640
so um thanks so much for the amazing

1214
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,280
talk uh any questions we prefer to give

1215
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:16,040
chance to students and po STS to ask a

1216
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,079
questions first so any questions uh you

1217
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,960
can either work to the microphone or I

1218
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,960
can just hand this to you

1219
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,920
are you guys interested at all at

1220
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:43,400
looking at quadruplet

1221
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,160
substrate codons for we did right at the

1222
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,040
beginning and I I I mentioned it briefly

1223
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,520
but it probably went over it too quickly

1224
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,319
so what happens is that you know when

1225
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,440
you look at the sort of progression from

1226
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:56,520
dinucleotides tried to quadruplets Etc

1227
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,960
as you go longer they get Incorporated

1228
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,720
more and more effectively because they

1229
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,760
bind to the template more effectively

1230
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,559
but when you then measure the Fidelity

1231
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,760
there's a very sharp drop as you go from

1232
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:06,760
triplets to

1233
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,160
quadruplets uh with quadruplets

1234
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,559
basically one of the base pairs no

1235
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,480
longer matters so that really kills the

1236
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:17,319
Fidelity so I think triplets is a sort

1237
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:21,000
of Sweet Spot uh at ambient temperatures

1238
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,000
and uh

1239
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,920
yeah there there are various clinical uh

1240
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:31,880
situations in which patients are treated

1241
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:35,559
with protein and giving them injections

1242
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:38,640
of proteins in order to um supplement

1243
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:40,880
whatever is deficient and sometimes they

1244
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,040
become resistant to that because they

1245
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,319
make antibodies to the protein right um

1246
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,599
have you considered trying to um make an

1247
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:53,760
RNA that would have the specific

1248
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:56,040
activity of a given Protein that's used

1249
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,400
clinically where that might be a

1250
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,760
substance Institute for the kind of

1251
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:06,520
situation that uh I just articulated

1252
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,480
yeah I mean I think um I think pure RNA

1253
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,000
is probably wouldn't be a great clinical

1254
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,400
substitute because it's not stable in in

1255
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,640
you know in the body kind of in the

1256
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,920
serum gets rapidly rapidly degraded

1257
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,960
modified rnas kind of can form into

1258
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,480
three-dimensional structures and you

1259
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,839
know potentially you know act as ligans

1260
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,839
like

1261
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:29,799
antibodies um they can also be Imes for

1262
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:32,160
a sort of limited set of reactions um

1263
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:35,200
but I think in most cases what happens

1264
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,119
is that so for example apers have been

1265
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:41,000
explored with chemical modifications in

1266
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:42,839
clinical trials to potentially replace

1267
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,240
antibodies but the antibodies just tend

1268
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:48,920
to win out um sort of tend to be better

1269
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,760
so I think it would depend very it would

1270
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,240
very much depend on the protein you're

1271
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,240
trying to

1272
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,480
replace actually I have a lot of

1273
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,319
questions maybe I'll try to ask three to

1274
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,640
begin with if no one has a questions um

1275
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:07,559
so the first one is uh regarding the

1276
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:10,240
evolution of the um ribos do you think

1277
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:13,359
um the template free replication is

1278
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,079
actually its own invidual Evolution

1279
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:20,839
system which means if you begin with a

1280
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:23,440
PO R polymerase that relatively AO prone

1281
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:27,079
and then if it's replicating itself then

1282
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,599
whoever most catalytically potent

1283
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:31,480
will be the final products yeah no I

1284
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,520
mean this is this is what we would like

1285
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:37,960
to do we would really like to begin the

1286
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:40,079
self-replication process so you know the

1287
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,760
system should become self-optimizing and

1288
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,200
this has been literally proposed you

1289
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,559
know as you acquire mutations you know

1290
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,880
you select for better and better

1291
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:51,039
self-replication yeah they should self

1292
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:53,559
like emergence uh as the mostly

1293
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,559
efficient and the Fatal system that that

1294
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,760
would allow you emergence but but I

1295
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,200
think the the problem with the

1296
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,559
fragmentary replication is that you that

1297
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,640
you keep losing the connection between

1298
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:06,599
the pieces so even if you had you if you

1299
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,640
replicate in fragments and then assemble

1300
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,680
them and then select for function um and

1301
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:14,039
then you you would go back to the open

1302
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,680
end to to the randomly primed

1303
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:17,640
replication you then break the

1304
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:21,240
connection again between the mutations

1305
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:24,359
so I think the small ribosy we think is

1306
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:27,440
the way to go cool uh and my second

1307
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:29,440
question is um just generally do if this

1308
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,799
is indeed the true that's how things

1309
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,599
begin on Earth um do you imagine there

1310
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:39,240
will be another ribo synthesizing the

1311
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:40,640
triplate um well I mean we we had I mean

1312
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,520
I'm not sure I fully understood the

1313
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,240
question we had three motives which had

1314
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,359
triplet polymerized ribosy activity so

1315
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,480
this clearly loads there's probably that

1316
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,599
was a small RNA Library so I think if we

1317
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,599
keep selecting we would I think

1318
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,960
emergence of these small motives is

1319
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,680
really easy because they're small

1320
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,799
they're simple and the there's probably

1321
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:03,839
loads of

1322
00:56:57,799 --> 00:57:05,839
them I see um and then uh regarding the

1323
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:08,960
potential possibility of uh the

1324
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:11,880
evolution of ribosome uh ribosome in the

1325
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,400
end do you imagine there could be some

1326
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:18,400
Co evolution of R and pipe ties to

1327
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,119
extend they self replicate uh now

1328
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,640
actually synthesizing some pipetite

1329
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:26,920
products like I feel the triplet is

1330
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:29,000
already the precursor of TRNA

1331
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,599
yeah I think

1332
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,880
um I mean the in a way the evolution of

1333
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,319
translation is almost more mysterious

1334
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,920
than you know the sort of original kind

1335
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:42,920
of origin of life because you need at

1336
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,039
least three different subsystems to sort

1337
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,680
of come together to give you translation

1338
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:49,799
you need you need a reader like the

1339
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:53,039
small ribosomal subunit that tracks

1340
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:55,760
reads the sequence you need a decoding

1341
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:56,640
um adapter like the trnas and you then

1342
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,720
need the

1343
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,599
the you need you need the the peptidal

1344
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,920
transfer um now some people have

1345
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,559
speculated that the s30 subunit of the

1346
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,920
ribosome that's the old replic case that

1347
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:13,280
has become repurposed for

1348
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,200
translation uh but I I really don't know

1349
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,520
if you know I would like to speculate

1350
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,960
too much but what is very interesting is

1351
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,920
that you know the ribosome the genetic

1352
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,319
code um is a triplet code with one

1353
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,160
wobble position and that's exactly what

1354
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:29,400
we have as well with our triplets we

1355
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,119
also end up with one wubble position

1356
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,359
it's at the other side of the triplet

1357
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,559
but it's the same sort of idea yeah I

1358
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:38,200
think it's quite amazing because they go

1359
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:40,400
from either direction but then still

1360
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,680
they have this triplet like the effects

1361
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,880
at the wble position so I in fact Jamie

1362
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,559
I think has some interest in you know

1363
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:51,359
building simple uh models um of how

1364
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,599
translation might have evolved kind of

1365
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:56,920
in his lab so you know you should ask

1366
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:59,359
him maybe in a few years time

1367
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,359
any more

1368
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:07,400
questions uh sorry you do we have more

1369
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:10,920
time okay thank you uh great talk do you

1370
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:13,359
have any idea of how ribozymes can bias

1371
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:17,920
towards self-replication rather than

1372
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:20,160
replicating other uh RNA template yeah

1373
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,359
so so what you're asking is like if you

1374
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,480
have the ribosy in a soup of sequences

1375
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:28,400
how does it recognizes its kin yeah yeah

1376
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,599
I mean I think I haven't included this

1377
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,599
here but I think the the answer to that

1378
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:35,480
is the same as in Biology you need to

1379
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,280
compartmentalize so you need to have

1380
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,599
some sort of

1381
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,280
um um you know you need to sort of

1382
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,599
enclose the replication reaction into

1383
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,119
some sort of compartment which means

1384
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:49,720
kind of that the ribosy and its kin sort

1385
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,359
of stay together and these type of

1386
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,760
compartments could be many things you

1387
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:56,480
know they could be simple by layer

1388
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,000
membranes vesicles but and there's all

1389
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,160
kinds of pockets that you can have in

1390
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,559
fact I haven't shown you this but if you

1391
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,920
set up the TIC ice phase in a particular

1392
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,640
way instead of getting these channels of

1393
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,799
tic phase you actually get little

1394
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,480
inclusions so these could be even the

1395
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:13,440
TIC phase could be some sort of

1396
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:17,440
primitive you know protocellular medium

1397
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,640
and of course you can hit pockets in um

1398
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,319
sort of if you mix kind of like you know

1399
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,880
oil phases kind of unwatered type of

1400
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,680
emulsions um some people are interested

1401
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,400
in aerosols kind of that you get let's

1402
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,720
say an Ocean Spray which form like

1403
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:35,160
little droplets and so on so I think

1404
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:37,039
there's no shortage of um enclosing

1405
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,119
compartmentalization modes that one

1406
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,319
could explore but I think what we we're

1407
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,799
sort of focused on getting the

1408
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:45,359
self-replication process to work and I

1409
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:49,280
think once it's working I think we'll

1410
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,280
definitively think about exactly that

1411
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,200
problem hey there um I was curious if

1412
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,920
you could speak to any structural

1413
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:01,079
similarities you SE between the the

1414
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,799
smaller um ribozymes and the any larger

1415
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,520
ones or between the smaller ones I don't

1416
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:08,319
think we really kind of see any and I

1417
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,720
mean what is interesting is we ma the

1418
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,880
way the two riboses interact with the

1419
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,400
primer template and they seem to contact

1420
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,640
exactly the same positions on the primer

1421
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,559
template but when we try to look at the

1422
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:25,160
structure I can show you a slide that I

1423
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:27,160
sort of um have excluded um from this

1424
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,559
this is you know when we sort of try to

1425
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,680
figure out what the

1426
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:35,559
ribosy looks like by footprinting and

1427
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:37,440
sort of Fitness landscape analysis um I

1428
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:39,400
mean you can see it really kind of just

1429
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,240
looks like a hairpin and we have some

1430
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,039
preliminary cryoem data which also

1431
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,760
suggests kind of it really it's just

1432
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:49,480
kind of you know there's

1433
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:52,319
nothing nothing that looks you know like

1434
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:55,520
the other structure at all it's just

1435
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:58,920
just um you know a hairpin structure uh

1436
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:01,680
and we we definitively you know want to

1437
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,880
figure out how this thing does its job

1438
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:07,440
because at the moment it's completely

1439
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:10,319
mysterious thank

1440
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,599
you any more

1441
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:15,799
questions okay if not thanks everyone

1442
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:20,319
for coming and let's all thank uh Dr

1443
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:20,319
holik is great talk okay

1444
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:24,769
[Applause]
