1
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,320
Uh last time we talked about the picard

2
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,320
uh lindelof theorem.

3
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:32,599
And so this theorem is about uh

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,599
solutions uh to

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,640
to ODEs.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,239
And so specifically it's it's asking

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,960
that so you have a function uh f

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,960
and a function g

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,120
and uh f here is is is differentiable

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,240
and the derivative of of f as well as g

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,240
are continuous.

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,640
And then the problem is that you're

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,759
looking for solutions. So you want a

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,759
solution. So looking

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,479
for a solution

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,200
y to the OD

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,439
where the and the OD is that the

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,040
derivative

19
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:49,360
should be equal to f of y.

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,799
So at some point uh x

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:59,280
uh the derivative of y should be equal

22
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:04,079
to f of y of x plus g of x

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:09,360
and uh you are looking for that uh that

24
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:12,959
this function that y of zero say is

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,840
equal to a. Okay. So this is what's

26
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,840
called the initial condition,

27
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,080
[Applause]

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,239
right? And this is so the this is equal

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,239
to that.

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:37,920
And so in order to uh so we want ex you

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,920
uh existence. So want

32
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,920
existence

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,160
and uniqueness.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,879
So existence just means that there is a

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,599
solution for a given a there is a

36
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,480
solution. Uniqueness means that if you

37
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,000
have two solutions

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,319
uh to this uh od then they will have to

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,319
coincide.

40
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:13,440
And so uh we uh the way we were setting

41
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:17,879
it up was that we were using so using

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,879
the contracting mapping theorem.

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,519
So the contracting mapping theorem is

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,280
the following that if you take a metric

45
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,000
space

46
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:43,480
X and this metric space is so X comma D

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,480
is a metric space is a cushy

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,920
complete

49
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,640
uh metric space

50
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,040
uh then a contracting map. So a

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,040
contracting map

52
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,480
um is a map

53
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:20,120
t from this metric space into itself.

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,120
So that um um and a constant

55
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:32,600
C strictly less than one. So that if you

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,600
measure the distance between the images,

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,199
the images are squeezed together. So

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,759
this means that the the distance between

59
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,040
the images is this constant that is

60
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,759
strictly less than one times the

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,840
distance between x and y. So this is a

62
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,980
contracting map.

63
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,959
And the contracting mapping theorem say.

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,959
[Applause]

65
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,440
So the contracting mapping theorem uh is

66
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,440
is the following

67
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,440
that uh there exist if you have a cushy

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:23,199
complete metric space and you have a

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:25,360
contracting map like this then uh t

70
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,600
has

71
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,600
a unique

72
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,680
fix point

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,560
and remember that a fixed point. So a

74
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,560
fixed point

75
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:49,520
this is a x in this space so that t

76
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,680
leaves it invariant.

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,600
Okay.

78
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,840
And so we proved this we proved the

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,360
contracting mapping theorem last time.

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,440
Now

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
how were we going to use this for this

82
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,520
OD?

83
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:12,520
So we define so if if um if I here is an

84
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
interval

85
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,360
containing

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,080
containing uh

87
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:35,680
a zero. Then we defined uh

88
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:40,280
n u is a function. So n u and sorry y is

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,280
a continuous function.

90
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,360
[Applause]

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:52,240
Then we defined t of y. So this is a

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,240
continuous function on on the interval

93
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,600
on i.

94
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:02,080
Then we defined a another continuous

95
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,800
function on the same interval as follow

96
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,639
that the

97
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,599
t of y. So this is going to be a

98
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,400
continuous function.

99
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:18,199
So in in x

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,199
this thing here is this is a

101
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,599
because we want it to have value at zero

102
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,280
a and then we're integrating from zero

103
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:32,479
to x of f

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:36,960
of uh y of s

105
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,759
plus g of s

106
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,639
ds Right.

107
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:47,599
And so this

108
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,599
so this here gives you a map from t

109
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,800
gives you a map from the continuous

110
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,560
function on this interval into the

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,759
continuous function on the interval.

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,400
And it also has the property that if you

113
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,280
take a function

114
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,160
and you evaluate it at zero then you get

115
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,080
a

116
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:20,479
okay. And now we observe that in fact

117
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,680
this the image here

118
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,160
the image is if you define when you

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,199
define it like this by the fundamental

120
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,680
theorem of calculus this function here

121
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,680
is differentiable.

122
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:44,480
So this function is so it actually takes

123
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,800
so t actually takes

124
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,920
the space of continuous functions

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,160
into the space of functions that are not

126
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
just continuous but actually

127
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,880
differentiable

128
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,760
and even the derivative is continuous

129
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,440
and the ones that are

130
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,000
um so this here is a space of functions.

131
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,000
So this is functions

132
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:19,160
that are um that are where where the

133
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,160
functions y so that y prime exist

134
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,800
and is continuous.

135
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Okay.

136
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,279
So

137
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,440
right and so now what we saw last time

138
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,440
was that by the fundamental theorem of

139
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
calculus

140
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,200
of calculus.

141
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,200
Um

142
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,200
the derivative

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:09,519
Right? So by the fundamental therm

144
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:13,519
calculus the derivative of this function

145
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,760
if you take y and you take t of it this

146
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,800
is now a function and it's

147
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,680
differentiable and the derivative is f

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:28,959
of y.

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:33,120
So at x it's f of y of x plus g of x.

150
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,000
And so this means that if so if

151
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,320
y

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,920
is a fixed point

153
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,399
for the map t. So if it's a fixed point,

154
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,000
this just means that t of y is equal to

155
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,040
y. Well then

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,240
then this thing here is the derivative

157
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,720
of y. So then it means that y here

158
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,720
solves the

159
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:08,000
right. We have already checked that the

160
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,320
initial value we did that uh somewhere

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,959
here we already checked that the initial

162
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,640
value is what it should be and if it's a

163
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,680
fixed point then the derivative is also

164
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,320
what it should be. Right?

165
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,440
Okay. So we want to find a fixed point

166
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,680
and so what we did last time was that we

167
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,279
saw that if we if we restrict the

168
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,839
interval.

169
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,839
So last time

170
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,959
what we proved is that if we restrict

171
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,440
the interval. So last time we showed

172
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,440
so we set

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:54,720
m here equal to a absolute value of a +

174
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,560
2.

175
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,560
And then we saw that there exist a delta

176
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,560
zero

177
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,120
at delta zero greater than zero. So that

178
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,200
such that

179
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,959
if you restrict to the interval if

180
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,839
you're looking at the interval of

181
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,760
continuous function so the interval of

182
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,440
continuous function on this little

183
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,480
interval.

184
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,600
So this is a interval around zero and

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,360
you're looking at this map.

186
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,760
Then this map here well first of all we

187
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,600
already know that it takes this the

188
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,160
space of continuous function into the

189
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,360
space of continuous function. But we

190
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,120
have something more that we have that if

191
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:49,360
you're looking at the subspace of this

192
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,360
which is a space of functions y that are

193
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
here

194
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,360
and you also require that the norm here

195
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,279
is lesser equal to m.

196
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,440
Then takes

197
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,839
this space here into itself. Right? This

198
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:15,760
is this lema that we proved last time,

199
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:20,079
right? And and so okay.

200
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,079
So so this this space here, right? You

201
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,200
can think about this space here as we

202
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,200
did last time as then we defined we

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
defined

204
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,079
we define

205
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:39,920
uh capital R equal to

206
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,639
uh no actually so we we defined uh we

207
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,200
looked at the balls I guess just on on

208
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,120
this so we looked at the ball of

209
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:54,720
freighers capital n

210
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:58,399
in in in this around the zero function.

211
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,800
So this thing here is the closed ball

212
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,199
in the space of continuous function with

213
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,240
the metric that we've been using and

214
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:10,440
this set here we can think about if we

215
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,440
want as this set. Okay.

216
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,480
Okay. So now what we have is so we have

217
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,880
so the setup now is that we want to find

218
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:30,320
a fixed point for this map T right we

219
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,720
have a space that we want to look at and

220
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,120
the space is again now we're going to

221
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,519
think about so just to so this is the

222
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,560
space we're looking at but this is what

223
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,760
we before have denoted like the ball in

224
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,839
this metric space it's a centered at the

225
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,199
function function that is constant zero

226
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:56,639
and this is the radius right

227
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:59,360
and so I'm I'm now looking at this

228
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:04,399
this map so we have now shown that it

229
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:07,519
take this metric ball into itself okay

230
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,079
and I want to find a fixed point want to

231
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
find a fix

232
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,720
fixed point

233
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,199
of t.

234
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,440
Okay. So I need to I need to show So we

235
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,920
want to show

236
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,920
want to show

237
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,000
that T

238
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,000
is a contracting map,

239
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,040
right? Because if it is a contracting

240
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:55,560
map, then we already know that if you

241
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,560
take a closed interval like this

242
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,440
and you equip it with the usual distance

243
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,839
that we have, this here is this here is

244
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,839
cushy complete,

245
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,279
right? But now if you take a cushy

246
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,000
complete space and you're taking a

247
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,800
closed subset and this here is a closed

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,199
subset then this here is also cushy

249
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,199
complete this here is also

250
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,440
okay. So if we could prove that t from

251
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,839
this space into itself is a contracting

252
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,399
map. So it means that the existence C

253
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,120
strictly less than one. Then we would

254
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,240
have a fixed point and we would have a

255
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,800
solution to the OD. Right? The thing is

256
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,120
that this is not quite going to do it.

257
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:05,320
It's not quite a contracting map,

258
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:05,320
but so so we will need so for it

259
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,480
to be

260
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,480
a contracting map.

261
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,400
We need to restrict

262
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,199
the interval

263
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
further.

264
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,960
Okay. So by that I mean that we so we

265
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:44,240
need to find we need to

266
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,880
we need a delta to be

267
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,760
we need to show that there's some delta

268
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,080
it will actually be less than so we need

269
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,640
to show that there's some delta that is

270
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,760
smaller than this delta zero and so that

271
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,559
if you restrict to this space here now

272
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,039
it's a continuous function I won't

273
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,160
define the I won't I will denote the

274
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,559
ball by the same but this here is

275
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,760
actually a ball in a different metric

276
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,520
space because this is now a ball in the

277
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,520
continuous functions on this smaller

278
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,520
interval.

279
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,559
Okay, but it's for the same radius.

280
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,520
Okay, so if we restrict the map to this

281
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,720
space here then on this it is a

282
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,559
contracting map. Okay. So we need to cut

283
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:39,679
down the interval. Uh

284
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:44,000
okay. So now how do we do that? So

285
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:49,640
so we need a contracting property again.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,640
And so suppose you take two functions.

287
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,960
These are continuous maps

288
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,960
on some interval say from

289
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,960
right here again delta is now that's the

290
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,720
delta we're looking for and it would be

291
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,080
smaller than delta zero so since it's

292
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,480
smaller than delta zero we already know

293
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,200
that t that so we have two maps like

294
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,679
this they are both supposed to be in the

295
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,120
ball so this means that this thing here

296
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,679
is less than m and we know we have

297
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,840
already proven just because delta is

298
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:34,480
less than delta zero that t of this

299
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,640
function here

300
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,440
has norm less or equal to m. Okay. So,

301
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,640
but now let's look at the difference.

302
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:50,559
So, t of y1

303
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:53,360
uh of x minus t of y2

304
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,039
of x,

305
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,360
right? And then we're interested in the

306
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,360
norm here.

307
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,160
And I and now x here is in this smaller

308
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,160
interval.

309
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,760
Okay. So now let's just write down what

310
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,200
the map is. So the map here is the

311
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:21,600
integral. So it's a sorry it's a plus

312
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:23,360
the integral from zero to x of f of y1

313
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,360
s

314
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:30,000
plus g of s

315
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,480
d s

316
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,679
minus

317
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:44,880
a + the integral from zero to x of f of

318
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:48,559
y 2 s + G of S

319
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,280
DS, right?

320
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,559
And now you see that the A's cancel,

321
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,960
right? The A's here cancel

322
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:02,559
and the G of S that those also cancel

323
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,000
out, right? So you left with that this

324
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:15,600
thing here is the absolute value of the

325
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:22,159
integral from 0 to x of f of um y1 of s

326
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:25,360
minus uh um f of y2

327
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,600
of s

328
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
ds.

329
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,080
Now

330
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,080
we

331
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,000
So last time

332
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:58,320
when we proved that at the map

333
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,360
He takes this ball into this ball we

334
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,679
used we defined. So let me just define

335
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:10,559
that again. We defined L1

336
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:14,400
and N1 was the the maximum

337
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:17,400
of actually uh

338
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,400
uh

339
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,840
um

340
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,360
I don't remember whether it was called

341
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:32,159
L1. Let me just call it L uh to not call

342
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,480
it some. So uh L here is the maximum of

343
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:39,120
FP prime

344
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,600
um of of offset

345
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:47,600
where set here

346
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:51,919
has no less or equal to M. Okay.

347
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,520
So this is so f prime exists and is

348
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,640
continuous. So on this interval here it

349
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,960
has a maximum. Okay. So it's a nice

350
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:06,240
finite number. And so now we use the so

351
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,039
by the mean value theorem

352
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,039
the mean value theorem.

353
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,840
By the mean value theorem, we have that

354
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:25,919
f of set one

355
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:28,000
minus f of set 2. As long as set one and

356
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,400
set two

357
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,600
are uh are in the interval from minus m

358
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,440
to m. Then we have that this difference

359
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:44,000
here is equal to the derivative in some

360
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:48,080
intermediate point set sigma

361
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,840
s I guess s times the difference between

362
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,000
the two set one minus set two. So we

363
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,840
have this right this is the mean math

364
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,280
theorem

365
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:04,120
and so we have that uh therefore we have

366
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,120
that the norm here of the difference

367
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,360
is bounded by this here when we take the

368
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,520
absolute value of this we're getting the

369
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,080
absolute value. So this here is is equal

370
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:23,080
to the absolute value of frime sigma

371
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,080
time z 1 minus z 2.

372
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,799
This thing here

373
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,720
because these two are in this interval

374
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:36,279
this is bounded by by capital L. So

375
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,279
you're getting this.

376
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,520
And so now if you use this fact here

377
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,000
[Applause]

378
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,240
and you use this on this. So this thing

379
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,480
here is less or equal to the integral

380
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,720
from zero to x and I can take the

381
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,799
absolute value in under the integration

382
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,840
sign. So I get f of y1

383
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:05,039
s minus

384
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,799
uh f of y2

385
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,760
s

386
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,559
ds right

387
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,880
and so now I can continue this string so

388
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:22,159
I have what I'm interested in is g of y1

389
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:25,200
at x minus g of y2

390
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,240
of x and I'm interested in the abs bound

391
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,440
for the absolute value and I have that

392
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:37,200
this is less or equal to the integral

393
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:42,400
from 0 to x of f of y1

394
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,320
s plus f of y 2

395
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
s

396
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,600
ds

397
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,960
and now I know that this interval here

398
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,720
right x is supposed to lie in this

399
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,880
interval here so this means is that that

400
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,279
this the length of this interval from

401
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:07,279
zero to is at most delta. So delta and

402
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,720
then I can take the maximum of this

403
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,760
or I can take the uh that's right I can

404
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,799
take the the maximum of this but you see

405
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:21,760
that this thing here is bounded by so

406
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:25,039
this is the maximum is the maximum

407
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,640
and if I use this inequality here it's

408
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:31,520
bounded by L and then it's applied this

409
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,480
here you should think about as set one

410
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,640
and this here for each x you can s you

411
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,520
can think about this as set one and set

412
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,039
two and so you're getting this thing

413
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,400
here times y1

414
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:50,000
s - y 2

415
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,600
s and here s will now lie in the

416
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,520
interval

417
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,400
um

418
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,120
in this interval here

419
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,840
oops

420
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,360
Right? And so now you see that this is

421
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:09,840
just a constant. So this is equal to

422
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:14,000
delta L. And then this maximum

423
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,240
S lesser equal to delta

424
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,480
Y1

425
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,320
minus Y2

426
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:26,559
like this. Right? This is evaluated in

427
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,279
S. But I wouldn't I don't write that.

428
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,000
Okay? And this thing here. But this is

429
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:37,919
just delta L. This maximum here is just

430
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,840
the distance between this function and

431
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,080
that function. That's how we define this

432
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,200
distance. Right?

433
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,279
And so you see that this right hand side

434
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,240
is now holds for all x. So this means

435
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,880
that we have that the maximum of this

436
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,960
thing here over x where x is in the

437
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,000
interval between zero and delta. So this

438
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,279
means that we have that the distance

439
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,120
between t of y1

440
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,720
and t of y2.

441
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,559
This thing here is equal to the maximum.

442
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,799
This is how we define that distance

443
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,799
after all.

444
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,039
Um and then it's of this thing here

445
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:35,919
sorry uh x

446
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,480
minus t of y 2

447
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,039
in x

448
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,080
right so we have that this and this

449
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,600
inequality say that it's less or equal

450
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:53,760
to

451
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:57,840
delta uh L D Y1 comma Y2

452
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,200
and so you see that now if you so L here

453
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,760
was just a fixed constant right if I now

454
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,760
set delta just to make sure that there's

455
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,399
no problem I'm setting delta equal to 1

456
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,880
/ 2 L I don't really need the one but I

457
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,919
I I'll just do it like this so I don't

458
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,640
have zero in the denominator if I choose

459
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:23,520
the delta to be equal to this. Right?

460
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,240
Well, then you see that this thing here

461
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,200
the the inner product of these two is

462
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,480
less or the the product of these two is

463
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:38,120
less than a half. So this is less or

464
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,120
equal to I can just place it by a half

465
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,320
like that. Right?

466
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,399
And so you see this is exactly what it

467
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,720
means to be a contracting mapping. In

468
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,799
fact, it's a contracting mapping which

469
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,720
is pretty nice

470
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,559
that the constant it's not just strictly

471
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,640
some constant strictly less than one but

472
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,799
it's actually a half right. So it's a

473
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,520
contracting mapping theorem a

474
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,760
contracting map and so now by the

475
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,399
contracting mapping theorem we have a

476
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,960
fixed point. Okay.

477
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:15,840
So this solve the OD. Okay. And it do

478
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,080
does more than that because a

479
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,480
contracting mapping theorem says that it

480
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,520
has a unique

481
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,279
uh unique fix point. Right? So this

482
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,399
means that and and if you have a

483
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,399
solution to this, right? If you have a

484
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:35,039
solution to this, then we saw last time

485
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,520
that if it is a solution, then it is a

486
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,200
fixed point, right?

487
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,360
Okay. So now we almost have existence

488
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,000
and uniqueness.

489
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,559
Uh let me explain what is missing to the

490
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,559
existence of uniqueness.

491
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:59,080
So for that

492
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,080
let me

493
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,159
backtrack a little bit and talk about

494
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,159
something about metric spaces.

495
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,039
bases specifically uh about connected

496
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,039
matrix bases.

497
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,000
Okay. So suppose you have a metric space

498
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,399
then we say

499
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,679
that

500
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,679
It is connected

501
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:55,039
if um if x here is the only subset

502
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,799
only subset. So, so the whole set itself

503
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:04,240
is the only subset

504
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:08,760
of of X that is

505
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,760
is both open and closed.

506
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,080
Right? Remember that if you take a

507
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:25,440
metric space then the sorry if

508
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:27,600
if X and sorry and and the empty set are

509
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,559
the only

510
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,480
uh subset of X that are both open and

511
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,600
closed. Right? Remember that if you take

512
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,519
a metric space and if you take the whole

513
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,320
set or the empty set, those are all

514
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,159
they're both always closed and open,

515
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,679
right? And so it's connected if those

516
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:54,399
are the only two subsets that are at the

517
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:57,760
same time open and closed. Okay?

518
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:02,720
And so now

519
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,720
we have that we have the following

520
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:11,399
we have the following lema

521
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,399
or theorem just call it theorem

522
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:19,919
that if you take a interval here with a

523
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,320
usual metric here so this is so I here

524
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,320
is a interval

525
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:37,120
then uh the theorem is that that that

526
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:40,120
uh this metric space here so is

527
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,120
connected.

528
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,840
Okay. So let's try to prove that.

529
00:33:52,799 --> 00:34:00,159
So I take now a subset

530
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,679
here uh that is

531
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:07,799
is both open

532
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,799
open and closed.

533
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,879
And we want to show

534
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,879
want to show

535
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,040
that

536
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:24,320
if a here is non- empty

537
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,800
then it implies that a

538
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,040
is is everything. Right? So we're

539
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,720
assuming that it's non- empty and then

540
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,200
we should apply uh to try to prove that

541
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,200
a is everything.

542
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,159
So we let

543
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,839
x0 be an element in a right but right

544
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,679
we're assuming it's not empty so we can

545
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,480
let x0 be an element in a

546
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:55,079
and now I want to define

547
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,079
um I want to

548
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,599
I want to so I have here I have here my

549
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,760
interval this is my interval I

550
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:12,400
have here x0

551
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,400
and I take uh and I'm looking at the the

552
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
y

553
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,680
uh in

554
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,720
in a

555
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:27,920
so that um

556
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:32,240
that if you take everything

557
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:36,400
uh so that so y is an a and I'm going to

558
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:40,400
look at y in a with

559
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:44,480
y bigger equal to x0 and I'm going to

560
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:49,119
look at the y so that that this whole

561
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,680
interval here from x0 to y

562
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,119
is contained in a

563
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,440
so I'm defining so

564
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,440
so define

565
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,800
as subset here

566
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,960
B

567
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,960
of of I

568
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:24,720
so that uh it's the y this subset b is

569
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:30,560
the y in a with a property that it is

570
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:32,800
that y here is big or equal to x0 and

571
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:38,400
and you have

572
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:41,359
And this interval here

573
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,359
is contained in a

574
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,359
okay

575
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,480
and now I want to show that so let's say

576
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,320
let's say for the sake of argument let

577
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,040
me assume

578
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,680
that this interval is a closed interval

579
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,320
like this it works equally well the

580
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,160
argument with obvious modification

581
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:11,240
work each equally well if it's open or

582
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,240
half open uh interval.

583
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,680
Okay. So I take some y here and I have

584
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,680
so I have a y

585
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,920
and I and y is so it's a set so that

586
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,440
this whole interval is contained in a

587
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,400
okay

588
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,400
and what I want to show is so want to

589
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,400
show

590
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:52,079
that y is in a And this is the first

591
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,960
thing I want to show. One is that y is

592
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,880
in a

593
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,560
and then I want the second thing I want

594
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,440
to show is that y

595
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,920
is equal to b.

596
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,720
You see if I had proven both of these

597
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:13,920
property right then it would be that so

598
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:19,119
then um then

599
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:22,960
um it would mean that everything here

600
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,440
would be in a and including this last

601
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,880
point right and so this means that we

602
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,440
have this entire interval is in a is in

603
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,040
I sorry and then likewise we could argue

604
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:39,440
on the other side Okay.

605
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:46,000
So now how do we prove this? So

606
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:51,520
well the first thing is that if if um

607
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:56,079
if we take so if we set

608
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,560
sorry this is no sorry but that's this

609
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,880
here should have been

610
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,280
this here should have been y zero and

611
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,119
this should have been the soup

612
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,119
of y in Okay.

613
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,320
So these guys

614
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:22,079
and then this here and we want to prove

615
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:24,640
that this thing here is in in a

616
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,640
and uh and the second thing is we want

617
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,960
to prove that this soup is actually

618
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,960
equal to B. Okay, that's what we want to

619
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,960
prove.

620
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:42,560
So the soup of these well if you have if

621
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:46,079
y z is a soup of elements then you have

622
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,240
a sequence. So here you have y z and

623
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,160
this means that you have a sequence of

624
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,240
elements

625
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:58,079
which are then in elements in the set B.

626
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,920
This is soup of B.

627
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:05,280
Mine is the same as soup of B. Sorry,

628
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,000
soup of B.

629
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,720
I write like this.

630
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,119
So I take this set and these are the Y

631
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,880
so that this entire interval is

632
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:22,560
contained in a right and then I take the

633
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:26,560
soup of this set and I want to prove

634
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,520
that this soup is in A. And then I want

635
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,520
to prove that in fact the soup is B.

636
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Okay.

637
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:40,560
So that it's a soup of of such

638
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:43,200
elements in capital B means that there

639
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,320
exists a sequence

640
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,400
of elements

641
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:54,720
in B.

642
00:40:48,400 --> 00:41:00,000
So, so that y here y0

643
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:03,599
is the soup of b. This here implies that

644
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,839
there exist a sequence y

645
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,720
and these yn

646
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:12,319
are in a and you have that

647
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,920
x0

648
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,520
y

649
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:22,400
is contained in a and and then you have

650
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,880
that these guys converge to y z.

651
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,160
Right? This is what you get from that is

652
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,160
a soup. Right? These two things are that

653
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,440
the elements

654
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:39,319
are in that these elements. So this here

655
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,319
is just that's the y in on b.

656
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,160
Okay.

657
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,359
So now what you have so this here means

658
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,440
so here I have x0

659
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:55,440
here I have y z and I have these uh

660
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,839
these elements

661
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,599
y in

662
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:05,520
and they are in particular they are in a

663
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,000
okay but a is closed right since a is

664
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,440
closed since

665
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,599
y is in a

666
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,160
and

667
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,319
Y in and a is closed

668
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,079
is a closed

669
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:28,000
is a closed subset.

670
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:31,280
This means that that the limit here the

671
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,400
limit y z which is the limit this here

672
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:39,440
must also be in a right.

673
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,160
Okay. So we have proven the first

674
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,160
property right

675
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,800
we proven that that right so well so

676
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:56,480
we've proven that y0 is in a but now you

677
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:01,040
see that we have that for each of the y

678
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:05,280
in we have that this interval here lie

679
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,200
in a right and they converge to this so

680
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,040
it means that if you take anything to

681
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,920
the left

682
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,760
of y0. Well, then eventually there's

683
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:18,160
some y in to the right of that and so

684
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,000
this whole interval is in a right. So

685
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:26,640
you see that this it now means that not

686
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,119
only is y z in a but y z is really in

687
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,119
the set b.

688
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,119
Okay,

689
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,680
this here only used that A was closed,

690
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,640
right?

691
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,640
So now we need to use that A is open,

692
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,640
right?

693
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:51,839
[Applause]

694
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,640
So now

695
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:59,640
suppose we take a element

696
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,640
suppose. So now here we have x0

697
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:08,079
we have here b and we want to show that

698
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:12,079
this y0 we define to be the soup of this

699
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:15,200
set capital b. We want to prove that

700
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:17,040
this thing here is in fact y zero.

701
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,480
Right?

702
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,520
Suppose not suppose that suppose not. So

703
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,920
suppose that you have here strictly

704
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,920
between these two this here is y z

705
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:37,520
now we already know that y0

706
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:39,119
is in a. This is what we proved here.

707
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,800
Right?

708
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:47,920
So but since since

709
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,160
um uh a here is open

710
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,400
there exist some tiny little interval

711
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,400
there exist

712
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:01,920
some interval here

713
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:04,560
around this y z. So if you take y z and

714
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,160
you subtract this epsilon

715
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,839
so there exists some epsilon greater

716
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,640
than zero. So that if you're looking at

717
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,640
this tiny little interval centered at y

718
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,640
z

719
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,000
then this here is contained in a. This

720
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,599
is just because a was open right.

721
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,160
But this means that that now you have

722
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,680
that. So this here is you assume this is

723
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:33,280
y z. So you have that this thing here

724
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,440
lie in the set capital A and this here I

725
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,160
guarantee you that you can actually go a

726
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,040
little bit past it right that even if

727
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,079
you go a little bit past it if you go a

728
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,359
little bit past it here then these are

729
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,880
still in A right so this means that this

730
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:54,720
could not be the soup right so therefore

731
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,040
this point here had to be B right it had

732
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,520
to be the final point.

733
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,599
Okay, so this proved these two property,

734
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,640
right? And so once you have these two

735
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,400
property, you have that the interval is

736
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,599
connected, right? That the only non-enty

737
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:16,000
subset of the interval that is both open

738
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:20,480
and closed is itself. Okay.

739
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,480
Now why is this related to what we want?

740
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:28,680
So this is just so we have

741
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,680
suppose you take two functions.

742
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,880
So why is this related to the uniqueness

743
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,160
for the OD?

744
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,160
So this is the following lema.

745
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,920
Suppose you have a interval. So this is

746
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,040
a interval

747
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,280
in R and suppose you have two functions

748
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:57,119
U1 and U2

749
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:01,480
they're functions on the interval

750
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,480
and they are both continuous

751
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:09,319
and then assume that for some assume

752
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,760
that

753
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:18,640
for some X0 0

754
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:25,200
in the interval

755
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:29,560
uh u 1 of x0 is equal to u2 of x0. So

756
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,560
they coincide in one point.

757
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,079
And assume you have a second condition.

758
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,520
And the second condition is

759
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:42,960
that if

760
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:49,520
uh if u

761
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:54,680
uh of u1 of x is equal to u2

762
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,680
of x then there exist

763
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:02,079
there exist

764
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,839
a neighborhood so a epsilon

765
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,839
where this is allowed. not to depend on

766
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:13,119
x.

767
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:18,000
So that uh u 1 is equal to u2 in not

768
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:25,920
just at x but actually uh on this little

769
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:27,920
interval x minus epsilon x + epsilon.

770
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,800
Okay. So you have these two properties.

771
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:35,040
So you have two continuous functions on

772
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,920
an interval. They agree at one point and

773
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,640
if they agree at any point in this

774
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,200
interval then they agree on a little

775
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,960
neighborhood of that point. Okay. But

776
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,160
the neighborhood may depend on the

777
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:52,680
point. Okay. And then the statement is

778
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,680
so the claim is that

779
00:48:53,599 --> 00:49:01,000
that U1

780
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,000
is actually equal to U2 everywhere.

781
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:12,400
in in the interval where they defined.

782
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:17,160
Okay, that's a claim. Okay. And so now

783
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,160
you see that if you take

784
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,200
if you're looking at so the proof of

785
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:32,359
this is

786
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,359
that suppose so proof

787
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,000
suppose you define a function

788
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:46,400
uh and this function here is u1 of x

789
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:49,920
minus u2 of x. If you define it like

790
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,319
this, u1 and u2 are continuous. So f

791
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,319
here is continuous.

792
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:05,839
You also have that f of x0. Well, this

793
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:08,400
is u1 of x0 minus u2 of x0.

794
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:11,760
And these two function coincided at x0.

795
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:15,760
So this is zero.

796
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:20,960
You also have that if f ofx

797
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:23,960
so if f of x is equal to zero.

798
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,960
Well

799
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:33,599
right now then then you have by this

800
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,480
second property here this property here.

801
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,280
So if f is zero this is just meaning

802
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:43,040
that the two function coincided at that

803
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,960
x just means that there exist they exist

804
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,520
a delta

805
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,440
epsilon sorry epsilon greater than zero

806
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,440
such that

807
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:58,000
uh f

808
00:50:51,440 --> 00:51:01,000
um of um of y is equal to zero in this

809
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
little

810
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:07,280
interval around

811
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,800
X and so you have that

812
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:14,319
and now I claim that so now the claim is

813
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:18,720
that the zero set so the set where the

814
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:20,720
function f is zero this is both open and

815
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,680
closed.

816
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,680
So the claim here is

817
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,559
that that the set

818
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:37,200
u capital a

819
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:42,160
this is the set of x in the interval

820
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:46,640
where f of x is equal to zero

821
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:49,440
that this here is both

822
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,440
open and closed.

823
00:51:52,880 --> 00:52:00,000
Right? We already know that this set

824
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,240
this is follow up here that that x0 is

825
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,720
so since

826
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:11,280
since x0 is in this set then we have and

827
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:14,920
the integral is connected and

828
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,920
I is connected.

829
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:22,960
If this set is both open and closed,

830
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:25,680
then we have that then uh a is equal to

831
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,680
the whole interval. Right? So this means

832
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,680
that the that f is constant zero which

833
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,960
means that the two functions coincided

834
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,480
everywhere. Right? And so we just need

835
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:42,079
to prove that f is

836
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,480
both uh open and closed. But the zero

837
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:51,240
set if you take a continuous function

838
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:51,240
right. So if if f here is continuous

839
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,319
and you have a sequence

840
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,599
so that each element here in the

841
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:05,839
sequence is zero and these xn converts

842
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,839
to some x. Well then by continuity right

843
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:11,359
by by continuity

844
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:12,960
f of x would also be zero. This is by

845
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,680
continuity

846
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,680
right we already

847
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:24,079
so this means that this set here is

848
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:27,839
definitely closed right and the open

849
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:30,559
thing with the open is just exactly this

850
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:33,760
property that we're assuming that if you

851
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,160
have an element in it each element is

852
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,359
interior which means that there is this

853
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:43,280
little interval around it right so you

854
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,440
have we have proven that it's both uh

855
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,960
closed. We prove that first and also

856
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,920
open. And so we have that that if you

857
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,119
have two such function

858
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,720
defined both continuous and defined on

859
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,119
an interval they coincide at one point

860
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,880
and if they coincide at one point then

861
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,640
they coincide in a little neighborhood.

862
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,359
If you have two function with this

863
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,079
property then they must be equal in the

864
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,599
whole interval. Right? Okay. So now how

865
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:17,400
does this relate to the the uniqueness

866
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,400
that we wanted to prove?

867
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,240
So we're starting again. So we have the

868
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,079
so we have so this is again the picard

869
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,640
linder theorem and this is the

870
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,640
uniqueness part.

871
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,280
And so you're looking at again you're

872
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:44,200
looking at solutions

873
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,200
to to this OD.

874
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:58,160
Um and we have that now we had that um

875
00:54:53,839 --> 00:55:02,720
in a we have that in a so and then we

876
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:08,280
let sorry and let y1

877
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,280
and y2 be solutions

878
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,599
and let's say that these two they may be

879
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,520
defined on different interval of course

880
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,520
you know but but you just take the

881
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,839
intersection of the two intervals that

882
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:28,760
they're defined. So suppose that they're

883
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,760
both defined say on the same interval

884
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:38,800
like this

885
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:41,760
and this interval here and I of course

886
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:45,040
has to include the zero where we want

887
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,680
this condition.

888
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,079
Well then we have what do we have? So we

889
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,520
have a interval and we have two

890
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,880
continuous functions. They're actually

891
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,480
better than continuous. They're

892
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,720
differentiable

893
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:02,000
and even the derivative is continuous.

894
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:06,160
But but never mind that. Uh we have that

895
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,160
we have that y1 of zero is equal to a

896
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,799
and that's equal to y2 of zero. So they

897
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,160
coincide at one point.

898
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:19,040
And now the you the Picard Lindelof

899
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:23,359
theorem said that because there were two

900
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:26,240
solutions if you restrict the interval

901
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:28,960
right to looking at this little interval

902
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,599
around zero but then there was a unique

903
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,520
fixed point right so it means that in a

904
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:39,640
small neighborhood

905
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,640
of the origin so two in a small

906
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,160
neighborhood

907
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,040
of the

908
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:56,319
origin. This is again this is thanks to

909
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,319
that in the contracting mapping theorem

910
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,079
you had a unique fixed point in a small

911
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:06,240
neighborhood of the origin y1

912
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:10,720
is equal to y2 right but actually the

913
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:14,000
pical line the argument would work at

914
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:17,760
any other point right suppose you take

915
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,480
any other point then you and you take a

916
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,640
solution to the OD well if If you take

917
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:28,319
another point then the value so suppose

918
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:31,520
so so if you take so take you any other

919
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,760
point so here you have zero

920
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,799
and so now take any other points let's

921
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,599
call it x0

922
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:44,960
and if you assume that these two

923
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:47,359
functions coincide at this point so

924
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:52,079
suppose that y1

925
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:55,280
of x0 is equal to y2

926
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,040
of x0. If you now restrict this

927
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,400
interval,

928
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,359
make it sufficiently small, then the

929
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,520
argument of picard lindelof tells you

930
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,760
that you had this unique fixed point. So

931
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,640
you had a unique solution on this little

932
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,319
interval. But since they coincide at

933
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,799
this point, it means that they must be

934
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:17,680
the same in this little interval. And so

935
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:21,440
you see that now we have the condition

936
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,960
for for the lema okay for the lema that

937
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,359
said that so you have these two

938
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,920
continuous function and they were equal

939
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,000
at one point and if they're equal at a

940
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,720
point then they're equal in a whole

941
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,319
neighborhood. Okay so these two

942
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:39,520
functions these two solutions are equal

943
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:42,400
on the on the interval where they're

944
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,839
both defined. Okay.

945
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,359
Now Okay. Okay. So now you might and and

946
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,359
then I want to do a little bit of review

947
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:51,920
at the end. So at least say something

948
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,960
about the the final. But before we get

949
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,640
to that, let me just make one more

950
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,000
observation

951
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,079
about the picard line.

952
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,440
So you may

953
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,920
say that in the proof of the picard

954
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:11,119
linder we kind of had to restrict the

955
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,680
interval. Is that really necessary? Why

956
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:16,559
should we restrict? Why should we only

957
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:19,520
be able to say that we had a solution in

958
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,079
a very small interval? And so if you're

959
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,960
looking at the example, suppose you're

960
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:28,400
looking at the example

961
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,880
where y where f

962
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:37,280
so f of y

963
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:40,160
is equal to y 2 g of x is equal to zero.

964
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:45,040
And so you're looking at the OD the

965
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:47,200
solutions here y so that's uh y prime is

966
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:53,040
equal to

967
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:55,200
y 2 and uh let's say equal to a

968
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,280
uh form

969
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,960
uh x

970
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,760
uh equal to x0

971
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,440
okay so suppose you're looking at a like

972
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,839
this

973
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:13,200
right so at this x0 you want the value

974
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:17,839
of the function to be so you want sorry

975
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:20,079
y of uh x0

976
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,680
uh equal to

977
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,839
want maybe I should maybe this is a

978
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:28,880
little bit bad notation so I want a a

979
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:37,240
function so that y prime is equal to y^

980
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:37,240
2 and I want y of x0 = a Right.

981
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:45,920
Okay. Now let's say that x0

982
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:49,440
and a are both positive.

983
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:52,079
So if you're looking at this OD

984
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,520
then

985
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,520
then you can just this one here is easy

986
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,640
to solve

987
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,920
because you have a function

988
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:07,720
you have a function y prime

989
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,720
equal to y²

990
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:15,280
and now let's try to find a solution in

991
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:17,599
a neighborhood of x0 but there supposed

992
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,839
to be positive. So in a small

993
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,960
neighborhood it's positive. So I can

994
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:26,799
divide by y^2. So I can looking at so

995
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:31,599
this thing here is equivalent to that y

996
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:37,040
prime over y^ 2 is equal to 1.

997
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:41,760
And this thing here I can write as 1 / y

998
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:44,160
prime * -1. this thing here, if you're

999
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:47,040
looking at this function here by the

1000
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:49,119
chain rule, it's equal to that, right?

1001
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,920
And so this means that now you can apply

1002
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,559
the fundamental theorem of calculus. And

1003
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,599
if you're integrating this function here

1004
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:02,480
and you're integrating it from

1005
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:05,200
uh two values uh x0 to x

1006
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:12,359
uh d

1007
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:12,359
uh uh d of s sorry this is the prime.

1008
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,720
Then what you get is that this thing

1009
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:21,359
here is equal to well on one hand by the

1010
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,880
fundamental theorem of calculus it's 1 /

1011
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:27,280
y of x minus and then there's a minus

1012
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:31,760
sign sorry this here because of this

1013
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:34,799
minus sign. So it's minus this plus 1 /

1014
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,280
y of x0

1015
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:39,599
and on the other hand it's equal to this

1016
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:46,240
and when you're integrating this on this

1017
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:51,520
interval here so this also equal to x0 x

1018
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:54,160
um and then one d s this thing here is

1019
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,040
just x - x0

1020
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,640
x - x0

1021
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:03,200
okay So if you solve it then let me just

1022
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,520
write the result. If you check what this

1023
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:10,079
gives you,

1024
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:14,240
this gives you that um when you solve it

1025
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:17,520
like this, uh you're getting

1026
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:20,720
you're getting that y here is so you

1027
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,319
have this od here

1028
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,200
and you're assuming that these things

1029
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:28,640
here are positive and then the solutions

1030
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:34,720
are of the form y of x

1031
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:40,559
= a over 1 + a

1032
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:42,880
uh x0 - x right

1033
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:46,799
and so what you should observe here is

1034
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:51,319
that this thing here right as this is

1035
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:51,319
not defined. So this is note

1036
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:01,720
that y is not defined

1037
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,720
uh

1038
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:12,000
on all of r. But instead as x here goes

1039
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:16,400
to uh x0

1040
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,839
um + 1.

1041
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:23,280
As x0 goes to this, this thing here goes

1042
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:26,559
to minus one. So the denominator goes to

1043
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:30,480
zero. So the function blows up. Right?

1044
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:33,359
So this is so this here show you that it

1045
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,480
does in a neighborhood of this point. It

1046
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:39,039
has a solution but that neighborhood is

1047
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,720
not you know it's some relatively small

1048
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:46,160
neighborhoods and the function you

1049
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:48,559
cannot extend it past a you know past as

1050
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,119
a a certain value you can't extend it

1051
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:53,200
past in this case you can't extend it

1052
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,440
past this point here so to the left of

1053
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,440
this point

1054
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:03,359
to the sorry to the to the right I guess

1055
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,359
of that

1056
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,440
Okay.

1057
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,119
Okay. So now I want to say a little bit

1058
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:13,520
about the the final. Yeah. Sorry.

1059
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,920
>> Why is it that you can't um once you

1060
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,839
reach that point where it blows up does

1061
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,119
it like it never solves differential

1062
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,880
equation past that point?

1063
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,640
>> Yeah, that's right. So so the thing is

1064
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,640
so

1065
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:31,359
so right. So this here this OD is going

1066
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:34,160
to force it to once this here once Y

1067
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:36,640
become large then why become really

1068
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,920
really large so it become large too

1069
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:42,000
quickly so it becomes quickly so that so

1070
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,960
it would give you some sort of OD like

1071
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,960
this that you have some critical value

1072
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,720
where you couldn't extend it past that

1073
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:53,599
because it is it will have like a a

1074
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:57,039
tangent that is that is going vertical

1075
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:59,920
like this. Okay. And

1076
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:04,400
>> so you can't So, so this means that

1077
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:07,119
there's, you know, that's right. So, so

1078
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,440
um but so, so you have a solution that

1079
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,200
exists on some interval, but it doesn't

1080
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,920
exist past this point. So, you can't

1081
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,400
have a solution,

1082
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,319
uh, you know, on some interval larger

1083
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,920
than than this to the left. and and this

1084
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:25,039
is probably a similar phenomena on the

1085
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:27,520
other side, right?

1086
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:30,240
Okay.

1087
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,839
But and it's like a kind of standard

1088
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:36,000
prop, you know, standard uh issue that

1089
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:38,640
for uh differential equations you can

1090
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,799
get blowups like this that that this is

1091
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,799
a particular simple examp. Any other

1092
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,799
questions?

1093
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,880
Um okay, great.
