1
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,359
um okay so today uh despite my

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,439
admonition doesn't look like a very good

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,800
attendance so I'm going to give you all

4
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,199
the answers to the midterm just to

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,599
reward you for I'm I'm joking but uh I'm

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,320
glad you decided to come because it's a

7
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,800
fun lecture and it's very relevant to

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
what is going to be what we're going to

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,599
be learning really for the next few

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,440
lectures

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,079
which is thinking about models of

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,920
oligopoly once again an awesome

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,600
word which is really just a description

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,399
of what most markets in America are so

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,399
we've covered two extremes we've covered

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,399
one extreme for markets which is perfect

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,399
competition doesn't really exist we've

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
covered another extreme which is

19
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,280
Monopoly which is which does exist but

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,920
it's still fairly rare the more common

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,719
form of markets is what we call

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,040
oligopoly which is when there's a small

23
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:08,320
number of firms competing to provide the

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,680
good so it's more than one firm so it's

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,600
more than Monopoly but it's less than

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
free entry it's less than a large number

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,000
of firms driving profits to zero so

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,759
let's see about the prototypical example

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,920
of oligopolistic Industry the Auto

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,400
industry most cars in America are sold

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,759
by fewer than 20

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,600
companies but they're sold by well more

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,280
than than one so if you drive on the

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,240
road you see cars from you know

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,479
primarily 10 but maybe even up to 20

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,759
different car

37
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,159
companies so is that enough to drive us

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,520
the perfectly competitive outcome that

39
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,399
is those 10 to 20 car companies enough

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,799
to drive us to zero

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,520
profits probably not but is that enough

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,799
that each company can simply set its

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,880
price and pick its point on the demand

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,320
curve probably not either so we're

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,759
somewhere in between we're in an

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,439
oligopolistic market now an

47
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,280
oligopolistic Market firms can behave

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,720
two ways they can behave cooperatively

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
or non-cooperatively

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,440
okay when there's one firm there's no

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,879
issue just yourself when there's

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,440
thousands of firms you can't figure out

53
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,280
how to how to how to uh get together but

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,120
when you have a small number of firms

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,319
you can imagine behaving cooperatively

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,440
non-cooperatively cooperatively would be

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:32,000
to form a cartel so if you want to

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,160
cooperate you form what's called a

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,400
cartel which is a Cooperative

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,599
organization of otherwise competing

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,959
firms the classic example of this is

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,280
OPEC the organization of petroleum

63
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,800
exporting

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,680
countries this organization formed in

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,480
1970s of the Middle Eastern countries

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,280
that responsible for about two-thirds of

67
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,920
the world world's oil they got together

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,959
and said let's produce

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,599
cooperatively and we'll decide how much

70
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,040
to produce and what price to set as if

71
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,959
we were were sort of a collective

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,599
Monopoly so in other words the idea of

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,720
calization is you effectively turn

74
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,159
yourself into a shared Monopoly with all

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,480
the benefits we've talked about in terms

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,319
of profits and

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,920
things okay so basically the idea is

78
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,720
look what do monopolies do they don't

79
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,440
they get rid of competition they sort of

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,519
maximize profits given the elasticity

81
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,319
demand they face when you for a cartel

82
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,120
you essentially say look let's do that

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,840
let's get rid of competition let's just

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,280
create a as big a piie as possible we'll

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,319
figure out some way to split

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,319
it okay now of course the Other Extreme

87
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,840
is a

88
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,519
non-cooperative oligopolistic market

89
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,959
where firms don't get together and

90
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:43,599
compete where firms where firms I'm

91
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,159
sorry don't get together and agree um uh

92
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,280
on what to do and in fact that's more

93
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,280
realistic and we'll talk about reasons

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,319
why next lecture next lecture we'll talk

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
about how cartels work and why they

96
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,280
don't typically

97
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,400
last so today we'll focus on the more

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,400
realistic case of a nonco

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Cooperative

100
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,079
oligopoly which is when there's a small

101
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,159
number of firms in an industry and they

102
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,360
can't get together and and cooperate

103
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,319
which makes sense I these are firms

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,519
which grew up hating each other sort of

105
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,400
makes sense it be hard to cooperate

106
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,360
we'll talk about next time why that

107
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,080
is so what do we

108
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,040
do in that case well in that case things

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
get

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,280
hard the reason we start with perfect

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,400
competition Monopoly is because they're

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,759
relatively easy to think about oligopoly

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,479
it gets super complicated and we have to

114
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,479
turn to a new tool the tool of gain

115
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,240
Theory

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,720
okay um basically the idea of game

117
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,039
theory is to think of these firms

118
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,720
interacting as if they're playing a

119
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,240
game think of there's there's n firms in

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
a market where n is

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,520
small they're they're sort of playing a

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,160
game against each

123
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,320
other and so there's two key pieces of

124
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,800
Game Theory to keep track of think about

125
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,919
playing a game what are sort of two

126
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,840
things you want to figure out the first

127
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,360
thing is your

128
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,440
strategy what is the right strategy to

129
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,560
win this

130
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,520
game the second point you want to figure

131
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,600
out is

132
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,280
equilibrium when is the game over when

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,120
does the game settle into an answer that

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,319
all parties agree on with Monopoly

135
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,479
there's a set of rules once everybody

136
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,560
else is bankrupt you win that's the

137
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,400
equilibrium okay so basically any game

138
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,039
has a strategy and an equilibrium

139
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,400
rule it turns

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,400
out defining equilibrium in a rule with

141
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,240
in a game with explicit rules is easy

142
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,880
defining in a game where firms are just

143
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,520
competing in this blood in a potentially

144
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,400
bloodthirsty manner is not so easy and

145
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,919
it turns out there is an enormous field

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,960
in economics all about how do you think

147
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,560
about equilibrium in game theoretic

148
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,360
markets how do you think about when

149
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,800
things finally settle down and end up

150
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,800
and the most famous of these ideas of

151
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,520
how to find equilibrium is what we call

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,080
the Nash equilibrium any you guys ever

153
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,680
see or read a beautiful

154
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,800
mind that movie a little bit raise your

155
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,360
hands yeah okay so a bunch of you saw it

156
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,360
so it's about John Nash fascinating

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
character um he was a mathematician

158
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,960
brilliant

159
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,520
mathematician uh who whose fundamental

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,240
insight and if you see the movie this is

161
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,680
so Illustrated well in a bar with the

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
group of men are trying to pick up a

163
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,160
group of women and again with this

164
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,840
fundamental Insight that competition can

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
be bad now if you think about economics

166
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,120
we've learned everything we learn about

167
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,319
competition is good competition is good

168
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,599
it delivers better outcomes for

169
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,000
consumers it reduces deadweight loss but

170
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,880
he he actually came up with a theory

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,440
that where actually in certain

172
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,840
situations competition can be bad and

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,759
cooperation can be better and that was

174
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,520
sort of his fundamental insight

175
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,879
okay and then he went insane

176
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,199
unfortunately as can sometimes happen

177
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,360
and the movie is sort of all about that

178
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,000
it's very interesting it's a very

179
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,520
interesting movie well acted interesting

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,879
story about this poor guy who uh had

181
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,919
these B insights and then and then

182
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,000
developed mental illness severe

183
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:23,800
schizophrenia um so what John Nash

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,360
defined is the Nash equilibrium and the

185
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,560
Nash equilibrium is defined as follows

186
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,360
precisely a Nash equilibrium is the

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,160
equilibrium where no player wants to

188
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,319
change their

189
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,280
strategy given all the other players

190
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,479
strategies so you're an equilibrium

191
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,400
where no player wants to change their

192
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,080
strategy given all the other player

193
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,080
strategies that is a Nash equilibrium

194
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,879
that is formally if you hold all other

195
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,680
players Behavior

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,800
constant I can't do any better when I've

197
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,199
reached that point I'm in equilibrium we

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,639
reach to a point where I can't do any

199
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,520
better holding everybody's strategies

200
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,960
constant than I'm an equilibrium and the

201
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,159
best example of this is example some of

202
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,280
you may have heard about and you've

203
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,960
certainly seen in movies the example the

204
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,000
prisoners dilemma okay the prisoners

205
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,000
dilemma is a famous movie device but

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,560
almost a f example which is two guys are

207
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,720
arrested for a crime it's not airtight

208
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,039
that they did it they think the two guys

209
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,560
did it but they really to really make it

210
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:33,000
airtight

211
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,399
they'd need them to admit it so let's

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,560
say in this example and we'll give you

213
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,240
examples like this and you'll need to

214
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,159
think out interpret them so the example

215
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,839
is two guys get arrested right now today

216
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,839
there is enough evidence to send each of

217
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,720
them to jail for one

218
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:53,279
year okay enough just one year but if

219
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,720
one guy squeals and says no the other

220
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,800
guy did it if he turned States evidence

221
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,720
whove learned a lot about this in the

222
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,000
FBF trial and the upcoming Trump's trial

223
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,800
okay the idea is if one person turn

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,839
States evidence or squeals then they get

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,959
zero they walk away and the other guy

226
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,839
gets five

227
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,800
years okay now if they both squeal they

228
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,880
both get five years okay so basic the

229
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,640
situation is if nothing happens they

230
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,720
each get one year if either tells on the

231
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,440
other person then the person they told

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,560
on gets five years so what the way we

233
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,959
analyze game theoretic situations like

234
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,000
this is we write down we call a payoff

235
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,560
Matrix so write down a payoff Matrix so

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,640
the payoff Matrix look as follow you got

237
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,279
prisoner

238
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,279
a on the Y AIS here and prisoner

239
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,279
B on the x- axis okay and you've got

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,079
four

241
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,480
situations okay in one case let's say

242
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,320
prisoner

243
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,560
a is

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,760
silent he doesn't talk

245
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,680
and prisoner B also stays silent they

246
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:10,440
don't talk then in that case a gets one

247
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,440
year and B gets one

248
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:18,519
year now let's say that prisoner a stays

249
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,519
silent but prisoner B talks prisoner B

250
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,160
squeals then prisoner a now gets five

251
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,160
years and prisoner b gets

252
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,440
zero over here we have what if prisoner

253
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,760
a talks well if prisoner a talks and

254
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,079
prisoner B remains silent then prisoner

255
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:43,440
a gets zero and prisoner b gets

256
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,440
five but if they both talk they both get

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,880
five okay questions about how I set up

258
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,880
that Matrix given the words given the

259
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,959
description of the problem you're going

260
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
need to be able to take these descript

261
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,800
set of matrices like this so any

262
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,959
questions about how I did that

263
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,680
okay now what we want to ask is what

264
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:09,600
should each player do and the the sort

265
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,480
of cheat in National equilibrium games

266
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,800
the first step is to say look the

267
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,800
easiest case would be if there is a

268
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
dominant

269
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,160
strategy if there's a dominant strategy

270
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:32,279
is there one strategy which no matter

271
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,839
what the other guy does you want to do

272
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,279
then that's the Nash equilibrium right

273
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,720
that's that's the outcome that you're

274
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,040
going to do if there a strategy that's

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,279
dominant that's the strategy you're

276
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,279
going to

277
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,440
play okay the best thing to do no matter

278
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,720
what the other person

279
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,519
does okay now if they could agree to

280
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,440
cooperate if the two of them got

281
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,399
together in a room beforehand and they

282
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,240
trusted each other they could Rec

283
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,079
cooperate then clearly what is the

284
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,639
dominant coop operative

285
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,240
strategy yeah they both stay silent they

286
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
both get a

287
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,320
year but let's say they can't do that

288
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,839
they can't get in room together they

289
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,079
never put in room together in the movies

290
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,199
right they keep them separate and

291
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,279
they're scummy criminals they don't

292
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:20,000
trust each other okay so basically what

293
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,279
happens now if you're prisoner a and

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,440
you're not sure what prisoner B is going

295
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,800
to

296
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,800
do what should you do if you think

297
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,040
prisoner B is going to stay

298
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,000
silent yeah

299
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,360
talk because your

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,440
payoff is better what should you do if

301
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,800
you think prisoner B is going to

302
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,680
talk yeah talk because your payoff if

303
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,240
you think prisoner B is going to talk

304
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,519
then you should

305
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,680
talk okay so I'm sorry I wrote I wrote

306
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,160
this uh did I do this right yep I did

307
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,040
this wrong that's what I did wrong it's

308
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,320
no better if they both talk I say they

309
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,600
both get three that makes more sense I

310
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,560
set the example up wrong if they both

311
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,880
talk they both get three that makes your

312
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,440
answer is still right but this makes it

313
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,680
non-binding that that involves

314
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,000
inequality this is this is non-binding

315
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,839
so clearly prisoner

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,360
a is better off talking no matter what

317
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,440
prisoner B is going to do what about

318
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,120
prisoner B what's their dominant

319
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,680
strategy yeah same thing it's a

320
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,120
symmetric problem these problems won't

321
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,600
always be symmetric but it's a hell of a

322
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,920
lot easier when they are so you only

323
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
have to solve for one person you assume

324
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,519
the other other person does the same

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,519
thing so prisoner B's dominant strategy

326
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,920
is to talk so we have a situation where

327
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,959
both dominant strategies align therefore

328
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,079
we have an

329
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,600
equilibrium and that equilibrium is what

330
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,839
it's they both

331
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,680
talk and they both get three

332
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,320
years here's what's fascinating they are

333
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,360
worse off than if they both stayed

334
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,240
silent competition has yielded a worse

335
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,440
outcome we haven't seen that before in

336
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,480
this class

337
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,800
competition in the sense of trying to do

338
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,560
what's best for you at the expense of

339
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,000
the other guy has yielded the worse

340
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,040
outcome than

341
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,360
cooperation that's what's incredibly

342
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,519
Innovative about that's what Nash Nash

343
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,440
even though being a mathematician won

344
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,240
the Nobel prize in economics in Game

345
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,880
Theory went from something which was

346
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,160
kind of relatively new when I was a grad

347
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,079
student in the late 80s to now being a

348
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,680
quarter of the

349
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,079
introductory uh training that graduate

350
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,320
students PhD students in economics get

351
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,680
game theory has become a dominant so to

352
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,880
speak uh element of all economics

353
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,759
training because it provides such a

354
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,720
valuable tool for thinking about this so

355
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,440
basically you end up with What's called

356
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,920
the prisoners

357
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,480
dilemma which is prisoners are each

358
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,399
better off by ratting on the other and

359
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,759
it ends up they both end up worse off

360
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,800
and this also shows us how to solve a

361
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,199
nash game a game with a Nash equilibrium

362
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
which is you look for each player's

363
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,240
dominant strategy

364
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,600
and you find the point where they

365
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,519
align the point where the two dominant

366
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,720
strategies align is by definition an as

367
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,880
equilibrium why because they're both

368
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,040
doing the best they can giveing the

369
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,480
other person now if the two dominant

370
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,399
strategies don't align there may not be

371
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,880
an

372
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,279
equilibrium you have situations where

373
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,959
A's dominant strategy different than B's

374
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,360
Domin strategy they don't align then you

375
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,759
might not get an equilibrium but in this

376
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,519
case they align and most cases will give

377
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,399
you they align so you get a Nash

378
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,800
equilibrium where they both

379
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,959
align okay

380
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,480
now this is all cute and stuff but like

381
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,399
this is a class about economics not

382
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,839
about

383
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,880
crime but it turns out the same logic

384
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,639
applies to playing economic games so

385
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,079
imagine let's take the market for soda

386
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,360
and imagine there's two big players

387
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,040
Pepsi and

388
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,959
Coke and let's imagine there's a $16

389
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,959
billion soda

390
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,600
Market let's further imagine that absent

391
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,880
any advertising they would split it that

392
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
with no advertising C and Pepsi would

393
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,240
each get 8 billion

394
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,720
out of the

395
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,759
market

396
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,759
but they can

397
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,160
advertise adverti advertising costs five

398
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,440
billion so if they advertise they only

399
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,360
take home three billion

400
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,920
net however if they advertise they drive

401
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,440
the other guy out of the

402
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,480
market so the choices don't advertise

403
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,519
and split the market advertise in which

404
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,720
case um if you um

405
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,519
in which case if you advertise and you

406
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,519
win the other guy's

407
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,240
gone okay and you get you get the whole

408
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,759
Market but if you don't advertise and

409
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,920
you don't win and the other guy

410
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,839
advertises you're gone so what that

411
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,759
payoff Matrix look like well let's write

412
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,560
that

413
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
down you've

414
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,199
got

415
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,199
Coke and

416
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,319
Pepsi Coke and Pepsi Coke can not

417
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:08,120
advertise or

418
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:10,600
advertise okay Pepsi cannot advertise or

419
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,120
advertise if Coke and Pepsi both don't

420
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,120
advertise they each get

421
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,559
eight if Coke doesn't advertise and

422
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,400
Pepsi does coke ends up with zero and

423
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,520
Pepsi ends up with 11 which is the 16 is

424
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,039
wrong in the notes by the way Andrew we

425
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:34,480
should fix this um which is the 16 uh

426
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,600
that they um the 16 that they got from

427
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
having the market minus the five they

428
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,480
spent in

429
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,760
advertising on the other if Koke

430
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,799
advertised and Pepsi doesn't then Koch

431
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,880
gets 11 and Pepsi gets

432
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:50,320
zero and if they both advertise Coke

433
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,520
gets three and Pepsi gets

434
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,480
three so once again the dominant

435
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,360
cooperative strategy is they both don't

436
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,600
advertise but the dominant

437
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,960
non-cooperative strategy in each case is

438
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,039
to advertise Koke is always better off

439
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,400
if it

440
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,120
advertises than if it doesn't Pepsi's

441
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,039
always better off it advertises than it

442
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,200
doesn't so they'll both advertise and

443
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,159
you'll end up with both parties being

444
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,200
worse off they just agreed not to

445
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,679
advertise this is not an irrelevant

446
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,679
example until about I don't know it's

447
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,400
got to be about 10 years ago hard liquor

448
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,200
you know whiskey vodka things like that

449
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,159
never adverti on

450
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,880
television now as a kid I thought that

451
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,559
was a law but it turns out it wasn't it

452
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
wasn't a law it was a Cooperative

453
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,640
agreement among the manufacturer of hard

454
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,600
liquor not to advertise on television

455
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,320
they literally had reached the

456
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,880
Cooperative equilibrium and then it

457
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,000
broke down and now you see the ads on TV

458
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,600
I don't know what be interesting I don't

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,840
know what caused the broke down actually

460
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,679
Andrew let's make a note I should do a

461
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,640
case study on should add that that'd be

462
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,280
good to add be be interesting to think

463
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,799
about what caused that but they used to

464
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,200
cooperate and they don't okay so B

465
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,799
basically this an example of how the

466
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,480
prisoner's dilemma can lead to a worse

467
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,480
outcome questions about

468
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:14,280
that okay this doesn't just

469
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:17,000
apply to Coke and Pepsi or prisoners

470
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,200
think about Andrew here let's say Andrew

471
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,840
is in a new relationship still try to

472
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,159
feel out the his partner okay and they

473
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,799
have a

474
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:30,679
fight and Andrew is thinking two things

475
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,600
can happen I can go apolog oliz and I

476
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,000
can go eat crow and say it's my fault

477
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,240
let's say they're both at fault Andrew

478
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,360
can say I can go eat crow and say it's

479
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,080
my fault but then if my partners say

480
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,320
it's their fault I'm GNA feel like

481
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,919
 the partner's thinking the same

482
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,200
thing they' both be better off if they

483
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
just apologize because they're both at

484
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,919
fault but they both don't apologize

485
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
because they don't want to look like the

486
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,679
loser and they break

487
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,880
up okay prison is a lemon action in

488
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,000
personal

489
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,360
relationships okay basically it's hard

490
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,480
to form Cooperative relationships

491
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,760
and non-cooperative equilibria can lead

492
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,960
to bad

493
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:11,760
outcomes okay now this is the very very

494
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,679
tip of the incredibly exciting field of

495
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,840
Game Theory Game Theory is a wonderful

496
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,640
exciting field we have a great course

497
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
called

498
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,200
1412 which is Game Theory which takes

499
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,960
this little bit as its first lecture and

500
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,880
from there develops a whole semester of

501
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,440
Game Theory you might say well how you

502
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,360
do a whole semester well let me give you

503
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,760
one

504
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,320
example let me give you one example of

505
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,120
how you can solve

506
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:35,120
the prisoners dilemma without explicit

507
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,960
cooperation how do you solve pris

508
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,320
without explicit cooperation you can do

509
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,320
it through playing a repeated

510
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,679
game a repeated game so imagine the

511
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,080
following imagine Coke and Pepsi play

512
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,039
this game every year these is annual

513
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,440
numbers play this game every year

514
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,400
forever they play this game every year

515
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,799
forever okay now imagine Coke says the

516
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,320
following to Pepsi it's not it's not a

517
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,360
cooperation it's it's a threat coch says

518
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,520
to Pepsi I will not advertise as long as

519
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,320
you don't

520
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,720
advertise but the minute you advertise I

521
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,320
will advertise

522
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,480
forever so coke says to Pepsi I they

523
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,799
start with no advertising Koke says I

524
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,880
won't advertise you don't advertise but

525
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,279
the minute you advertise I'll advertise

526
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,679
forever now think about Pepsi's decision

527
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:28,120
if Pepsi advertises in Period

528
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,960
one in Period one they get the whole

529
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,279
Market because kooch is committed to not

530
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,400
advertise they get

531
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,000
11 they get

532
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,039
11 and then kooch says screw your

533
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,960
advertising forever they get three plus

534
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,960
three plus three plus dot do dot do

535
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,960
dot what if Pepsi doesn't

536
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,360
advertise then they get eight

537
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,320
forever you don't to be a math genius to

538
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,159
see this is a bigger

539
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,320
number so it changes Pepsi's dominant

540
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,679
strategy

541
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,760
Koch simply issuing that threat changes

542
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,600
the Domin strategy no cooperation here

543
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,960
simply a threat and yet it enforces the

544
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,039
Cooperative

545
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,080
equilibrium but that doesn't work unless

546
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,720
the game is

547
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,039
infinite imagine that we know 100 years

548
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,880
from now the US will ban soda and Coke

549
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,679
and Pepsi know that they know at some

550
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,520
point this game will end so do Market's

551
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,919
going to go

552
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,880
away what is Pepsi's optimal strategy in

553
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,880
the 99th

554
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,880
year yeah because last year it's the

555
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,919
last year Coke can't punish him it's

556
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,520
over but kooch knows that so what's

557
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,480
Coke's optimal strategy in the 998th

558
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,760
year advertise because I know Pepsi's

559
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,640
can advertise in the 99th year they

560
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,240
might as well get ahead of the game and

561
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,600
advertise 998th year you can work

562
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,360
backwards to see the game

563
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,360
collapses from year one no will

564
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,840
play because they know working backwards

565
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,919
that as soon as someone commits not to

566
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,360
advertise they're going to advertise and

567
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,720
then just going to advertise

568
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,559
forever so here's a solution that works

569
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,640
but only under particular conditions

570
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,960
which is an infinite repeated

571
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,480
game that's pretty

572
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,679
cool okay and that is once again the

573
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,720
kind of things you could think about

574
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,039
with the tools of Game Theory what 1412

575
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,799
does is show you how to mathematically

576
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,640
to prove these things how think about

577
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,960
all the cool games it depends on who has

578
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,960
what information who has what bargaining

579
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,039
strength there's all sorts of cool stuff

580
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,039
that comes into play here

581
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,120
yeah don't know it's not but you don't

582
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,120
know that

583
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,400
stop you know I I think I think that's

584
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,200
my I should have saved my whiskey

585
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,240
example for this which is

586
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,640
somehow the whiskey companies had

587
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,039
decided they were playing this repeated

588
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,480
equilibrium this this repeated game and

589
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,480
somehow it broke down now I don't know

590
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,440
what broke did they suddenly think G

591
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,159
people losing their taste for hard

592
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,080
liquor we better get you know get get it

593
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,120
while it's good I don't know it's a good

594
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,679
question but in reality sometimes it

595
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,559
works sometimes it doesn't and that's

596
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
what is exciting about game theory is to

597
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:12,559
think about deriving the conditions

598
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,440
under which it's likely to work and not

599
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:20,720
likely to work good question other

600
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:24,840
questions so that's game theory in a in

601
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:28,159
a big uh sort of in a in in in in a

602
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,120
nutshell okay what we're going to do now

603
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,960
is move from this vague concept of Game

604
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,039
Theory to a particular model a

605
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,240
particular game theoretic model and

606
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,039
that's the model we'll focus on in this

607
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,000
class as the model of non-cooperative

608
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:45,159
oligopoly but I'm going to tell you it's

609
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,240
one model of an enormous class of models

610
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,480
it's just a models particularly

611
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,320
convenient to work with and it gives the

612
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,960
intuition without the math being too

613
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,039
hard okay so we're going to move to one

614
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,559
particular model but recognize the model

615
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:59,399
we're using is one of a class of models

616
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,399
one could use to model non Cooperative

617
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:04,039
oligopolistic equilibria that may be the

618
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:05,760
most complicated three words I'll use

619
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,520
together in this class non-cooperative

620
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,600
oligopolistic equilibria okay so we're

621
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,399
going to talk

622
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,399
about the Corno

623
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,880
model of non-cooperative equilibria this

624
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,360
is basically a version of the Nash

625
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,760
model okay so what we're going to do is

626
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,679
we're going to take the general Nash

627
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,080
model and we're going to enrich it

628
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,919
saying beyond having two choices you

629
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,440
have a whole schedule of choices your

630
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,200
choice isn't just a versus B but there's

631
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,640
a large set of choices you can make

632
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,600
which is true in economic context

633
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,200
usually not a versus B there's how much

634
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,919
you're going to advertise Etc there's

635
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
whole set of choices you can make and

636
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,799
but we're still going to consider two

637
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,600
firms playing because it gets really

638
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,880
messy Beyond two firms although once

639
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,760
they get 142 I'll teach you how to

640
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,520
handle that so let's imagine the world

641
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,840
of

642
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,799
flights from New York to

643
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,520
Chicago okay and let's imagine due to

644
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,600
the hub and spoke problem we discussed

645
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,720
last time there's only two firms that

646
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,480
fly New York to Chicago United and

647
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,440
American obviously there's more than

648
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,080
that but just to make this example easy

649
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,520
imagine only two firms that fly to these

650
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,760
two firms do dominate the market to

651
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,200
Chicago 90% of flight to Chicago one or

652
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,559
the other of those so let's say that

653
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,760
that these two firms the only firms in

654
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,000
the

655
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,919
market and now we want to ask how does

656
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,559
each firm KN the other firms out there

657
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,520
how does each firm decide on what price

658
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:38,320
to set and how many flights to run to do

659
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,799
that we are going to set up the Coro

660
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,000
model and the Coro model is going to say

661
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,399
we're going to look for the Nash

662
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
equilibrium but in terms of set of

663
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:47,200
phrasing in a vague term like dominant

664
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,559
strategy will phrase the Nash

665
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,600
equilibrium as follows this is a long

666
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,960
sentence so bear with me the keno

667
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:59,679
equilibrium is the set of

668
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:03,679
quantities for each firm so such that

669
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,679
holding other firms quantities

670
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,200
constant no firm can obtain a higher a

671
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,480
higher profit by deviating say it again

672
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,320
the set of quantities for each firm such

673
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,919
that holding every other firm's quantity

674
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,039
constant no firm can raise their profits

675
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,640
by

676
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:29,360
deviating so it's a schedule a set of

677
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,840
quantities a schedule of quantities that

678
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,760
sort of maps out your dominant strategy

679
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,200
it's not like there's one dominant

680
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,080
strategy there a dominant schedule of

681
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,880
strategies to see that let's go to

682
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,760
figure 131 this is an example of the

683
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,440
kind of figure you're going to become

684
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:47,320
familiar with over the next few

685
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,480
lectures figure 131 shows the market for

686
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,760
American Airlines as if it was a

687
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,760
monopoly imagine American downside a

688
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,880
monopoly and imagine we're going to

689
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,799
write down arbitrarily that the demand

690
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,360
curve for flights to Chicago

691
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,480
is 339 minus Q where Q is the total

692
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,039
number of flights that's the demand

693
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,039
curve for flights to Chicago just arbitr

694
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:09,240
written

695
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,480
down and let's say further that

696
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,200
arbitrarily that marginal cost equals

697
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,320
$147 so it's 339 minus Q's demand

698
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,200
marginal cost

699
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,760
147 so what would a monopolis do well

700
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,640
good practice for yall for tomorrow

701
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,519
night what would a monopolis do

702
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,640
monopolis would set marginal revenue to

703
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,760
marginal cost well what's revenue

704
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:37,720
revenue is

705
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:41,720
339 Q - Q ^2 what's marginal revenue 339

706
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:46,720
minus 2 Q so monopolis sets marginal

707
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,799
revenue 339 - 2q equal to marginal cost

708
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,640
which is

709
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,279
147 and you get that the alha Monopoly

710
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,399
quantity

711
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:00,519
qm is 90 is

712
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:05,159
um qm is 96

713
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,159
flights and the optimal price is

714
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,200
$243 we get the optimal quantity by

715
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,679
solving this equation get the opal chice

716
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,360
by plugging that back in the demand

717
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,159
equation so if this is a monopoly this

718
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,760
is what they're going to do note of

719
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,120
course that price is well above marginal

720
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,279
cost because it's a monopoly there's a

721
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,399
markup okay so that's what they would

722
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:33,039
and we could see that in figure 131 by

723
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,080
drawing the monopolis problem you see

724
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,279
the marginal cost is at

725
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,399
147 you see the the main curve is the

726
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,200
Blue

727
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,480
Line the marginal revenue curve is the

728
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,360
red downward sloping line the maroon

729
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,360
line the darker red line we find the

730
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,519
point where marginal revenue intersects

731
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,519
marginal cost which is at 96 flights

732
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,600
96,000

733
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,840
whatever and then to find the price we

734
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,840
read it off the demand curve which is

735
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,399
the 96 flights the price is 243 and

736
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,519
that's the Monopoly

737
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:09,720
outcome okay questions about

738
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:12,360
that now imagine and this is a weird

739
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,640
weird case but just imagine for a minute

740
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,240
somehow through the indust through

741
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,440
industrial Espionage America knew that

742
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,519
United imagine how United is in the

743
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,159
market it's no longer Monopoly and

744
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,640
imagine americ knows United's going to

745
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,559
fly 64

746
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,039
flights 64,000 is Thousands but doesn't

747
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,200
matter Dr the unit I don't know somehow

748
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:36,080
it knows they're going to do

749
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:39,760
64 well what should American do given

750
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,320
the knowledge that United's can do 64

751
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,799
flights well what it should do is it

752
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,679
should compute its residual

753
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:51,120
demand what's its residual demand it's

754
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,880
the demand that's left over after United

755
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,600
does the 64 flights so what's its

756
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,320
residual demand well it's its residual

757
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,320
demand is 339

758
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,919
minus what it's going to fly now it's

759
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,159
little Q because there's two firms in

760
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,799
the

761
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,279
market minus the 64 flights that

762
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,840
America's going to

763
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:18,679
provide so its residual demand is

764
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,679
275 minus Q

765
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:26,120
Suba Q sub I'm sorry Q sub two yeah q75

766
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,760
minus Q Suba that's its residual demand

767
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,480
well arm with that residual demand we

768
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,919
can go back and redo the Monopoly

769
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,679
example so look at figure

770
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:39,919
132 americ is originally the outer Blue

771
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,360
Line D the fact that United is flying 64

772
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,120
flights shifts it to the inner demand

773
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,519
curve the residual demand curve D

774
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,880
Prime but from there the magic is the

775
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:54,240
same we compute marginal revenue which

776
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,080
is Mr Prime we find where marginal

777
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,360
revenue equals marginal

778
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,559
cost okay so what what's marginal

779
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,919
revenue marginal revenue here is going

780
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:07,399
to be 275 minus 2 QA that's the marginal

781
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,559
revenue I just multiplied that by q and

782
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:12,000
then took the

783
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:16,559
derivative marginal cost is

784
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,360
147 so the new optimal Q subet is

785
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,559
instead of 96 they're going to fly 64

786
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,320
flights so the new optimal Q sub a

787
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,639
remember now Q sub is the old big Q

788
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,159
because there's now two firms not one

789
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:35,320
firm the new optimal Q sub is 64 flights

790
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:37,960
and the optimal price is

791
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,679
211 the price has come

792
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,559
down

793
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,960
why because now part of the Market's

794
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,919
been taken so if they want to sell at

795
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,200
this Market they've got to have a lower

796
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,480
price so you get the new equilibrium

797
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,279
which is where the maroon line the MRP

798
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:58,360
Prime hits the red line the

799
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:00,360
MC that's a 64 flights and a price you

800
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,919
read off the man curve of

801
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,919
21 questions about

802
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,919
that

803
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,639
yeah no it the question is doesn't

804
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:14,399
matter what price they're setting

805
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:16,360
actually it doesn't because all you

806
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,679
because your curve here is just depend

807
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,799
on how many flights they're going to

808
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,559
sell now in reality it would but in

809
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,559
practice it doesn't because we're

810
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,399
assuming that this we're basically as

811
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,679
long long as we know the other firm's

812
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:32,840
conditions in particular if we know

813
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,679
their marginal costs and things we're

814
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,559
good here we are going to assume that

815
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,039
the marginal cost of American equals the

816
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,240
marginal cost of United and that makes

817
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:46,159
the problem easier in

818
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,360
reality you would you know in in reality

819
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,600
it'd be more complicated but as long as

820
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,240
we assume the marginal cost the same I

821
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,039
don't need to know what they're going to

822
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,880
set the price at I know what they're

823
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,519
going to set the price at because

824
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,240
they're like me it makes the problem

825
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,120
symmetric the marginal costs are

826
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,320
different it's not symmetric it's more

827
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:04,159
complicated okay good question

828
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,159
okay so basically in

829
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,720
general in general of course American

830
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,879
doesn't know how many flights United is

831
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,599
going to fly so what American does is it

832
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:19,440
asks for every quantity that United

833
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,839
might fly how many do I want to fly it

834
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,520
creates what we call its best response

835
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:28,919
curve and that you can see as the Blue

836
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,079
Line in figure

837
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:34,800
133 figure 133 is the best response

838
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,079
curve we know two points on this curve

839
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,520
we know if you so what is this what let

840
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,399
me back up what is this graph this graph

841
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,159
has American this isn't price this isn't

842
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:47,760
demand graph anymore this has the

843
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,079
American quantity on the x axis and the

844
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,720
United quantity on the y- axis so we're

845
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,440
no longer doing a demand curve this is

846
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,119
now a best response

847
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,640
curve we know already I've already told

848
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:02,520
you two points on this Blue Line I've

849
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,040
told you that if United flies zero

850
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,599
America flies 96 that's the x intercept

851
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,400
of the Blue

852
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:14,240
Line I've also told you that if United

853
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,960
flies 64 American flyes 64 that's the

854
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,480
6464 Point all this line is technically

855
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,359
he going through this exercise over and

856
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,960
over again for every possible qu

857
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,359
quantity United could

858
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,720
fly so this this exercise saying for

859
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,400
every possible Quant United could fly

860
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,440
what is my best response in other words

861
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,760
if

862
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,640
United is going to fly

863
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,640
192 passengers in a quarter I should fly

864
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,280
none now this problem is

865
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,440
symmetric so United's best response

866
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,200
curve is just the flip of American's

867
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,680
best response curve they have the same

868
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,240
cost structure marginal cost is the same

869
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,079
and they face the same market conditions

870
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,640
they're in the same demand market so

871
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,760
it's a symmetric problem

872
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,800
so United's best response curve is the

873
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,440
flip if American flies

874
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,920
nothing United should fly 96 which is

875
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,040
the Y intercept of the red

876
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,119
line if American flies 64 United should

877
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,760
fly 64 and if America flies 192 United

878
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,760
stat should fly

879
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:26,079
nothing these are the graphical

880
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,680
illustration of each firm's dominant

881
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,760
strategy

882
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:36,000
their cor no strategy remember is asking

883
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,160
what's the best thing I want to do given

884
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,839
what the other person's doing well I

885
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,880
told you what the person's doing so the

886
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,160
dominant strategy for American is to

887
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,960
plug in every possible thing United

888
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,480
could

889
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,640
do and then ask what's the best thing

890
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,200
for me to

891
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,760
do United does the same thing they plug

892
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,520
in every possible thing American could

893
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,240
do and ask what's the best thing for me

894
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,560
to do if those two curves intersect

895
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,359
we have

896
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,040
equilibrium the Koo equilibrium here is

897
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:07,680
at the point

898
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:11,640
6464 why because that is the one

899
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,560
point where given what United's doing

900
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,839
American doesn't want to change its

901
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,880
strategy and given what Americans doing

902
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,800
United doesn't want to change his

903
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,720
strategy

904
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,359
yeah what's that what

905
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,920
there's uh once again that's why you

906
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,000
take 1412 there's all sorts of fun

907
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,200
things what if there's two intersections

908
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,359
what if there's no inter intersection

909
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,079
all sorts of fun examples take 1412

910
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,280
we'll go through all of them we only

911
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,480
have a couple lectures for Game Theory

912
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,160
here so I can't go through all those but

913
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,400
it gets complicated let me just say that

914
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,000
you basically it's called a multiple

915
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,160
equilibria and it basically then where

916
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,119
you start determines where you finish in

917
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,839
this model doesn't matter where you

918
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,119
start there's one equilibria that's

919
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:50,000
robust okay but um uh in a multiple

920
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,240
equilibria uh where you start could

921
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,119
could determine where you finish so in

922
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,560
my example with Andrew okay in a single

923
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,200
equilibrium model it doesn't matter sort

924
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,480
of who started the fight okay but the

925
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,760
multile model you might have very

926
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,160
different outcomes based on who started

927
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,880
the

928
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,680
fight okay so basically that

929
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,119
is the

930
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,280
intersection okay and you can't be

931
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,359
here's the key

932
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,440
Point American can't be can't say look

933
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,760
gee but my profit I I I I liked it much

934
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,160
better when I was doing this like I had

935
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,800
96 lights at a higher price

936
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,079
okay so I like that much better why

937
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,000
can't I just do that well they can't

938
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,400
because American because America won't

939
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,319
let them or americ can't because United

940
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,720
won't let them they have to account for

941
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:38,760
the other firm's response and that's

942
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,400
what's cool about oligopoly that's why

943
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,680
the game theory because you have to

944
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,680
account for the other firm's response

945
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,480
okay that's the graphics let's go

946
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:50,160
through the math okay let's do the Coro

947
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,119
math to show you how this works

948
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,119
mathematically

949
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:55,119
yeah

950
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,599
begin well that that's a great great

951
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,839
question you're asking about sort of

952
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,680
market dynamics we're calling this sort

953
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,720
of a steady state equilibrium think of

954
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,839
this as short run versus long run in the

955
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,560
short run probably not right in the

956
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,880
short run you'll buy a certain am planes

957
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,680
they'll buy certain planes you'll you'll

958
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,280
fck around for a while and then you'll

959
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,960
say ah this is the point at which in the

960
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,319
long run things are stable so let's kind

961
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,160
of think of this more sort of a long run

962
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:21,240
versus a short run

963
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,920
okay other questions good question other

964
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,520
questions okay so basically let's look

965
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,400
at the math of the chono

966
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,480
equilibrium okay

967
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,200
so the first thing we do we don't do

968
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,119
this whatever the hell that

969
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:39,720
is the first thing we do is we solve for

970
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:42,000
each firm's residual demand curve and

971
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,319
it's a symmetric problem I could solve

972
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,359
this for one

973
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:47,560
firm and I know what I'll get for the

974
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,280
other firm I have to solve for one firm

975
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,079
so what is American's residual demand

976
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:58,480
curve well it's

977
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:59,599
339 minus QA minus qu I plugged in 64

978
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,280
before because I had some industrial

979
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,400
Espionage it was told me 64 but in

980
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,240
general I don't know what United's going

981
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,079
to do so I just put in this amount

982
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,520
qu

983
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:15,920
okay now what is revenue then revenue is

984
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,000
339 QA this is American's calculation of

985
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:24,520
its

986
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,520
Revenue minus QA 2 minus qu

987
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,680
QA what is marginal re Revenue well I

988
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,640
differentiate with respect to QA this is

989
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,359
American's decision so what it's his

990
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:40,079
marginal revenue it's

991
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:43,119
339 minus 2 QA minus

992
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,720
qu so now I've got a a new term in my

993
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,720
marginal revenue equation I didn't have

994
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,599
before in other examples the other

995
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,599
firm's quantity enters into my marginal

996
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,160
revenue so we set this equal to marginal

997
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,680
cost which is 147

998
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,400
once again symmetrically I said marginal

999
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,839
cost 147 for

1000
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,640
everybody set that equal the marginal

1001
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,400
cost

1002
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,280
okay by the way let me go back one

1003
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,119
second go back to the figure go back to

1004
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,079
figure 131 and 132 one thing that's

1005
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,800
implicit I didn't say is an example

1006
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,200
average cost also equals marginal cost

1007
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,880
for the relevant range right because

1008
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,079
marginal cost is flat so the relevant

1009
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,880
range we're examining here average cost

1010
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,960
equals marginal cost it' be marginal

1011
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,040
cost could be the same and average cost

1012
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,240
could be structure be different and then

1013
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,720
it get complicated again so really what

1014
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,160
assuming is basically cost structure is

1015
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,040
the same across the companies at least a

1016
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:39,960
relevant range okay so you set that

1017
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,960
equal to marginal cost you solve and you

1018
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:49,640
get you solve that and you get the

1019
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,640
QA equal 96 minus 12

1020
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,960
qu okay so now we don't get a

1021
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:02,000
deterministic answer we get that what I

1022
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:04,200
should fly is 96 -2 qu guess what that's

1023
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,599
the Blue Line in figure

1024
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,319
133 check it out it's 96 minus 1 12

1025
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:14,560
qu well it turns out the problem

1026
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:15,960
symmetric so United has the same best

1027
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,240
response

1028
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:24,040
function I could do the same math for

1029
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:27,040
United and i' get the qu equal 96 - 12

1030
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,040
QA

1031
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,440
qu = 96 - 12 QA because it's symmetric

1032
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,960
so guess what I have two equations and

1033
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,839
two unknowns I have two best response

1034
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,079
functions intersecting or maybe not two

1035
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:45,920
equations two unknowns so I can solve

1036
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:51,839
this these two equations in two

1037
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,839
unknowns and I can get that QA equals 64

1038
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,079
and by

1039
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:58,079
symmetry qu equal 64

1040
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,800
so that is how I just mathematically

1041
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,960
solved for that intersection now once

1042
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,760
again you might solve this if find no

1043
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,000
intersection two equations two unknowns

1044
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,559
you might get no rational answer and

1045
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
that would mean the market would just

1046
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,440
collapse okay or you get multiple

1047
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,280
answers and that's more

1048
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,160
complicated but generally you get one

1049
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,240
answer in this class at

1050
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,240
least okay and that with equilibrium

1051
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,240
yeah

1052
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:38,400
great question does anyone know great

1053
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,839
question because what's big Q here big Q

1054
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,319
now in the market is 128 and what's the

1055
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,640
price well we know the demand curve the

1056
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,480
demand curve hasn't changed demand curve

1057
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,839
is 339 minus Q it's one market demand

1058
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:56,640
curve so the new price is uh 339 minus

1059
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,640
128 so 211

1060
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,760
okay but Q is 128 whereas when just

1061
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,760
America is 96 great question

1062
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,640
why

1063
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:15,359
yeah like firm that controls everything

1064
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:18,000
PR PR well they're they're in between

1065
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,520
price takers and price makers but

1066
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,800
effectively the way we model it they're

1067
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,119
price takers but the intuition is when

1068
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,720
I'm

1069
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,520
monopolist I am maximizing the profits

1070
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,240
for me

1071
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,480
finding out what Max has my profits

1072
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,920
which is a high price and a low quantity

1073
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,359
once I'm sharing the market think about

1074
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,559
the Monopoly poison effect this is a

1075
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,520
great hint for what we'll cover next

1076
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,040
time think about what happens the

1077
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,119
Monopoly poisoning effect if I sell more

1078
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,319
in the market who bears that poisoning

1079
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,400
effect both of us because once Q goes up

1080
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:51,839
once big Q goes up the price Falls we

1081
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,640
both suffer from lower fall so it some

1082
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,400
says I'm offloading half of the

1083
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,680
poisoning effect when I'm monopolist

1084
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,480
every additional un price I want to

1085
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,440
sell low is my profit when I'm in this

1086
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,280
larger group there's sort of a sharing

1087
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,640
of the poisoning effect so each firm so

1088
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,640
you end up selling more what we'll show

1089
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,319
next time is why ex exactly this

1090
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,480
intuition will be clearer next time

1091
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,760
leads to cartels not to be

1092
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,480
functional and it's why we'll show next

1093
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,079
time the limit of oligopoly is perfect

1094
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,680
competition okay but the bottom line is

1095
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,920
when you get when you have a Coro

1096
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,319
equilibrium you end up with an answer

1097
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,720
that is not perfect competition remember

1098
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:38,839
what would perfect competition say the

1099
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,079
quantity would be can anyone tell me

1100
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:42,079
what would the quantity be under perfect

1101
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:47,000
competition what would big Q be in this

1102
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,000
market with perfect

1103
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,440
competition it involves one one equation

1104
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,559
solving one equation

1105
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,559
yeah it'd be n and how'd you get that

1106
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,839
uh no perfect competition perfect that's

1107
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:06,359
exactly this question here if there's

1108
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,440
perfect competition what would yeah in

1109
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:11,680
the

1110
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,680
back what 64 how'd you get

1111
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,119
that well well okay that's one way to do

1112
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,640
it what's another way to do it well if

1113
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,119
it's perfect competition what do we know

1114
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,040
come on guys got ready for tomorrow

1115
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:25,520
night what's the profit maximizing

1116
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,280
condition perfect competition price

1117
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,200
equals what marginal cost so we just say

1118
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,920
well look you want to competition price

1119
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,040
equals marginal cost so what's the price

1120
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,760
what's marginal cost 147 so you know

1121
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,720
price equals 147 and then you simply

1122
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,000
know that demand that the quantity is

1123
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,680
339 minus

1124
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,520
147 the quanti is going to be 3 339

1125
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:54,240
minus 147 which is going to be uh 192

1126
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:58,200
right is that right uh

1127
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:00,200
no uh no I got this wrong 33 9 - 147

1128
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:04,319
that's a hard math

1129
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:09,400
340 340 so

1130
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,960
200 200 yeah 192 right yeah 192 I don't

1131
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,319
have I'm really insecure about my math

1132
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:18,280
skills okay so 192

1133
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:21,160
192 is much bigger than Monopoly which

1134
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,720
was 96 it's also bigger than what we got

1135
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:27,040
in the oligopoly

1136
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:31,400
case so what we see is oligopoly leads

1137
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,160
us to be in between Monopoly and perfect

1138
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,520
competition and we'll come back next

1139
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,160
time review that and tell you why that

1140
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,960
is show you why that is all right okay

1141
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,359
let's stop there good luck tomorrow

1142
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,480
night I'll see yall bright and early on

1143
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,480
Wednesday and we'll continue this

1144
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,480
discussion
