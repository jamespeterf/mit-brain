00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,200
Hi, I'm Mark Lindseay and I'm a

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,960
cardiologist specializing in genetic

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,080
arterial disease at the Massachusetts

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,400
General Hospital.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,240
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Praep Nodarajin and I'm the

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
director of preventive cardiology and

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,320
genetics researcher at Mass General

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
Hospital and the Broad Institute of MIT

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
and Harvard.

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,960
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Tiffany Bellow and I'm a

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,920
vascular surgery resident at the

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,920
Massachusetts General Hospital.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,920
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,760
or SCAD is defined as a tear or a

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
separation in the wall of the coronary

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,920
artery, but it's not associated with

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
aththeroscerosis or trauma.

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,719
>> Scad has been known to affect men and

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,360
women. However, SCAD most commonly

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,760
affects women. SCAD is a rare condition

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
linked to arterial fragility sometimes

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,079
caused by well-known genetic disorders

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,879
like vascular ellers stanlo syndrome

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,120
marfan syndrome and log gene syndrome.

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,040
Researchers haven't yet found all the

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,439
genes that clearly increase the risk of

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
scat. We can increase the discovery of

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,080
genes associated with scat by collecting

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,040
health data and samples from larger and

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,040
more diverse patient groups.

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,960
GVAS is short for genetics of vascular

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
disease. This is a research study that

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,640
is designed to gather health information

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
from patients who have been diagnosed

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
with SCAD or other vascular

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,119
abnormalities. The study operates out of

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,079
Massachusetts General Hospital and the

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,960
Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,880
Participation in the GVAS study includes

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
completing surveys online about your

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,799
health information and providing a

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
saliva sample which can be mailed to

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,600
your home. All information will be kept

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,520
confidential and in a secure database

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,079
and will never be sold for profit.

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,159
The GVAS study aims to perform the

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,960
largest sequencing project to date of

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,360
individuals with SCAD. We are working

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,920
together to create a research community

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,320
of individuals highly motivated to

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
investigate the genetics of SCAD and set

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,319
the foundation for future research. This

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,720
community is enhanced by the

54
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,080
contributions and partnership from the

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,920
ISCAD registry and SCAD Alliance which

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
also aim to better understand and

57
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,680
support patients with SCAD.

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,400
>> We invite members of the SCAD community

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
to join the GVAS research study and

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
share it with others.

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
>> Your partnership will be key in

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
understanding why SCADAD happens and how

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,680
it can be prevented and treated.
