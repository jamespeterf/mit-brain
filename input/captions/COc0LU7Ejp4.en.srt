00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and education is key to action.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Day of Climate is a new initiative that brings together the full strength of MIT

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
—our researchers, educators, and learners

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,000
to research climate science, realize its impacts, and design real-world solutions.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This challenge facing our planet requires a new generation of pioneers, bold thinkers and fearless problem-solvers. 

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
By investing in K-12 learners today 

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
we cultivate the scientists, engineers, and visionaries 

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
who will create a more sustainable future. 

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, join us at MIT’s Day of Climate

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where knowledge meets action.
