00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,200
hello welcome to the autoimmune disease

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,720
machine learning challenge thank you for

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,040
joining us my name is or ashenberg and I

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,040
a director of computational biology at

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,320
the Bro Institute where I work at the

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,400
interface of machine learning biology

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,520
and human disease we have put together

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,680
these three introductory lectures to get

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
you up to speed on autoimmune disease

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,359
and how we hope to use machine learning

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,880
to better understand and treat these

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,560
complex diseases since the completion of

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,439
the Human Genome Project in 2023 the

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,800
live Sciences have been in an ongoing

15
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,960
Revolution where our ability to measure

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,160
and perturb biological systems in both

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,200
health and disease has been radically

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,120
transformed however these new

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,360
technologies generate complex

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,600
high-dimensional multimodal data that

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,879
requires advances in machine learning in

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,120
order to distill biological meaning and

23
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,600
translate to clinical impact and that's

24
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,280
where you will have a chance to really

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,600
make a difference so let's get

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,120
started so first let me give you an

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,199
overview of the crash course so there

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,280
three lectures the first is going to be

29
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:05,720
the biology of autoimmune disease and

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,520
then the second lecture will be the

31
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,520
technologies that we use to profile

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,119
autoimmune disease and then the final

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,600
lecture will be on the data that we've

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,040
assembled for this competition and the

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,560
three crunches that you're going to be

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,680
working on over the course of the

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
competition so let's start with the

38
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,799
biology of autoimmune

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,200
disease so this lecture is divided into

40
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,560
four parts first we'll discuss what is

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,759
autoimmune disease then we'll talk about

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,960
autoimmune disease in our gut

43
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,320
and how a pathologist can make a

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,479
diagnosis of this type of disease and

45
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,320
finally we'll talk about how certain

46
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,200
autoimmune diseases can increase your

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,840
chances of catching

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,960
cancer so first let's talk about what is

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,920
autoimmune disease to understand this we

50
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,799
need a basic understanding of our immune

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,680
systems so our immune systems operate

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,439
throughout our bodies to protect us

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,520
against Real threats such as cancer

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,680
viral infections bacteria and when your

55
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,399
immune system encounters these threats

56
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,280
it initiates inflammation and the

57
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,319
classic symptoms of inflammation are

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,520
swelling pain redness um we're all

59
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,120
familiar with this and this triggers a

60
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,360
very big immune response that ultimately

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,080
uh Works to recognize the threat

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,519
eliminate the threat and promote tissue

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,120
repair so that's what we want to happen

64
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,239
in a healthy immune response now in

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,800
contrast in autoimmune disease you get

66
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,120
these same forces acting but they're

67
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,280
getting activated in the absence of of

68
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,480
any real threat so you start to get

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,440
inflammation in your colon or your

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,360
kidney or your brain and you get this

71
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,959
big immune response that leads to tissue

72
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,280
damage and this causes diseases such as

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,680
lupus uh multiple sclerosis type 1

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,360
diabetes and ulcerative colitis which is

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,000
the focus of this

76
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,959
competition and you might be asking well

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,879
why would your immune system respond in

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,920
this way well first of all all of us

79
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,480
have different uh variants in our genes

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,040
in our body and these variant give us a

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
different predisposition to certain

82
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,840
diseases so somebody might be at greater

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,959
risk for ulcerative colitis and somebody

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,400
else might be at greater risk for Lupus

85
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,040
but it's not the genes alone that

86
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,959
determine whether you get an autoimmune

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,239
disease it's also the interactions with

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,799
our environment so a change in diet or

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,519
air pollution or toxins in the

90
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,840
environment can increase your chances of

91
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,440
autoimmune disease in addition the

92
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,519
microbes living in our gut or different

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,200
uh viral infections for instance so

94
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,040
those are some of the reasons people can

95
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,879
get um autoimmune

96
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,920
disease now very concerningly the

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,799
prevalence of autoimmune disease is

98
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,840
increasing around the world and this

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,840
comes at huge cost to patients and

100
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,239
public health so here we're looking at a

101
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,640
graph of different autoimmune diseases

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,200
and their prevalence over time and you

103
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,640
can see that all these diseases have

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,120
been going up over the last few decades

105
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,439
and in particular um inflammatory bowel

106
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,599
disease which is what you'll be working

107
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,720
on in this competition has really gone

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,720
up over the last 20 or 30 years
