1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,839
so what we're going to talk about uh

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,120
this afternoon next half hour or so is

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:11,120
around the role of corporate culture in

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,040
Innovation and uh also Innovations in

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,360
measuring corporate culture so we'll uh

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,279
we'll talk about how Innovation and

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,480
culture affect each other a couple of

8
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,920
ways so to tee this off there was

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,800
recently a survey done by some

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,000
colleagues at warten of about 1,400 CEOs

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,960
in

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,640
CFOs and the survey was around what they

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,439
saw as the most important factors in uh

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,680
their organization's ability to create

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,719
and capture economic value and what the

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,800
survey revealed is first of all more

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,120
than nine out of 10 CEOs and

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,000
CFOs said they believe that a healthy

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,879
culture helped to uh increase firm value

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,440
that's not social value that's not

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,719
employee value that might have also been

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,079
true this is about economic Financial

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,199
results also eight out of 10 of them

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,960
listed culture among the top five

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,680
factors you know you could think of

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,080
inovation and uh uh IP Market position

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
lots of things that could influence

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,240
value creation but 80% of them listed

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,080
culture among the top five factors okay

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,080
so culture

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,720
matters so what do we mean when we talk

32
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,320
about

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,159
culture and actually you know what I

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,439
think I I apologize I have I'm literally

35
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,159
giving three speeches today uh and I'm

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,399
giving you all about culture but all

37
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,479
with a slightly different spin uh yes

38
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,720
this was my CFO speech so I know this is

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,759
not a group of CFOs so my apologies uh

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,200
let me get to the Innovation conference

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,200
one yes okay here we

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,960
go good morning Johannesburg where are

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,600
we today okay so the tea off the tea off

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,640
is the same the culture matters it just

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,000
is going to matter a little bit

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,119
differently when we're talking uh to a a

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,880
group of folks who are concerned about

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,920
R&D as opposed to uh CFOs okay so

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,719
culture

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,840
matters but we all know you can't manage

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,400
you can't improve what you can't measure

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,680
so a a core question even if you believe

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,680
the culture matters that you have to

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,239
face is how do we measure culture okay

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,360
so probably the most common answer I get

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,640
when I ask uh Executives how they

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
measure culture is they say well look

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,680
here is our here are our core values

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
here are here's our official culture

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,599
that's what our culture is uh and we did

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,440
a study of about uh nearly 700 large uh

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,040
mainly us-based companies and what we

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,680
found was over 80% of them had an

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,560
official stated corporate culture uh

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,519
that almost all cases took the form of a

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,760
handful of core values okay and so a lot

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,519
of Executives when you ask them about

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,680
their culture they point to those core

69
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,360
values and the core values are things

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,560
like what's right for the customer or

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,480
ethics

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,959
right okay that sounds plausible Until

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,680
you realize the source of these core

74
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,680
values was Wells Fargo those were the

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,120
core values of Wells Fargo the year

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,400
before they were found to have

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,799
perpetrated the largest consumer

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,560
financial fraud in US

79
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,400
history which suggests that hey you know

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,159
what maybe official core values are not

81
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,840
the best measure of your actual

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,159
culture um and you know this is

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,519
anecdotal you know we don't at MIT we

84
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,319
don't love anecdotes we like data better

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,159
uh so what I and my team did was looked

86
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,959
at a sample slightly smaller samples

87
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,480
about 500 companies where those

88
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,760
companies had publicly stated core

89
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,239
values and we looked at what core values

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
they emphasized and how heavily they

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,319
weighed those core values and then we

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,879
separately looked at how employees

93
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,280
talked about how their company did on

94
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,360
exactly those core values that

95
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,280
emphasized okay and the idea was is

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,239
there a correlation between the official

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,079
core values what companies say they

98
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,280
emphasize what their culture is and how

99
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,360
employees say those organizations are

100
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,239
doing against those values benchmarked

101
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,919
against industry

102
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,040
peers and we did this for the nine most

103
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:25,680
frequently cited core values in our

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,759
sample this is what we found so what

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,960
you're seeing in this chart uh each of

106
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,000
the columns I guess represents one of

107
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,440
the top nine core

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,160
values and the uh the point estimates

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,120
with the confidence intervals those are

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,800
the

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,000
correlations between what companies said

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,240
they valued and what employees said the

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,160
companies did

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,240
well punchline no correlation

115
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,120
essentially I mean you know in seven of

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,479
the nine cases the confidence interval

117
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,680
included zero in all of them it was you

118
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
know what we would not consider a

119
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,440
consequential correlation coefficient so

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,840
okay so if we're trying we have to

121
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,720
measure culture but just relying on our

122
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,039
official core values is going to be a

123
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,520
very V very poor measure of our

124
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,440
underlying

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,000
culture another common approach probably

126
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,280
the most common approach that we find in

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,680
terms of measuring culture is to give uh

128
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,240
employees long lists often uh in

129
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,880
Employee Engagement surveys is the the

130
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,199
uh data collection mechanism most

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,120
frequently uh used for this long list of

132
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,360
questions asking about various elements

133
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,840
of culture so how many of you have

134
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,240
filled one of these out at some point in

135
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,800
your career okay great so you're

136
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,199
familiar with this and and what you know

137
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,639
of course what leaders are hoping is

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,080
going to happen when they give employees

139
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,720
a survey with 50 or 100 questions as

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,600
they're hoping the employees are going

141
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,280
to read every one of those questions

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,360
carefully and think about them and

143
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,759
provide a an accurate answer as to how

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,440
well it's working right which would lead

145
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,120
to if that were the case would lead to a

146
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,919
distribution of responses that looks

147
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,400
something like this right there would be

148
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,840
some things we're doing well on some

149
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,000
things we're not doing so well on some

150
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,720
things we're doing really poor land

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,240
that's what you would hope to

152
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,680
see

153
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,479
employees uh uh do when they provided

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,919
this feedback that is not what we see

155
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,639
empirically what we see empirically is

156
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,919
distributions that look much more like

157
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,599
this that is to say employees or

158
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,599
respondents go on autopilot if they're

159
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,080
in a good mood or happy they give you

160
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,319
all fours and fives across the board on

161
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
questions that you would expect to have

162
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,000
very different answers if they're

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,800
unhappy all ones and twos across the

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,120
board even on issues uh and topics that

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
you would expect to see very different

166
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,639
responses

167
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,199
to and it uh what we did again just to

168
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,880
understand this is very very well

169
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,479
documented in political polling uh and

170
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,960
in survey design more generally uh but

171
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,479
we were looking specifically at the

172
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,560
extent to which this

173
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,360
autopilot occurs when employees are

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,080
filling out Employee Engagement surveys

175
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,039
answering questions about culture okay

176
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,919
and we took a sample of 11 Employee

177
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,800
Engagement surveys filled out by over

178
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:20,360
900,000 employees ranging between uh 14

179
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,319
questions and 111 questions okay and

180
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,160
what we were trying to measure was the

181
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,120
extent to which employees just use the

182
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,240
same answers for every question and what

183
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,599
we found was the following

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
and let me just explain what's happening

185
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,160
on this chart on the x-axis what we're

186
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,800
seeing is the number of questions in the

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,280
survey again ranging from 14 to 111 that

188
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,440
was the range in our sample on the y

189
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,520
axis it's the percentage of questions

190
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,680
that the typical employe answers with

191
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,800
the same

192
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,479
response and the key finding here is

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,840
it's about

194
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,319
90% basically 90% of the questions you

195
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,879
ask employees about your culture no

196
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,080
matter how different those factors might

197
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,720
actually be they're going to give you

198
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
the same one or two

199
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,840
responses the other thing that I find

200
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,199
interesting about this and is a bit of a

201
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,919
methodological point but it's still

202
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,599
interesting this kicks in with a very

203
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,159
small number of questions right you

204
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,919
could imagine like okay at a 100

205
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,080
questions people are just the cognitive

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,240
load is so high that they just default

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,400
to giving you all the same answer but

208
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,159
this is at 14 questions we see the same

209
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,639
thing

210
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,240
happening so culture matters you got to

211
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,479
measure it

212
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,399
core values are a poor measure and the

213
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,519
most common approach which is long lists

214
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,080
of liquor scales uh questions is also

215
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,120
very poor approach I should mention by

216
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,959
the way this what you think you're doing

217
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,880
when you give these long surveys is you

218
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:49,000
think you're getting the answer to 50 or

219
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,200
100 questions you're not you're getting

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,839
one good answer to one question are

221
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,480
employees engaged or not that's what's

222
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,040
really happening and by the way you only

223
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,680
need two questions you can ask two

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,399
questions and you get 95% of the

225
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,560
information content in of a 100

226
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,720
questions in answering that one okay so

227
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,040
that doesn't work as well and this

228
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,839
brings us to the subject of our

229
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,680
discussion which is what I'm very

230
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,600
excited about my team is very excited

231
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,560
about is the power of

232
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,399
AI to

233
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,360
analiz free text data to shed light on

234
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,720
what's happening with

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,640
culture and this is something that we've

236
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,519
uh We've researched quite a bit and and

237
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,240
written about quite a bit so the basic

238
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,360
idea the basic Insight here is that

239
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,440
instead of relying on these multiple

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
choice questions which for a variety of

241
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,560
reasons do not contain such a great

242
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,320
amount of information content instead

243
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,880
the core data that we're going to

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,440
leverage the kind of gold mine of data

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,839
that we're going to exploit in this um

246
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,519
uh in this analytical methodology is

247
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,320
free text not do the employees say you

248
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,360
know I like the culture I don't like the

249
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,279
culture but what do they say what's

250
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,920
working what's not working what advice

251
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,920
would they give to

252
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,640
management and what's interesting about

253
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,000
this one of the powerful things about

254
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,880
this methodology is every one of your

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,800
organizations has a book and that book

256
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,480
is written by you and your fellow

257
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,120
employees and that book in a typical

258
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,560
large organization will be thousands and

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,600
thousands of pages long and just think

260
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,880
about all the the places where employees

261
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,120
are providing free text feedback about

262
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,760
what's working in the organization

263
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,079
what's not working what they would like

264
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,959
to change so internally open-ended

265
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,760
surveys you know Ma 360 feedback exit

266
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,600
interviews employe uh focus groups to

267
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,839
the extent those are uh those

268
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,120
discussions are transcribed suggestion

269
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,279
boxes in large organizations there could

270
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,040
be a dozen different mechanisms whereby

271
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,959
free text uh data and feedback is

272
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,120
gathered for employees that's just

273
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,680
internal

274
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,040
data you know over the past 20 years

275
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,920
there's been an explosion in terms of

276
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,920
external fora for employees to talk

277
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,839
about their company you know glass store

278
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,079
indeed obviously but Twitter Reddit and

279
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:22,560
other places so the punchline is there

280
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:25,800
is an enormous volume of data out

281
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,360
there that sheds light on your

282
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,760
organization's culture and the question

283
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,519
is how can you

284
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:38,480
make sense of that data and that's where

285
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:40,079
AI offers um uh a lot of potential so

286
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,680
I'm going to illustrate that potential

287
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm going to share with you the results

288
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,079
of some analysis uh we've done using

289
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,720
glass store data so glass store is an

290
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:53,639
interesting data source so it's it

291
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,399
is almost

292
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:00,920
certainly the most extensive I mean at

293
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,639
present they have about 40 million

294
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,320
reviews

295
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,440
comparable publicly available insightful

296
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,279
source of data on corporate culture not

297
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,160
only that we have now that we've

298
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,680
probably ever had in history right this

299
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,279
these online data re uh review sites

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,560
didn't exist 20 years

301
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,160
ago now some of you will be sitting

302
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,440
there and saying like oh glass door

303
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,040
forget it we ignore glass door in my

304
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,279
company because in my company we know

305
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,880
that glass door is where disgruntled

306
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:34,639
employees go to vent okay and therefore

307
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,360
we know we can safely afford to ignore

308
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:43,160
glass door as a source of data and

309
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,920
feedback empirically demonstrably wrong

310
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,519
okay if you there are a variety of

311
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,320
analyses we can do to make this point

312
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,440
I'll just use the simplest

313
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,199
one this is uh for a uh this is just um

314
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,600
I think this is just us data although

315
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,320
the the global data looks quite similar

316
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,120
um this is basically the distribution of

317
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,279
culture value ratings by on a one to

318
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,680
five scale in Glass St and what you see

319
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,199
is it actually skew it's more normal

320
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,920
than you might expect I mean

321
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,920
interestingly most online review sites

322
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,480
are highly polarized it tends to be ones

323
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,480
and fives uh and then not much in the

324
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,440
middle uh because only people who really

325
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,399
hate a service or love a service have

326
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,760
the incentive to write reviews glass

327
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,440
door is much more less polarized more

328
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,040
normal looking uh than than the typical

329
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,639
online review site it's because they've

330
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,360
adopted some policies that induce um

331
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,680
reviewers with moderate uh views to to

332
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,560
write reviews uh and actually skew

333
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,399
somewhat positive okay so if that's your

334
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,040
concern like we don't you know in my

335
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,120
company we don't take glass door

336
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,480
seriously that's just

337
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:55,079
wrong okay so let me let me illustrate

338
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:58,399
um the the power of this methodology of

339
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:00,959
you harnessing this uh uh this gold mine

340
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,160
of free Tech data using AI to shed light

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,120
on corporate culture and what I'm going

342
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,440
to do is I've chosen a single industry

343
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,079
so typically when you're studying

344
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,480
Culture by the way it's super helpful to

345
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,959
um uh to control for industry right

346
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,800
because if you're looking at fast food

347
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,360
and you're comparing it to you know

348
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,000
enterprise software those just really

349
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,320
aren't the uh the companies in those

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,399
Industries are not comparable with one

351
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
another so you want to control for

352
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,680
industry so that's what we're doing here

353
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,519
and I've just chosen I think I might

354
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,720
have gone alphabetically actually and

355
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:34,079
gone with Aerospace and defense um

356
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,399
and so what we're seeing here is uh um

357
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,680
this is a list of large Aerospace and

358
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,800
defense

359
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,639
players and these are their average

360
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,399
culture and value scores so when an

361
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,800
employee writes a glass St review

362
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,759
they're they uh you know there's asked

363
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,360
to evaluate the culture and values one

364
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,759
to five just take an average of that you

365
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,000
know uh have a confidence interval and

366
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,079
this is what we

367
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,920
see I mean it tells you something right

368
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,759
I mean obviously moo is doing better

369
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,920
than whoever is over there uh UniFi I

370
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:12,560
guess um so there's some information

371
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,240
there but it really doesn't tell you

372
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,720
that much about the nature of the

373
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,160
culture why do employees in one company

374
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,639
like the culture better than another

375
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,000
what is the difference between those

376
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,800
cultures so what we're going to do is

377
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,880
we're going to take two companies that

378
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,720
are both in the same both in this

379
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,600
industry both that have good cultures

380
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,360
but are very different from one another

381
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,279
okay so we're going to take SpaceX which

382
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,279
is here and Lockheed Martin okay and

383
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,959
what we see here is yeah locked Martin's

384
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,600
average is a little bit higher they're

385
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,120
they're both above the average but

386
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,480
little bit higher the you know the

387
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,160
confidence intervals a little bit

388
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,920
tighter but really if if this is all the

389
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,720
information we have about culture hard

390
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,959
to say much hard to conclude

391
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,680
much but that's not all the information

392
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,319
we have what we also have is something

393
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,000
like

394
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:06,000
60,000 postco

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,759
reviews where people write out they give

396
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,519
yes they assign a a score on a one to

397
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,120
five scale but they also write out what

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,759
they like what they don't like what

399
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
feedback or advice they have for

400
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,079
management and that's going to be the

401
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,800
data that we're going to use to gain

402
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,759
more insight into the culture so what

403
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,160
we're doing here is we basically have

404
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,880
built an AI

405
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,160
platform uh it it's a combination it's

406
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,160
kind of a hybrid llm rules-based model

407
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,519
they work very well together um and it

408
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,279
it essentially reads the text and

409
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,079
classifies the text into 500 topics that

410
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,600
are anchored in research okay where we

411
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,639
have a clear definition and have a

412
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,199
agreed upon ways to measure those topics

413
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,519
so uh it just kind of goes through and

414
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:57,319
assigns each of these little chunks of

415
00:16:52,519 --> 00:17:02,079
text to um to topics and at the same

416
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:03,720
time assesses the sentiment um of the uh

417
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,799
whether the employee the respondent is

418
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,000
talking about this specific topic

419
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,480
positively or negatively okay so that's

420
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,199
the first thing we do is we take very

421
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,720
unstructured textual data and convert it

422
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:19,559
into structured essentially tabular

423
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,079
data then what we're able to do is

424
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:26,720
aggregate those you know 50 or 60,000

425
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:30,000
reviews and the results that we have and

426
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,000
say okay for any one of these topics or

427
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,320
we actually aggregate the topics into

428
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,240
broader themes that subsume multiple

429
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,080
topics but for every um for every one of

430
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,919
these topics or themes let's see how the

431
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,600
companies compare to one another right

432
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,720
just seeing that you know a lot of

433
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,600
people Grumble about schedule in your

434
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,440
company uh it's hard to say maybe that's

435
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,080
an industry factor maybe that's true of

436
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,559
all big companies you know to tease out

437
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,159
whether that's idiosyncratic to a firm

438
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:02,159
in its culture you want to Benchmark it

439
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:04,799
against its peer so what we do here is

440
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:09,200
we then say okay let's take a single

441
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:12,000
theme in this case schedule okay and

442
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,720
we'll take our our our sample of

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,720
Aerospace and defense

444
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,159
companies and let's now that we've trans

445
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,000
we've converted this unstructured data

446
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,440
to structured data using AI let's then

447
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,720
see how our focal companies SpaceX and

448
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,200
Lockheed Martin do on schedule and so

449
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,559
what we see here the x-axis here is the

450
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,360
percentage of employees who mention

451
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,520
unprompted remember they just their

452
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,880
prompt is Pros cons feedback that's it

453
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,520
so they can write whatever they want and

454
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,480
what we see when given that prompt that

455
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,520
open-ended prompt uh just over 30% of uh

456
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480
uh locked Martin employees mention

457
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,679
schedule and they're quite positive

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,360
about it about 70% of those who mention

459
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,559
schedule are positive about it SpaceX in

460
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,320
contrast uh it's a higher percentage

461
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,600
that mention it maybe I don't know from

462
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:06,360
here 30 6% maybe um so very Salient

463
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,799
issue very top of mind but uh employees

464
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,640
are much more negative about it they're

465
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,520
only positive about it about something

466
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,679
like 22% of the

467
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,880
time and so we're able to start picking

468
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,919
apart like okay that's not just an

469
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,880
aerospace and defense thing schedule

470
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,480
there is variance on this dimension of

471
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,799
culture across firms within the same

472
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,360
industry and then we can do that for all

473
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,600
of the topics where we com we create a

474
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,760
combined metric that it takes into

475
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,559
account both the frequency with which uh

476
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,840
uh respondents mention a topic and the

477
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,880
the percentage

478
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,760
sentiment and then we can compare across

479
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,280
hundreds of topics how companies differ

480
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,840
from their industry and how they differ

481
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,880
from one another okay and that allows us

482
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,919
then to really get a much more granular

483
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,240
sense of what the culture is good at and

484
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,520
not good at in

485
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,600
the voice of the employees the people

486
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,280
who know best whether the culture is

487
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,720
working or not so just to give you a

488
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,159
sense of how you can then kind of

489
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,039
aggregate this so what we're doing here

490
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,600
now and let me just take a second to

491
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,159
explain this because it's not um

492
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,559
entirely clear so what we've done here

493
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,679
is we're comparing SpaceX which is the

494
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,240
black bar to Lockheed Martin which is

495
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,960
the blue bar we've taken a set of themes

496
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,159
so themes like Innovation includes I

497
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,360
think maybe a topics experimentation

498
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,440
willingness to take risks there are a

499
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,600
set of topics there um that we aggregate

500
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,080
to themes okay and that by aggregating

501
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,360
uh independent topics to themes the

502
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,159
results are slightly more robust and

503
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,720
what we're doing here is we're saying

504
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:51,640
okay let's look

505
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,679
how uh in this case SpaceX the black bar

506
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,360
how much more frequently and positively

507
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,240
they talk about a topic relative to the

508
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,280
industry mean okay so these are Z scores

509
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,520
so this is expressed as this combined

510
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,720
metric that takes into account both

511
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,039
frequency and sentiment uh it's the

512
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,720
score for SpaceX how many standard

513
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,000
deviations it is above the industry mean

514
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,640
so what we're seeing is Perks um there

515
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,480
are 2.4 standard deviations above the

516
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,320
mean so that doesn't look like noise

517
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,679
that looks like real signal uh and for

518
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,400
locked Martin they're about half a

519
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,600
standard deviation below the industry

520
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,960
mean who knows half a standard deviation

521
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,159
I don't know I'm not sure how much

522
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,679
information content there is and then we

523
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,279
just do that for the themes that rank

524
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,559
highest in terms of standard deviations

525
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:44,720
above the industry mean for

526
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,760
SpaceX okay and so what's interesting

527
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,320
here is now instead of just knowing ah

528
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,679
SpaceX is above average on their culture

529
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,440
values average ranking but a little bit

530
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,200
below lock heat Martin which doesn't

531
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,000
tell us really very much we can start to

532
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,000
characterize the elements of of the

533
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,600
culture in

534
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,320
SpaceX so and the story that kind of

535
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,760
emerges here is that you've got an

536
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,480
organization where the employees feel

537
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,039
very strongly and positively about the

538
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,039
mission and purpose they feel that the

539
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,960
work is interesting and meaningful it's

540
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:19,400
very Innovative very agile

541
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,200
organization and as a result employees

542
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,120
feel like owners and they're very

543
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,080
engaged okay so you start to get a sense

544
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,960
and we can get much more granular we can

545
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,559
decompose any of these themes into the

546
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,360
constituent topics of which there might

547
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,679
be half a dozen to a dozen for any one

548
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,679
of them and we get more granular on

549
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,760
those but this this starts to give you a

550
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,760
sense of the the culture of a

551
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,760
SpaceX now let's look at loed

552
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,679
Martin and again we're at the same

553
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,559
exercise in this case now the blue again

554
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,919
the blue uh the blue lines are Lockheed

555
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,559
Martins you know kind of combined uh

556
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,240
aggregate uh senmen and and incident

557
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:58,080
score for these themes and we're rank

558
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,559
ordering those that they're highest on

559
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,120
relative to their

560
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,400
industry and so just to remind you this

561
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,960
means that locki Martin is about 1.6

562
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,279
standard deviations above the industry

563
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,080
mean un Integrity so employees feel that

564
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,720
it's an organization with high levels of

565
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:17,320
Integrity ethical doesn't cut

566
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,159
Corners uh and and and we list again the

567
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,840
those U those themes that um uh that

568
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,600
Lockheed Martin scores the highest on

569
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,840
and again it starts to give us a sense

570
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,480
of what the culture of Lockheed Martin

571
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,640
is that's different from the industry

572
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,960
how they distinguish themselves from the

573
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,880
industry how they distinguish themselves

574
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,320
from SpaceX so you know this is an

575
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,200
organization with high levels of

576
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,720
Integrity not viewed as toxic viewed as

577
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,000
a healthy non-toxic culture uh a lot of

578
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,919
job security uh and employees in

579
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,679
contrast to what we saw with SpaceX are

580
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,640
very positive about the schedule and

581
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:57,880
work life balance okay and

582
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,840
so the the point is the liquor scale

583
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,000
question whether you had one question or

584
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,080
a 100 could not tell you this right it's

585
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,320
only through applying the AI to the free

586
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,360
the voluminous free text that you can

587
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,559
start to profile and understand the

588
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,159
culture and and I want to be clear here

589
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,039
by the way I'm not saying one is good

590
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,360
and one is bad I was very interesting I

591
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,320
was at a dinner uh about a year ago with

592
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,360
a general in the def us defense

593
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,400
department and we're talking about I'm

594
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,720
doing this study on on these you know

595
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,200
Innovation culture across different

596
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Industries I was tell sharing with him

597
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,120
what we were learning about Aerospace

598
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,559
and defense and he said completely

599
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,360
consistent with his experience but he

600
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,399
said don't think one is good and one is

601
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,600
bad said SpaceX we want the Innovation

602
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,679
we want the agility locked Martin we

603
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,520
want the stability and the reliability

604
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,960
and the good corporate citizen aspect if

605
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,480
you have a platform that lasts 30 40 50

606
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,039
years that matters a lot we want both so

607
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,559
I'm not saying one is good and one is

608
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,640
bad I'm just saying they are very very

609
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:55,840
different

610
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,840
cultures

611
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,320
so I we're doing a project now which I

612
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,480
think is very Germaine to this audience

613
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,440
so I'll share with you the findings if

614
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,080
you promise me that you won't quote them

615
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,679
or cite them because this is very much

616
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,200
work in progress okay so this

617
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,880
preliminary findings subject to revision

618
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,600
we have a bunch of robustness tests to

619
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,919
do but I thought I just throw it out

620
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,559
there because it's kind of fun and

621
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:20,760
interesting and relevant in this

622
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:23,360
context so the basic the the research

623
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,559
design here is so the starting point is

624
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,520
if you ask people like what are

625
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,960
organizations that are Innovative

626
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,919
probably six out of out of 10 people

627
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,399
will say something about Silicon Valley

628
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,520
Tech companies and Silicon Valley

629
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,679
there's a widespread perception and some

630
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,919
good empirical data supporting it that

631
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,279
Silicon Valley startups are very

632
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,960
Innovative so what we thought was let's

633
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,039
see if we can characterize those aspects

634
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,960
of Silicon Valley companies that are

635
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,960
distinctive from incumbents in their

636
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,840
industry okay and it's just descriptive

637
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,279
at this point there's no we're not

638
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,880
making any clausal claims so what we did

639
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:02,480
was we identified about 2700 Silicon

640
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,200
Valley startups defined as founded since

641
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,159
2010 uh headquartered and based in

642
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,840
Silicon Valley and Venture back which we

643
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,640
use as a proxy for tech tech intensive

644
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,760
right so it's not a perfect proxy but

645
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,240
not a terrible proxy and that gives us

646
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,679
about 19 190,000 reviews over the time

647
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,000
period we're looking

648
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,679
at now the problem is a lot of those

649
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,760
startups because they're small they

650
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,279
don't have a lot of reviews and so it's

651
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,799
hard to do this analysis when you don't

652
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,880
have a lot of reviews for an individual

653
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,799
organization

654
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,000
so what we do is we assign each of these

655
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,880
startups to one of 41

656
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,080
Industries and then for those in each

657
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,960
each of those 41 Industries we pull the

658
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,399
reviews from all the startups and you

659
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,679
know have one Mega startup in that

660
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:48,120
industry okay now of course there's

661
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,960
going to be variants across those

662
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,600
startups that we're going to obscure

663
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,240
with this methodology but we're looking

664
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,799
for the commonalities so okay um it's uh

665
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,039
fair enough we do some robustness checks

666
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,840
where we have companies that are big

667
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,720
enough to have enough reviews to analyze

668
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,799
separately that meet our criteria we

669
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,640
find the findings are are basically the

670
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,679
same so reasonably confident that's an

671
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,559
okay

672
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,640
assumption and then what we do is what

673
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:16,520
we just did but instead of comparing um

674
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,080
SpaceX or locked Martin to the Aerospace

675
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,840
and defense industry We compare this

676
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,720
synthetic startup with the pulled

677
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,360
reviews to its industry that's it and

678
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,279
then we look at um uh averages across

679
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,240
the industries and consistency across

680
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,720
industry so that's the that's the basic

681
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,480
idea and again this is preliminary

682
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,159
research these you know these findings

683
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,080
are subject to revision as we uh as we

684
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,600
dig into this more so the first chart

685
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,279
I'm showing here is and I also I also

686
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,120
don't know quite what to make of all of

687
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,200
this it's you know it's it's we're still

688
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,480
in the digestion stage so what we're

689
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,799
doing here is across our 41 Industries

690
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,519
we're saying what is the average we're

691
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,559
looking at the things where the startups

692
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,960
do best relative to the incumbents okay

693
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,240
average across the

694
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,039
industries and so one thing and again I

695
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,519
didn't have strong priors on this I mean

696
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:12,159
I had some weak priors on this but my my

697
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,640
weak priors were not I I mean there were

698
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,679
plenty of surprises here the biggest

699
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,840
difference is how employees and startups

700
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,960
talk about their colleagues that's the

701
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,519
biggest cluster of differences and and

702
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,120
there we have done a bunch of robustness

703
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,120
checks this is super robust so they

704
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,000
describ their colleagues as intelligent

705
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,279
ENT impressive hardworking committed to

706
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,919
the organization that's the biggest

707
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,679
cluster of differences between startups

708
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,919
and incumbents which raised a very super

709
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,440
interesting question is like how much of

710
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,360
the success of startups at Innovation is

711
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,240
just their ability to attract and uh get

712
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,440
gain the commitment of really talented

713
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,799
people interesting question I I don't

714
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,799
think that's often how how we frame uh

715
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,720
the success of startups the second

716
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,399
cluster is not surprising at all it's a

717
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,600
cluster around Innovation creativity

718
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,279
openness to new ideas experimentation

719
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,640
that's kind of why we chose these

720
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:10,440
companies we would expect to see that um

721
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,600
the third CL the third is Around Mission

722
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,240
uh much as we saw with um with SpaceX um

723
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,799
interestingly again this is one that I

724
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,480
didn't necessarily suspect maybe it's a

725
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,480
function of size of organization uh but

726
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,120
employees in startups are much more

727
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,960
positive about teamwork and the

728
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,159
environment being supportive which was

729
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,919
not you know I would have guessed that

730
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,799
necessarily um and then also that the

731
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,399
work is more interesting and they view

732
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,880
it as more meaningful okay so those are

733
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,279
the things and again this is preliminary

734
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,480
you know we're still kind of chunking

735
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,640
through the analysis here but some you

736
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,000
know kind of it illustrates the kind of

737
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,880
questions you can address with this AI

738
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,880
applied to free text Data um and you

739
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,880
know may have some interesting uh

740
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,039
insights what about the things that

741
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,080
startups do worse than incumbents and so

742
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,600
so here we want to start from the bottom

743
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
okay so these are ranked ordered from

744
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,720
the worst to the the most worst to the

745
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,799
least worst um so one that and again

746
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,480
this isn't super surprising but

747
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,600
strategic Clarity strategic

748
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,080
consistency uh prioritization like the

749
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,559
flip side of agility and Innovation the

750
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,559
kind of dark side of agility and

751
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,760
Innovation is if you're pivoting too

752
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,480
frequently which is in the eyes of

753
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,519
employees in these startups is a real

754
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,440
issue okay that the you know the

755
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:32,880
startups are just changing being too

756
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:35,000
fast um uh being overly agile in a sense

757
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,360
uh operating processes not surprising

758
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,200
you know more mature companies have more

759
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,039
defined operating processes job security

760
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,559
um again probably not super surprising

761
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:45,120
one thing again I didn't have a strong

762
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:48,039
prior on this one way or another but

763
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,039
that the data is pretty clear on is that

764
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,320
the characteristics there's a bundle of

765
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,320
characteristics uh that we classify as

766
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,799
toxic these are things that when when

767
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,399
employees talk about them they tend to

768
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,519
be very negative in their rating of a

769
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,480
company

770
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,799
uh it's abusive management lack of

771
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,480
respect lack of integrity and so forth

772
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,399
uh this bundle is more pronounced in a

773
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,559
negative sense in startups than it is in

774
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:15,080
established companies um so um again uh

775
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,519
you know it's not that these companies

776
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,639
are you know these Silicon Valley

777
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,080
startups are better at everything for

778
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:24,399
sure another interesting way to get at

779
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,240
this is a lot of times in these um uh in

780
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,919
these reviews employees will talk about

781
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,360
either their direct boss middle man

782
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,880
management are the top team they'll talk

783
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,000
about leaders uh and so another analysis

784
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,399
we're doing is how they talk about

785
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,679
leaders and the way silin Valley

786
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,720
startups talk about their leaders

787
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:42,720
positively the things that they are most

788
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,000
likely to be most positive about is that

789
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,919
they're accessible and transparent so

790
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,279
they you know they can understand what

791
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,720
the you know uh what's going on and um

792
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,799
that their intelligent against comes

793
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,639
back to this uh uh Talent density

794
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,639
argument that they're supportive and

795
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:01,080
they're committed to the or organization

796
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:05,080
rather than you know kind of checked

797
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,000
out um the things that employees are

798
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,919
most likely to be negative about when

799
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,279
talking about their leaders are um that

800
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,000
they're emotionally stable I thought

801
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,480
that's an interesting one that they're

802
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,399
you know like these are very folks that

803
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,039
are prone to ups and downs in the eyes

804
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:25,080
of their employees um uh not

805
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:26,519
particularly humble okay qualified is an

806
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,000
interesting one qualified and

807
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,600
intelligent are different qualified as

808
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,039
often like technical expertise in the

809
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,519
domain versus just raw horsepower um uh

810
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,360
not viewed as trustworthy um decisive

811
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,480
which again comes back to I think this

812
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,039
difficulty in prioritizing and um and

813
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,120
not pivoting too frequently uh and then

814
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,480
we see some traits that are again

815
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,360
associated with uh uh employees

816
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,399
perception of more toxic culture that

817
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:58,559
it's uh you know fear-based or uh or

818
00:32:52,399 --> 00:33:00,840
abusive um so um yeah so anyway as again

819
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,240
preliminary results but it it really

820
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,399
illustrates the power of applying AI to

821
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,080
textual data to start to characterize in

822
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,679
a granular and evidence-based way the

823
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,679
attributes of a culture of an

824
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,039
organization that opens up a whole lot

825
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,360
of very interesting um uh research

826
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,799
opportunities that we're pursuing I I'll

827
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,559
just cite here we at the Mi we've just

828
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:27,440
launched a series called culture

829
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:29,480
Champions um here at at MIT um that's

830
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,519
published at MIT slow management review

831
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,880
it's outside the pay wall um and what it

832
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,600
does is we um we use empirical data to

833
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,399
identify companies whose cultures are

834
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,399
both at least 1.5 standard deviations

835
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:45,559
above their industry mean for how

836
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,480
employees talk about the culture and at

837
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,080
least 1.5 standard deviations above

838
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,440
their industry mean in terms of total

839
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,840
shareholder returns or proxies for

840
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,559
private companies so we're looking at

841
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,080
those companies that manage to create

842
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,000
cultures that both deliver uh strong

843
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,279
results and uh provide a good employee

844
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,440
experience and trying to understand uh

845
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:09,399
through a systematic interview protocol

846
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,960
what are um uh you know what what those

847
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:12,159
companies do differently what the

848
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,919
Tactical things those companies do

849
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,520
differently we have a

850
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,440
podcast uh but then we also have like

851
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,520
for each of the each of the guests we

852
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,679
have an um you know an interview that we

853
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,159
summarize some of the key thoughts and

854
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,800
again all that is you know free and uh

855
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:30,919
at the MIT St management review site

856
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,280
uh so that's it for me and and that's my

857
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:35,240
email up there too if you are interested

858
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,520
in this

859
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,599
stuff thank you so much Don it's a great

860
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,079
talk very very very interesting we have

861
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,320
a couple minutes for questions if you're

862
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,720
okay with that sure uh the top question

863
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,800
we have is how do you navigate the SE

864
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,560
Suite resistance to datadriven versus

865
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,000
carefully crafted

866
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,000
survey

867
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
um uh

868
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,040
s i I guess I'm not sure I'm

869
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,920
understanding well I'll take the bit of

870
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,440
it that I I'll answer the question that

871
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,599
I want to answer so how do you I I'll

872
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,040
I'll focus on the first part of the

873
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,160
question is how do you navigate seite

874
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,000
resistance to data uh which is something

875
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,720
I spend especially my startups spend a

876
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:22,560
lot of time with um I think you know one

877
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,560
is um what we typically find when we're

878
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,200
dealing with top teams on this issue of

879
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,560
culture in particular is first

880
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,000
gauging the top team's commitment to

881
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,880
culture and so there's a lot of

882
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,200
heterogeneity there are some top teams

883
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,880
who just viscerally even without

884
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,440
evidence believe culture matters and

885
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,760
there are others who are extremely

886
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,880
skeptical and there are lots who are in

887
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,680
the middle the ones who are extremely

888
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,119
skeptical don't bother I I mean no date

889
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,920
is going to change their mind and I

890
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,040
don't know what 10% 20% I don't know

891
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,119
what it is but there's some there's some

892
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,880
tale where they just think it's nonsense

893
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,440
and they're going to be hard to convince

894
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,160
the ones who are already convinced you

895
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,440
don't have to do much convin the

896
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,839
interesting group is the group in the

897
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,319
middle that doesn't have you know they

898
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,319
and often what we find there is you know

899
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:10,760
they're used to the reports they get

900
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:12,599
from their CFO or their CTO or their coo

901
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,800
where it's like good data and solid

902
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,119
analysis and objective data and

903
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,520
Benchmark properly and that's how they

904
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,280
kind of set their bar for um uh

905
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,599
assessing confidence in the data source

906
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,640
they get and then no offense to any HR

907
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,160
folks in the room HR comes in and starts

908
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,119
like reading po or something and and

909
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,880
understandably leaders

910
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,000
are you know tend to Discount that data

911
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,520
so I think a big part of it is showing

912
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that there is a method you can bring the

913
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,599
the same level of methodological rigor

914
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,800
to analyzing culture that you can to

915
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,280
analyzing you know your inventory turns

916
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,480
or you know uh customer feedback and

917
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,319
then once you do that in my experience

918
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,880
at least it's been the case that those

919
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:58,839
those leaders in the middle are much

920
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,599
more susceptible to um you know to to

921
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,240
taking culture seriously the other thing

922
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:06,599
is you have to be super super careful

923
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,400
about um um you know one of the

924
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,680
challenges of providing people with data

925
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,680
is that sometimes it doesn't say what

926
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,400
they want to say uh they don't want it

927
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,400
to say and these can be quite sensitive

928
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,640
issues so I was just on the phone with

929
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:22,400
the CEO of a um a very large asset

930
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,520
management firm who it their culture is

931
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,640
very toxic and it's demonstrably so you

932
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,079
know multiple data sources two to three

933
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,680
standard deviations above the industry

934
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,960
mean and already it's in an industry

935
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,839
that is not you know like really touchy

936
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,280
feely industry to begin with so um and

937
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,599
you know in that case it's like anytime

938
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,079
you're you all know this you're

939
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,280
delivering bad news you start with the

940
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,920
good news and you know here are some

941
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,400
things you're doing really well on and

942
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,960
there are one or two problems we should

943
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,480
probably talk about and um you don't you

944
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,720
don't lead with the fact that you know

945
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,079
you guys should be in prison the way you

946
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,000

947
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,200
