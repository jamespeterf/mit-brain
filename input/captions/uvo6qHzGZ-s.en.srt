1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,759
it's great to be here everyone I am Sid

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,640
probstein I am the Creator uh of swirl

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,519
and the CEO of swirl corporation which

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,799
uh promotes and uh is expanding it into

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,799
the Enterprise I've been lucky to work

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,480
in search a few times previously at

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,760
companies like um an tibio now better

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,320
known as service now uh but in

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,560
particular I'm focused on the scavenger

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,000
hunt and our team is obsessed with

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,359
ending the scavenger hunt you know what

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,800
the scavenger hunt is it's the less fun

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,640
version of the thing we've sometimes

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,920
done at birthdays or or at parties uh

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,079
and it's particularly impactful for

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,559
employees in the Enterprise where they

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,680
have many silos they go from tab to tab

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,480
logging in Remembering how to use the

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,879
search engine uh or query system writing

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,399
queries downloading documents and AI

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,079
seems like it should be the perfect

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,239
answer but yet there's a

23
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,359
problem the problem is AI Solutions

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,680
especially this first generation require

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,000
you to copy data into them they're like

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,199
databases your information goes in and

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,080
you get insight out that can be

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,400
problematic in when you have complex

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,320
security across multiple silos uh

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,799
compliance issues in regulated markets

31
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,600
such as sharing a departmental owned

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,960
resource with a corporate owned resource

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,640
or simply verifying that a third party

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,360
is okay to hold your data when your uh

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,119
information in landscape looks a little

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,360
bit like this uh the cost of duplicating

37
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,520
data becomes hugely problematic and

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,479
ultimately it requires you to have a lot

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,399
of Technical and security capability not

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,079
every organization is 100% ready to just

41
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,680
do those things and so that's why you

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,560
see so many articles about the adoption

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,560
of AI being slow or challenging swirl is

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,439
different swirl is software you deploy

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,240
anywhere in your environment in your

46
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,280
subscription on your Edge it's 100%

47
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,640
containerized so information never

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
leaves your environment or control and

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,119
that's really a key compliance issue

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
another one is swirl uses a zero trust

51
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,039
model there's no way to add documents to

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,360
swirl it doesn't accept them there's no

53
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,320
indexing it integrates with single sign

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,280
on and so it's able to talk to the silos

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,720
exactly the way the user does in fact it

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,000
does so on their behalf creating a very

57
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,239
personal view when swirl searches or

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,239
generates an AI Insight uh the way you

59
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,879
would sort of creating a chat GPT for

60
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,400
your data it's your outlook your one

61
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,080
drive your email your calendar your

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
files now sometimes people say well okay

63
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,400
what does that sort of end up looking

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,440
like well here's a convers a with your

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
data here's one that I have uh had

66
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,519
recently how much cyber Insurance do we

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,239
have as a company I'm the person

68
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,720
responsible I bought the policy and I

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,120
dropped it in one drive as one does I

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,440
don't remember exactly what's covered

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,360
now swirl turns any llm or gai that's

72
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,120
sufficiently capable into a powerful

73
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Search Assistant we show it what the

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,720
user is authorized to see so when I

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,800
suggest I'm looking for a policy of our

76
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,319
companies it comes right back and says

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,280
that might well be in one drive or

78
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,400
SharePoint I confirm that and I get the

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,000
answer in less than a minute that saved

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,640
me at least five more five to 10 minutes

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
because it's about a 50-page policy

82
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,040
there's also a second document that I

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,159
would need to gather it's referenced

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,680
here actually because in addition to the

85
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,959
Insight I have citations I can click

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,200
those links and verify that this is all

87
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,599
correct and of course that's part of

88
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,440
building a trusted AI solution you have

89
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,560
to be able to verify the

90
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,319
information it's not just for Content

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,439
though swirls Works amazing amazingly

92
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,920
well and transforms that Search

93
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,000
Assistant into someone who can help you

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,519
navigate structured data uh ever come to

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,439
a new job flipped open your new laptop

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,920
and found 50 icons sure we can

97
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,080
understand what's under chat or email

98
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,439
but what's under powerbi or Tableau or

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
some other business intelligence or

100
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,959
reporting tool there could be anything

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,799
there thrl can generate answers to

102
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,280
structured data questions like how much

103
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,879
did we ship or how much did someone

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,920
raise what categories have been raising

105
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,000
recently even visualize it but

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,040
ultimately you can click the link and go

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,920
right into the

108
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,239
silo srl's secret secret special power

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,879
is

110
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,439
reranking swirl gets the results by

111
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,280
using search apis or query apis and then

112
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,479
figures out using Vector analysis and

113
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,560
large language models what's the best

114
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,759
result for the user's query it's

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,080
contextual and has that uncanny human

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,919
feeling that you get when you're talking

117
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,720
to chat GPT so here you can see swirl

118
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,160
reranking Google's results you search

119
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,199
for red hat acquires you can do this

120
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,199
right now most of the results will come

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,560
back about red hat being acquired by IBM

122
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,720
if you use swirl which by the way you

123
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,720
can get running with two lines and

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,680
Docker in one minute uh you'd rerank

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,759
that result set and find all of the red

126
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,240
hat Acquisitions or even purchases

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,440
because it knows that those words mean

128
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,199
the same thing it works amazingly well

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,360
on box.com and many many other search

130
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,479
engines uh here we find the search term

131
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,560
in the title and boost it up from result

132
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,039
two to result number

133
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,080
one swirl can do this kind of

134
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,120
conversation and search and reranking

135
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,759
using any of the AIS or llms in the

136
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,600
left-hand column and generate insights

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,320
from the data platforms Enterprise

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,800
applications and web services you see

139
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,520
here leaders like mongodb Google big

140
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,800
query or snowflake uh Enterprise

141
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,440
applications obviously M365 but also

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,560
other popular ones like Salesforce

143
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,600
service now slack and

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,759
atlassian and what are the benefits of

145
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,199
deploying swirl while a global life

146
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,720
sciences firm studied their supply chain

147
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,600
team they were um struggling with

148
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,759
information overload too many reports

149
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,280
and different dashboards to use they had

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,919
a data science team on call effectively

151
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,319
through a ticket system with a two week

152
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,919
SLA and they had the highest cost to

153
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,600
answer questions and significant burnout

154
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,960
in the team due to the problem of having

155
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,520
to ask over and over again with swil

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,680
they s switched 100% to a self-service

157
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,720
model and they saved 7 and a half hours

158
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,199
per employee per week that's their own

159
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,520
study in particular 4 hours with the

160
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,960
navigation problem you can see in the

161
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,680
lower right hand corner we've also help

162
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,319
solve these kinds of problems for secure

163
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,639
Services firms where critical help desk

164
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
information needs to be brought together

165
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,520
without actually merging the data and a

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
national technology service provider

167
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,120
that's um solving uh incoming requests

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,080
from prospects uh in less than a few

169
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,319
minutes uh with very high accuracy and

170
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,639
ultimately taking the humans out of the

171
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,599
loop and letting them focus on um the

172
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,400
exceptional cases right when one of the

173
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,720
great things about swirl is when an AI

174
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,240
isn't confident we can flag that and uh

175
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,080
cue it for review human review we are

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,319
here looking for Enterprise uh proof of

177
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,680
value opportunities for teams of

178
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,160
Departments of around 50 employees

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,120
particularly if they're reporting on and

180
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,520
or making decisions using documents and

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,360
databases from multiple silos especially

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,520
in regulated Industries some of the use

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,919
cases you see here uh supply chain I

184
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,840
already mentioned uh lending is a big

185
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,160
one and leasing a wash in documents that

186
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,639
are typically not in data models with

187
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,840
the goal of increasing productivity

188
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,599
reducing decision time uh eliminating

189
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,000
information gaps and also increasing

190
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,000
customer

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
satisfaction so I'll just pause here

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
love to take some questions I hope that

193
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,440
uh all made

194
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,120
sense thanks SED um good examples um and

195
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,039
um I think a variety of sectors that

196
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,560
hopefully people can see um their

197
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,319
applications so um a question about

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,599
privacy which is so important tell us a

199
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,360
little more about that so I think it's

200
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,160
been it's been written about a lot that

201
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,680
privacy um is one of the biggest

202
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,840
barriers to adopting AI swirl is is

203
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,960
software deployed in your own

204
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,280
environment it's not a SAS we can host

205
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,360
it for you if you like for some

206
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,479
applications we're happy to do so but

207
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,639
when you're deploying it and it's going

208
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,840
to have access to um employee pii and

209
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,800
potentially other sensitive information

210
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,960
it stays in your own environment your

211
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,000
your corporate environment so it's never

212
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,840
leaving your firewall so to speak that

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
term is not totally correct these days

214
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,879
but anyway let's call it the perimeter

215
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,159
and um as a result it's under the same

216
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,599
controls that the current employee is uh

217
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,080
data is so that's really compliant and

218
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,599
be much more reassuring to um employees

219
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
who might otherwise worry that you know

220
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
their internal Communications are being

221
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,000
shared with a third

222
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,400
party great and um which areas within a

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,560
company um are do you tend to work with

224
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,360
and um what's the um process for like

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,440
user interface and um and things like

226
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,159
that oh great great great question uh so

227
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,000
ultimately we work with folks who have

228
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:30,039
documents and databases supply chain is

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,080
a very common one uh status report

230
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,519
analysts are very common research teams

231
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,880
um R&D teams particularly uh both on the

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,120
dev side we have lots of folks who use

233
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,120
us to look across multiple

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,680
githubsign with the apis first you can

235
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:02,360
uh assemble a variety of different

236
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,640
widgets and interfaces you can deploy on

237
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,560
your existing

238
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,560
applications okay thank you
