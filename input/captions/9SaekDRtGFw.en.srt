five, prototype problems, not products.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
No one likes uncertainty. If you're

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,439
innovating, that's all you have. Think

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,840
about it. You're tackling a problem no

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,240
one has before. without a ready-made

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,560
problem statement, with a technology no

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,720
one has used quite that way before and

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,559
you're working off a hunch. Really, all

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
you have is uncertainty. I am using the

11
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,559
word hunch because it's the best word in

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,000
the English language to describe the

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,719
state of your idea at the very start.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,879
When you start, that idea isn't really

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,280
fleshed out. At best, it's something

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,719
exciting you want to work on, but you

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
know you need to flesh it out before you

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
can even work on it. And so instead of

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
talking about ideas and putting all

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,079
those attributes and ideas as scalable,

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,520
disruptive, and what not, I invite you

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,160
to think of everything you're thinking

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,680
about at the start as a hunch, something

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,760
that should get you excited for what

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
comes next, as opposed to stressed out

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,680
for how big or disruptive it needs to

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
be. The only way to move forward is to

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,439
get real. The sooner the better, so you

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
can get on with the job, which I told

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
you already, is fixing what's wrong

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,479
about your idea. You start by

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,720
prototyping the problem. Yes, the

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,280
problem. You may be tempted to start

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,960
prototyping some product or the pitch.

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
But if a user, the product and the

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,159
solution are known, then someone else

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,640
must have worked out the problem for you

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
like in math class. That's how much we

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
dislike uncertainty. This is how it

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,600
typically goes. You end up taking a

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,280
gamble on the solution you imagined and

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
stop paying attention to the problem.

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
You leave no room for being wrong. And

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,880
by the time you discover how you were

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,320
wrong, failing is the only viable option

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,479
you have left. In 2013, in an interview

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,799
with National Public Radio, Chris

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
Hatfield, the Canadian astronaut,

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,360
described how astronauts prepare for a

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,040
mission to the space station in a way

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
that I believe captures the difference

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,680
between prototyping a problem and

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,240
focusing on the solution.

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,759
Half of the risk of a six-month flight

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,160
is in the first 9 minutes. So, as a

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,760
crew, how do you stay focused and how do

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,879
you not get u paralyzed by the fear of

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,599
it? And the way we do it is to break

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,760
down what are the risks. And a nice way

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,840
to keep reminding yourself is what's the

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,680
next thing that's going to kill me? And

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
it might be 5 seconds away. It might be

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,160
an inadvertent engine shutdown or it

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,239
might be uh staging of the solid rockets

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,959
coming off or it might be you know some

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
transition or or or some some key next

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
thing. We've already say had one

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
computer fail and we've had one

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,680
hydraulic system fail. So if these three

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,280
things fail now we're you know we need

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,760
to react right away or we're done. So we

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
don't just live with that though. And

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
and the thing that is really useful I

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,040
think out of all this is we dig into it

75
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,480
so deeply and we look at okay so this

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
might kill us. This is something that

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,680
would normally panic us. Let's get

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,560
ready. Let's think about it and we go

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,480
into every excruciating detail of why

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
that might affect what we're doing and

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
what we can do to resolve it and have a

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
plan and be comfortable with it and

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,440
practice it. In this interview,

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,080
astronaut Chris Hatfield is talking

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
about focusing on the problem. To them,

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,560
that's going to the space station and

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,319
making it back to Earth. And the way

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
they do it is by discovering what might

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,560
go wrong and finding ways to fix it in

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,959
the rocket, through practice, or

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
whatever. When the mission starts, they

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,080
are prepared for everything they

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
foresaw, and they're ready to handle

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
many things they could not have

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
predicted.

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
That is what I mean by prototyping the

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,319
problem.

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
When you prototype the problem, your

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,280
goal is to make the problem tangible

100
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,720
enough for you and others. The more

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
tangible your description of the

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,159
problem, the easier it will be for you

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,879
and them to see ways to solve the

104
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,640
problem. In contrast, prototyping a

105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,799
madeup solution for a problem you do not

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,120
understand is like putting the carriage

107
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
before the horse. You do not want to

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
wait until launch day to see if you're

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,760
working on the problem. If you do,

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,080
you'll miss out on everything that's not

111
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
captured by what you imagined to be the

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
solution. It would be as if the

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
astronauts had picked ahead of time the

114
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,720
one thing that might go wrong and

115
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,760
prepared only for that. There's more I

116
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,519
would like to tell you about how to

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,079
prototype the problem. I am also aware

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
old habits die hard. You can find out

119
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,919
about more strategies in my book,

120
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Innovating Adors Manifesto or in the

121
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,520
many materials I've shared online. For

122
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,320
now, let me just give you a tip for how

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,320
to get started. This is how you can

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,160
start practicing.

125
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
Come up with three solutions to the

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,320
problem.

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Prototype all three. Then ask yourself

128
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,160
or someone else the following two

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,639
questions. Are these three solutions

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
sufficiently different? And how would

131
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
you know either of them actually solves

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,759
the problem?

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
Once you start getting real, you realize

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,920
there's multiple ways to chip at the

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:56,680
problem and have an impact.
