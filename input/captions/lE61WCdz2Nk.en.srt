hi I'm here to talk to you about

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,720
becoming a superhuman that needs less or

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,440
little oxygen our cells in our body use

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,400
oxygen to produce energy they burn sugar

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,880
glucose with oxygen and produce all the

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,480
energy that your cell needs and in the

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,520
end it produces water and CO2 in this

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,279
process so you wouldn't be able to burn

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
glucose and sugar effectively if you

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,840
switched out oxygen for anything else

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,080
however it might be possible to get rid

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,599
of our need for so much oxygen there's

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,720
this amazing protein in your blood

14
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,039
called hemoglobin hemoglobin picks up

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,000
oxygen in your lungs and carries it

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,600
through your bloodstream to your cells

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,200
uh and drops it off scientists have

18
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,239
already observed different forms of of

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,640
hemoglobin that bind oxygen differently

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,160
in different environments and so we

21
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,160
could probably figure out ways of

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,960
changing hemoglobin to bind oxygen more

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,320
strongly so maybe if you're on a newly

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,520
terraformed Planet maybe you'd want

25
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,559
hemoglobin that could bind oxygen more

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,239
strongly and really make do with the

27
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,520
oxygen that you have available in your

28
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,960
lungs for more MIT moments from MIT open
