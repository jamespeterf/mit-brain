1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,960
Thank you so much. Welcome to 61200,

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,880
6120, I don't know how you want to

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,359
pronounce it. Anything goes. Either way,

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,680
welcome. Um, really looking forward to a

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,920
great semester with all of you. So, a

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,320
couple a couple salient points.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,800
structure-wise, schedule-wise, um we

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,800
have lectures on Tuesday, Thursday, 2:30

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,360
to 4, which I suppose you know if you're

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,079
here in person, uh we have recitations

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,840
on Wednesdays and Fridays. Uh we do take

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
attendance at recitations. It's worth

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,120
10% of your grade. So, we highly

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,719
recommend that you go both for your

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,239
grade and also it's some of the most

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,719
useful time that you'll have this

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,280
semester. Um you'll be working with your

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,200
peers to solve problems in small groups.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,840
You'll have a TA there to offer advice

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,039
and suggestions. Uh it's really valuable

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,440
time. Um and I highly recommend you go.

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
I guarantee you'll get a lot out of it.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,960
Um

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,199
since it's such a valuable time and such

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,320
a limited resource, just two hours per

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,240
week. Um we have what we call warm-up

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,560
problems, which are just quick

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,360
multiplechoice problems right there on

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
Canvas um to get you thinking about the

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
lecture material a little bit. They're

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,320
not meant to be hard. They're not meant

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,920
to be stressful. Um, but we do want you

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
to think about the problems a little bit

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
and answer them and get the answers

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
right. Um, getting the answer right is

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
not as strenuous as it sounds because

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,159
you get infinite retries and instant

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,079
feedback up until the deadline. As so as

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,799
long as you remember to do it, you're

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,920
going to get full points. Um, you could

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,520
if you want just option A, click, nope,

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
that's wrong. Option B, click, nope,

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,920
that's wrong. Option C. We don't

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,360
recommend that. Ideally, it's in your

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,799
favor to actually think about the

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
problem a little bit. might even be a

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
little faster. But the point is to be a

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
reminder to think about the lecture

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
material a little bit before you come to

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
recitation. What we want to avoid is

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
everyone shows up to recitation and

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,079
says, "Wait, what are we covering today?

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,439
I don't even know. I wasn't able to go

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,080
to lecture. I don't know what was

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,160
covered. Can someone fill me in?" Um, I

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
would prefer that we that we do the

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
catching up before recitation. So, by

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
the time we get there, we know what

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
we're going to talk about. We can ask

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,879
any questions we have. we can start

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,760
working on the problems and use that

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,840
time as productively as possible.

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,680
Um, so that's recitations and warm-ups.

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,239
We have problem sets. We'll have weekly

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,720
problem sets due on Monday nights. I

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,720
hope everyone turned it in yesterday.

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
Um, they'll be released on Tuesdays. Oh,

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
I got a thumbs up. Where did you send

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,640
that?

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,800
Um, we'll release problem sets Tuesdays.

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,440
They'll be due on Monday nights 11:59

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,400
p.m. Uh, so as Monday night as we can

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,560
get. Um,

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
and I want to say a few words about

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
these problem sets, uh, about the

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
structure and about the collaboration.

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
We want you to collaborate. We want you

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to work with your peers. We want you to

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
get help from us in office hours and on

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,280
piaza and things like that. We want you

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,239
to solve these problem sets

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,319
collaboratively if you so choose. Um, we

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,640
do have we are signed up for pet

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,360
partners. So once a week, shortly after

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,920
the problem sets go out, um the pizza

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
partner site will match you with other

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,200
problem set solvers that have similar

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,560
schedules. So if you want to find a

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
group that way, you're more than welcome

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
to. We'll set it to go off a couple days

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
after each problem set releases. So just

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,319
be sure to sign up on time. If you miss

93
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,720
the first round, you can sign up in the

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,480
second round. Or you can come to office

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,760
hours and find friends there. You can

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
work with friends at your dorm. However

97
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,599
you want to find partners, go ahead and

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,440
do it if you want. And we encourage you

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,440
to solve these problems correctly.

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,480
Sorry, collaboratively also correctly,

101
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,040
you know. Um, not the worst Freudian

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,799
slip. Um, we encourage you to solve

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,480
collaboratively. Figure things out. Some

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
of these problems are challenging. Some

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480
of them have tricks that you're you

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,440
might not see immediately and you have

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,760
to figure out what's going on. However,

108
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,760
there's a second step to this to the

109
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,280
problem set process that I want to call

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
attention to, and that's the writing

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,400
step. One of the main goals of this

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
course, one of the main exports for this

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,400
course is proof writing. The ability to

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,040
write precise, concise, correct

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
mathematical arguments. And that is a

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
skill that we will be practicing and

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
developing all semester.

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,479
And everyone has a slightly different

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,040
style. Everyone thinks about these

120
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,360
things differently. Uh, and the act of

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,520
just constructing a proof, even if it

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,400
all makes perfect sense in your head,

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,040
the act of translating that into a proof

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,840
on paper that's able to be read and

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,240
consumed and believed by others is its

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,800
own special skill. And we want you to

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,840
get lots of practice with that. Keyword

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
being you, not your group. So, go ahead

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,120
and solve the problems collaboratively.

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
Whatever notes you've generated, that's

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
fine. Keep them, study from them. But

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
when you're going to write your problem

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,720
set, put those notes aside, please, and

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,040
piece things together yourself in your

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,840
words, showing your understanding. So

136
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,560
solve together, write alone. Just to

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,880
emphasize this one more time, the reason

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm spending all this time belaboring

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,240
this point is something I like to call

140
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,919
the P versus NP fallacy, which just says

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,479
that reading and understanding someone

142
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,560
else's proof is easier than constructing

143
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,320
that proof yourself.

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
And it's really tempting to think that

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,160
these two tasks are equivalent. Like

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,080
when you're studying for a test, you

147
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
read through our problem set solutions

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,639
like, "Yeah, that makes sense. That

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
makes sense. That makes sense. Great.

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm convinced that doesn't immediately

151
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,240
translate to I therefore could have put

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,400
it together myself.

153
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
So understanding a proof and writing a

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,960
proof, two different skills. We want you

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,039
to get practice with both. Any questions

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,919
about that? About the intent behind our

157
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,840
collaboration policy.

158
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,880
Awesome.

159
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,960
Um let's see. Late problem sets. Last

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,280
thing I want to talk about, we do accept

161
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,479
late problem sets. We accept very late

162
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,720
problem sets. Um so we put a lot of

163
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,400
effort into making these problem sets at

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,199
least trying to make these problem sets

165
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
both interesting and useful. And so we

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,080
want to incentivize all of you to work

167
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,720
the problem sets as much as you can um

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,280
in as many ways as you can even if that

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
means it's late. If the schedule doesn't

170
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,960
line up you had to miss some problem

171
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,720
sets. We want you to be able to catch up

172
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,800
by doing the problem sets. So, we allow

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,199
late problem sets up to and including

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,039
the last day of classes.

175
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,960
Um, if you forget to do problem set one

176
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,720
and you you remember, oh, in the last

177
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
week, maybe I should go back and and

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,400
solve those problems.

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
Probably would have been more useful to

180
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,639
do it before the first quiz, but you

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
know, better late than never. Um, you

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,840
can still turn in that problem set late

183
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,919
for half credit. More precisely, our

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,280
late problem set policy is that for the

185
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,800
first 50 hours, um the late penalty or

186
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,120
the percentage of points that you will

187
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,160
earn from your submission goes from 100%

188
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,360
if it's on time down to 50% if it's 50

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,120
hours late and 1% each hour for those

190
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
first 50 hours, those first two-ish

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,720
days. And then after that, it stays at

192
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,720
50 for the rest of term. Uh that also

193
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,639
means that if you're if it's 11:45

194
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,560
and you have one problem left, you you

195
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,960
know how to do it, you just down to the

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,360
wire for writing it down or you want to

197
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,599
take another hour or 30 minutes or

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
something to think about that problem.

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,680
Go ahead and be a little late. It's not

200
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,520
a big deal. If you're 1 hour late,

201
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,360
you're still going to get 99% of the

202
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,000
points that you would have otherwise.

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,039
It's worth it to take that extra time.

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,120
It means that there there isn't a sharp

205
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,160
cut off between before the deadline and

206
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,759
after the deadline. It's not a big deal.

207
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,080
Don't worry about it. We want to reduce

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,720
stress for everyone involved. Any

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,720
questions about that?

210
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,160
Excellent. All right. Like I said, lots

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
more details there on the course

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,080
information policies um PDF on our

213
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,240
Canvas site. And with that, let's let's

214
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,639
talk about some math.

215
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,000
So, as I said earlier, the one of the

216
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,400
main skills and tools that we want you

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,560
to have coming out of this class is the

218
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,120
ability to write proofs and read proofs

219
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
and evaluate proofs. Um, as one of my

220
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,800
colleagues says, this class could have

221
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,199
been called proofs, proofs, and more

222
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,759
proofs. We're going to talk about proofs

223
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,279
a lot, especially today where we're

224
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,560
going to start with what is a proof?

225
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,120
And I'm going to write that down because

226
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,800
it's important enough. What

227
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,719
is a proof?

228
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,480
And I'm going to give a starting answer

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
and we're going to elaborate on this a

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
little bit. Here's uh question and

231
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,959
answer.

232
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,959
It's a method

233
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,360
of ascertaining truth.

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,600
A proof is how you show that something

235
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,600
is true.

236
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,320
And we as a society have lots and lots

237
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,920
of methods for determining what's true.

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Uh I'm going to give you a couple. For

239
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,160
example, we have uh we have experiments

240
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,040
and observation and the scientific

241
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,920
method. Um that is how we determine

242
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,880
what's true in the physical sciences. Uh

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,880
we have sampling.

244
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,800
If you want to know who's likely to win

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,040
an election, you pick a random sample

246
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,920
and you ask who they're going to vote

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,320
for and you generalize.

248
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,560
Um, we have legal proceedings.

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,920
You hold a trial. Huh, two different

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,920
L's. Who knew? Uh, you hold a trial to

251
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,880
determine what happened and who's

252
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,279
culpable. That is how we determine truth

253
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,480
in those cases. Who can give me some

254
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,480
others? How do we determine truth?

255
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,680
Yes.

256
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,120
Investigation.

257
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,399
All right. Yeah. Investigation.

258
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,880
Absolutely. Um

259
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,320
investigation.

260
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Looking for evidence. Um looking for the

261
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,880
the most likely explanation that fits

262
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,560
the observation. So actually pretty

263
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
similar to some of the other ones. Yes.

264
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,519
asking questions.

265
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,519
Asking questions. Absolutely. Um,

266
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,399
cool. Let me give you um a couple more.

267
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,399
Um,

268
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:48,120
authority. If your professor says this

269
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,120
is true, then it's true, right?

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,240
Please don't do that.

271
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Uh, we make mistakes all the time and we

272
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,519
want you to call us out on that.

273
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,519
Um we have religion.

274
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,800
This is what our religion says. This is

275
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,040
what our deity says. Therefore, it is

276
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
true and it is how I should um live my

277
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:17,720
life. These are the values I should

278
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,720
value. Um we have like inner conviction.

279
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,200
I just feel like it should be this way.

280
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,600
Like deep in my gut I know it's true. It

281
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,440
came to me in a dream.

282
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,320
Sometimes

283
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,480
that is how things work. Um so lots of

284
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,160
different ways of determining truth,

285
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,760
lots of different meanings of the word

286
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,600
truth in those situations. Um and as

287
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,640
mathematicians we have our own

288
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,680
procedures for determining truth. Um and

289
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,160
that is a mathematical proof.

290
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,160
So definition

291
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,279
A mathematical proof.

292
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,480
Is a verification of a proposition

293
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,519
by a chain of

294
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,519
logical deductions

295
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,000
from a base set of axioms.

296
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,639
A mathematical proof is a verification

297
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,600
of a proposition by a chain of logical

298
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,519
deductions from a base set of axioms.

299
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
And there are three terms inside of that

300
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,440
definition that we're going to focus on

301
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
today and tomorrow. We'll break them

302
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,519
down one at a time and hopefully make

303
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:05,880
this make more sense. Let's start with

304
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,880
proposition. What is a proposition?

305
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Definition.

306
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,079
A proposition is a statement

307
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,600
That is true.

308
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,600
Oops. Or false.

309
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,880
Today is Tuesday. Proposition.

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,959
Yeah, it's Oh, that is true. Yeah. Okay.

311
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,639
Um, today is Thursday. Proposition.

312
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,160
Yeah, it's false, but it's still a

313
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,620
proposition.

314
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,680
Um,

315
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:52,480
[Applause]

316
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,639
let's see examples. 2 + 3 = 5.

317
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,839
Yeah, proposition.

318
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,000
2 + 3 = 4.

319
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,000
Still a proposition.

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Here's one.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:14,199
For all n in the natural numbers,

322
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,199
n^2 + n + 41 is prime.

323
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,839
This is new notation. Let's break it

324
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,920
down. This says

325
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,160
for all. So for every n that is in the

326
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,360
natural numbers, this what's called

327
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,360
blackboard bold capital N is the natural

328
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,360
numbers.

329
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Also known as the set zero, 1 2 3

330
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,320
and all the way up. starts at zero,

331
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,760
starts counting upwards. Um, outside of

332
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,600
this class, you might see um people

333
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,360
trying to convince you that zero is not

334
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,199
a natural number. Uh, they're wrong. At

335
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
least for the purposes of this class, 0

336
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,040
is always a natural number.

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,079
Um, all right. So, every natural number

338
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,560
for every natural number n, n^2 + n is

339
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,279
plus 41 is prime. Is this

340
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,160
a proposition?

341
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,399
Yeah, it's a statement where it at least

342
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,560
makes sense to ask is this true or

343
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,120
false.

344
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,480
There's a related concept by the way. So

345
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,360
this thing in here just n^2 + n + 41 is

346
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,360
prime. Is that a proposition?

347
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,120
Let me give a an even easier example.

348
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,270
Um oh my examples were already on that

349
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,590
board. Um, sorry.

350
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,590
[Applause]

351
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Even easier example. P is prime.

352
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,839
Is that a proposition?

353
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm seeing some thumbs down. I'm seeing

354
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,759
some thumbs down. Yeah, it's not a

355
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,160
proposition.

356
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,360
Not a proposition.

357
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,279
Because it's sort of incomplete

358
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,839
information. What P are we talking

359
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,240
about? If you tell me a P is seven

360
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,720
prime, that's a proposition. Is 12

361
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
prime, that's a proposition. So this is

362
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,639
sort of a proposition with a variable

363
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,880
that we need to fill in before it

364
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:21,240
becomes a proposition. This is what's

365
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,240
called a predicate. This is a predicate.

366
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,519
And I was bringing back the old board so

367
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,519
I could write down that definition.

368
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,519
A predicate

369
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,160
is a proposition

370
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,120
whose truth depends

371
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,120
on variables.

372
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,519
So it's sort of a parameterized

373
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,959
proposition. Once you tell me what the

374
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:03,199
variables are, then it's a proposition.

375
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,640
And we just saw an example up here.

376
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,360
I hope no one's getting dizzy from all

377
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,520
the boards moving around.

378
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,520
We just saw an example here where this

379
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,039
inside

380
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,039
is a predicate that depends on n. And

381
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,400
this for all is able to take that

382
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,439
predicate depending on n and wrap it up

383
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,000
into what is now a proposition. It says

384
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,240
that this predicate about n needs to be

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,840
true for every natural number. And now

386
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,559
it's a proposition. It's either true or

387
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,640
false.

388
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,320
Is it true or false? Let's see if we can

389
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,080
figure it out. We know it's a

390
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,000
proposition, but is it true? Is it

391
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,160
false? Um, well, let's let's do the

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,320
natural thing and try some examples.

393
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,960
Okay. Well, here's n here's n ^2 + n +

394
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,640
41. Is it prime?

395
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,440
Great. So, natural numbers, remember,

396
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:02,160
start at zero. So when n is zero, this

397
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:06,000
is 41. Absolutely prime. When n is one,

398
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:10,160
this is 43. Still prime. Looking good so

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,360
far. How about two? I think we get 47.

400
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,840
Also prime. And if you check 3, four,

401
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,360
five, six, prime, prime, prime, prime.

402
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:24,000
It keeps being prime. Um, what if we go

403
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,480
all the way up to like 39? We get 161.

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
If my notes are to be believed, which is

405
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
also prime,

406
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,679
this is looking pretty convincing,

407
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,760
right? There we go.

408
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,880
And in some fields of study, just doing

409
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,880
a sufficient number of examples would be

410
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
enough evidence for it to be true or

411
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,679
effectively true or as good as true.

412
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,520
Unfortunately, for us mathematicians, if

413
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:53,760
we say for all n, we need all of the n,

414
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,520
just these 40 examples isn't enough.

415
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,200
Um,

416
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,960
and of course, if you go one more,

417
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,080
um, did I write this down? Oh, here.

418
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's jump to 41. 41 looks like a good

419
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,480
example cuz that's going to be a

420
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,520
multiple of 41. Multiple of 41. Multiple

421
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:18,400
of 41. Uh, turns out what you get is

422
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,679
41 time 43,

423
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,240
which is not prime.

424
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,840
And so we found an example where this is

425
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,160
not prime and therefore this proposition

426
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,160
is false.

427
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,440
If it's supposed to be true for every

428
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,840
natural number to disprove it, all we

429
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,320
need to find is a single counter

430
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,280
example, a single number n that doesn't

431
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,200
satisfy the required conditions. Does

432
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,840
that make sense?

433
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,080
Cool. Turns out if you go to 40, I'm

434
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,600
pretty sure you get 41 squared, which is

435
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,919
also not prime. Um, so 0 through 39 are

436
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,160
are really um the most you're going to

437
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,640
get in that run.

438
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,240
All right, let's look at another example

439
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,240
of a of a fun proposition

440
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,960
just to get more familiar with this.

441
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,960
Let's see. Goldbox conjecture.

442
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,520
Let's see.

443
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,160
Every

444
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,240
even

445
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,240
number greater than two

446
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,360
is the sum of two primes.

447
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
Every even number greater than two is a

448
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,039
sum of two primes. For example, can we

449
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,039
do 12?

450
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,600
Who can tell me? Um, let's see. Yes.

451
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,840
7 + 5. Excellent. 7 + 5 prime plus

452
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,840
prime. So, 12 is a sum of two primes.

453
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,400
The claim is that every even number

454
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,799
starting at four can be written as a sum

455
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,360
of two primes.

456
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,240
And it's called a conjecture because we

457
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,360
don't know if it's true.

458
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,440
I love u I love in math and often

459
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,720
especially in number theory you can

460
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,360
state these very simply uh stated

461
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,640
conjectures, theorems, questions that

462
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,880
are just beyond human understanding.

463
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,919
They're beyond the scope of what modern

464
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,760
mathematical tools are able to tackle.

465
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,440
And it's really pretty that right here

466
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,720
is beyond the cutting edge of math.

467
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,559
We've already gotten there first

468
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
lecture.

469
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,960
Um

470
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,039
yeah, really pretty problem and in fact

471
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,240
in I think 1995 it was highlighted in

472
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,919
the globe as one of the biggest unknown

473
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,600
questions in math. Um right here goldbox

474
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,720
conjecture.

475
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,520
Um for example 20 can be expressed as 9

476
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,799
+ 11.

477
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,799
Oops 9 isn't prime.

478
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,919
Okay. So, have we have we disproven

479
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,360
Goldbox conjecture?

480
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,640
No. Why not? Yes. Yeah. It's 17 plus

481
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,600
three. 20 is 17

482
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,919
plus three.

483
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,480
So, really pretty question. Wish the

484
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,400
reporting had been better, but we can

485
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
forgive them.

486
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,120
Um, are there any questions about

487
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,159
propositions and predicates so far?

488
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,799
Yes.

489
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,799
You said P is not proposition. Yep.

490
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,360
Um it's Yeah, that's very good point.

491
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:49,320
That wording is maybe not great. Um

492
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,320
um is a proposition

493
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,840
that depends on variables. Um except

494
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,840
that

495
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,679
it depends on variables.

496
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,760
Um, it becomes a proposition after you

497
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,360
give values to the variables. Yeah, I

498
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,159
agree. We should we should fix that for

499
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,600
the next go around.

500
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,320
Um, all right. Now that we have

501
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,400
propositions and predicates,

502
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,720
really useful thing is to be able to

503
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,960
combine them into bigger and more

504
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,440
complicated and new propositions and

505
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,280
predicates. And we have a couple what

506
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,679
are called boolean operators that help

507
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,520
us do that. Um, for example,

508
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,520
if A and B are propositions,

509
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,520
propositions,

510
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,440
we have what's called not A.

511
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:47,280
This is a new proposition.

512
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,400
Um, it's sometimes written instead as A

513
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:54,320
with a bar on top. It's sometimes also

514
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,240
written as that weird right angle symbol

515
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,760
next to the A.

516
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,280
These all mean the same thing. They're

517
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,799
just different notations for the same

518
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,760
thing.

519
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,480
And this is just the proposition that A

520
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,679
is false.

521
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,559
A is false.

522
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,440
So you read it as not A and it means A

523
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,880
is false. We can clarify this with

524
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,279
what's called a truth table. So here's A

525
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,200
and A is a proposition which means there

526
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,480
are really only two two possibilities.

527
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,720
It's either true or it's false. And so

528
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,520
let's write down both of those options.

529
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,320
It can be either true or false. And then

530
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,679
we can look at not A

531
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,279
and ask what is not A when A is true.

532
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, not A is supposed to flip it. So

533
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,039
not A is false. And when when A is

534
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,480
false, not A is true.

535
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:52,559
So this truth table can be taken as the

536
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,080
definition of not.

537
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,919
Yeah.

538
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,159
So,

539
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,640
truth

540
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,960
table and let's do some more interesting

541
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,960
truth tables.

542
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,679
Uh let's use two propositions. Now, if

543
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,679
we have A and B,

544
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,360
um well then there are four

545
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,360
possibilities.

546
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,000
They might both be true. A might be true

547
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,919
and B is false or false and true or

548
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,679
false and false. And our truth table is

549
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,360
supposed to cover all the possibilities.

550
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,360
So we're going to have four rows this

551
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,720
time. And let's look at A and

552
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,240
B. This is a new operator

553
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,720
and it means what you think it means

554
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,400
because it's also an English word. A and

555
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,480
B means that both A and B are supposed

556
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,520
to be true. So if A and B are both true

557
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,799
then A and B is true

558
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,799
otherwise it's false.

559
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,480
A and B means both A and B have to be

560
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,919
true.

561
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,919
Likewise we have A or B

562
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,240
which means at least one of A and B has

563
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,360
to be true.

564
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,400
So if they're both true that's fine. If

565
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,080
only A is true, that's fine. If only B

566
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,720
is true, that's fine. The only way for

567
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,799
this to fail is if both A and B are

568
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,360
false.

569
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,720
Uh, so I want to emphasize this is an

570
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,200
inclusive or. It's fine if both of them

571
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,840
are true. It just means that at least

572
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
one of them has to be true.

573
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,520
Um, notationwise,

574
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,640
A and B

575
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,080
is also sometimes denoted A and this

576
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,520
little wedge symbol B.

577
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,279
You can remember it because that looks

578
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
kind of like a capital A for and, but,

579
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,039
but you don't put the cross in. But

580
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,679
honestly, if we're looking for clarity,

581
00:26:53,039 --> 00:27:00,400
I think that's a lot clearer, especially

582
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:03,120
because A or B is also often denoted

583
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,640
with the same symbol upside down. And I

584
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,039
don't have a clever pneumonic for that

585
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,000
one. So if you're trying to remember

586
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,480
which one to use, just use these. That's

587
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,880
my advice.

588
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,039
Um, but back to this or. I said this is

589
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,960
an inclusive or. So it's totally fine if

590
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:24,080
A and B are both true. Um, in English

591
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,880
that's not always what we mean. Uh, and

592
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,200
or not. These are words in spoken

593
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,799
English as well.

594
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,799
And when we're talking about math, when

595
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,000
we're using these words in a math

596
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,559
formula, we mean exactly what's written

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,039
here. But when we use these words in

598
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,200
English, we don't always mean that. Um,

599
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,919
spoken colloquial English or other

600
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,840
spoken languages are imprecise and

601
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,760
context dependent. And that really makes

602
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,520
it difficult to communicate precise

603
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,760
things.

604
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,000
um especially given the fact that as

605
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,240
humans we communicate math using spoken

606
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,960
language. We're trying to communicate

607
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,320
precise things with an imprecise channel

608
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,960
with an imprecise language. So, as an

609
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,720
example of how bad this can get, um

610
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,279
let's look at this word or.

611
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,760
Say you're you're at a nice wedding. Um

612
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,799
the waiter comes around and says, "Did

613
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,279
you order the chicken?

614
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,279
or the pasta.

615
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,960
And when the waiter asks this question,

616
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,279
they're trying to communicate some set

617
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
of allowable responses,

618
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,840
right?

619
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,640
Um, okay. So, are you allowed to say, "I

620
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,360
ordered the chicken." Just the chicken.

621
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,360
Yeah, seems reasonable.

622
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,080
Pasta. You can say, "I ordered the

623
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:55,720
pasta." Can you say

624
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,720
I ordered both?

625
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,399
Probably not. Um the the catering

626
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,799
company got all the RSVP cards in

627
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,440
advance and everyone was told to pick

628
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,679
just one, so they did. So if you tell

629
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,600
the waiter you you picked both, first of

630
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,120
all, you're lying. Second of all, stop

631
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,320
trying to make their jobs harder. It's

632
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,159
hard enough. They have hundreds of

633
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,120
people to serve.

634
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,360
So, probably not expected to say that

635
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,880
one. Likewise, you're probably not

636
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,559
expected to say neither.

637
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,000
I mean, I I could go back and forth on

638
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,039
that one, but let's say everyone filled

639
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,760
out the RSVP card correctly. And so, the

640
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,279
waiter isn't expecting a neither. So,

641
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,600
here,

642
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,039
chicken or pasta, they were they were

643
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,399
allowing this response and this

644
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,919
response, but not these other two

645
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,480
responses.

646
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,840
This is not how we defined or in a math

647
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,640
sense.

648
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,640
This is what's called exclusive or. You

649
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,960
have to pick one or the other but not

650
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,039
both and not neither.

651
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,600
So this is what mathematicians would

652
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:02,320
call exor for exclusive or.

653
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,240
Okay. So after dinner the waiter comes

654
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,720
around and again and says you can have

655
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,720
coffee or tea.

656
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,919
Excellent. What responses are they

657
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,919
expecting this time? Can you say just

658
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,919
coffee?

659
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,559
Yeah. Can you say I want tea? Yeah,

660
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,760
absolutely.

661
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,919
Can you say I want both?

662
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,440
Waiter's going to look at you sideyed

663
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,440
and say there's only one mug in front of

664
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,080
you and I am not mixing them. This is a

665
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,200
fancy venue. So, no. They're probably

666
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,240
not expecting an answer of both. Can you

667
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,760
say neither? I don't want coffee or tea.

668
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,840
Yeah, that's fine. Not everyone wants a

669
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
hot drink. Even at a fancy restaurant,

670
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,399
not everyone wants a fancy wedding. I

671
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,880
apologize.

672
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,679
Not everyone wants a fancy drink, a hot

673
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,679
drink after dinner. So now you can ask

674
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,279
for coffee or tea or neither, but not

675
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,120
both.

676
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,679
Surely that's how we define ore in a

677
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,679
math sense, right?

678
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,279
No,

679
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,679
the these two are swapped. This isn't

680
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,399
or. This is what mathematicians call

681
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,919
NAND. It's the knot of the and

682
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,120
nand.

683
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,840
Okay. Well, waiter used the word ore

684
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,520
twice. Let's try one more. May maybe

685
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,200
they'll get it right this time. You

686
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,080
order you ask for the coffee and they

687
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,080
say you can have cream or sugar.

688
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:41,039
Can you ask for cream? Yeah, absolutely.

689
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,720
Can you ask for sugar? Just sugar.

690
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,559
Yeah. Can you ask for both?

691
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,240
Yeah. Some people like a a really sweet

692
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,960
and creamy drink. Um, both.

693
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,960
Can you ask for neither?

694
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,039
Yeah. Some people like black bitter

695
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,360
coffee inexplicably.

696
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,080
Um, so all four of these options are

697
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,840
valid. This use of the word ore also

698
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,679
doesn't mean what mathematicians mean by

699
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,480
the word or.

700
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,640
This one means anything goes. I'm just

701
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,000
telling you what your options are. I

702
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,760
don't have a math term for that.

703
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,840
True. Yes. Um, so three uses of the word

704
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,080
or. None of them mean what or means.

705
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,440
Isn't language fun?

706
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,679
The moral here is first of all when you

707
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,279
see these in an actual formula with

708
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,840
other predicates and quantifiers and

709
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:39,679
whatnot um we mean exactly what's

710
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,880
written here. If we use it in a sentence

711
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,120
ideally we also mean what's written here

712
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,039
but we might mess up as well and slip

713
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,519
into colloquial context dependent

714
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,039
English. And if you're ever confused,

715
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,279
ask.

716
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
Um, if you're right and we we messed up

717
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,240
the wording, we will thank you and fix

718
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,720
it. If you're wrong and and we meant

719
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,240
what we wrote, well, now you have

720
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,279
confidence that that is what we meant to

721
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,440
write. Uh, and we are both parties are

722
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,679
happier because of it. So, please ask

723
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,399
for clarity if you're ever unsure of the

724
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,880
wording we use, whether it's these

725
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,200
specific words or anything else. Any

726
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,039
questions?

727
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,480
Wonderful.

728
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:26,240
Let's look at one other operator. We've

729
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,399
looked at and and or not. Exor and NAND.

730
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,320
Those are I mean they're there. They're

731
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,960
less important. I would master those

732
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,159
three first. I want to look at one more

733
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,519
that's really important both for this

734
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,840
class and for proof writing and that is

735
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,840
implies.

736
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Implication.

737
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,679
We're going to write it as a

738
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,679
implies b.

739
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Sometimes you'll see it written as a

740
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,399
arrow b or a double arrow b. There's no

741
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,320
difference. These are all notations for

742
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,519
the same thing. For this concept of

743
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,359
implication, a implies b.

744
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,839
Um, and when read aloud, I recommend

745
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:17,480
reading it as a implies b

746
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,480
or equivalently

747
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,240
if a

748
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,200
then b.

749
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,839
If a then b. This is already starting to

750
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,440
look like a programming language. Um,

751
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,599
and if statements in programming

752
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,599
languages are exactly doing what

753
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,040
implication in math is doing. So let's

754
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,520
talk about what that is. Um, as before,

755
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,480
we can figure out what these terms mean

756
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,720
uh by drawing the truth table.

757
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:51,040
So, we have A and B.

758
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:56,960
True, true, false, false. True, false,

759
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:59,280
true, false. Okay. A implies B.

760
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,520
If A and B are both true, does A imply

761
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,839
B?

762
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,400
Seems Yeah, seems pretty intuitive.

763
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,680
Yeah. Okay. If A and B are both false,

764
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,560
if false, then false. Again, seems okay

765
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,760
to me.

766
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,400
All right. If A is true and B is false.

767
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,119
If true, then false.

768
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,160
Does that sound good to you?

769
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,560
I saw a couple headshakes, couple nods,

770
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,079
more headshakes, though. Yeah. If true,

771
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,560
then false. That's kind of the whole

772
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,119
purpose of this wording. If A is true,

773
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,599
then B is true.

774
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,560
So if A is true, then B better be true.

775
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:42,160
And if it's false, we're sad.

776
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:46,880
Yeah. Okay. Last case. If A is false and

777
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,440
B is true, should this be true or false?

778
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,480
Think about it for a second

779
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,800
and let's take a poll. Who thinks false

780
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,640
implies true should be true? Raise your

781
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,800
hand.

782
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,200
Who thinks false implies true should be

783
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,000
false? Raise your hand.

784
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,119
Um, who just wants the answer and

785
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,119
doesn't want to think about it? Raise

786
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,920
both hands.

787
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,839
Okay, the both hands win.

788
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:17,760
Um, it was about an even split. Um, this

789
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:20,240
answer is not so intuitive. Um, in this

790
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,880
sort of abstract setting, if A then B.

791
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,880
Well, what what does it mean? What do we

792
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,800
want it to mean?

793
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,800
I claim, however, this what?

794
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,520
Last line. Oh yeah, sorry. Thank you.

795
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,119
This should be true.

796
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,440
Thank you. See, I do make mistakes.

797
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,520
It's not so clear, but I claim this is a

798
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,960
task that you are all familiar with in a

799
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,839
different context, in many different

800
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:53,160
contexts. So, let's make it concrete.

801
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,160
Let's pick an example. Let's see.

802
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,640
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.

803
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:12,720
Said differently, if it's Wednesday,

804
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:16,720
then wear pink. Wednesday implies pink.

805
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,400
Wednesday implies pink.

806
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,599
Now, it's an implication. And let's go

807
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,119
through the cases and see what's

808
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,760
happening. So, if it's Wednesday and I'm

809
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,599
wearing pink, am I obeying the rule or

810
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
violating it? On Wednesdays, we wear

811
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,680
pink. Yeah, I'm doing what it says. On

812
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,079
Wednesdays, we wear pink. Great. Okay,

813
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,839
so that one's fine. If it's Tuesday and

814
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:44,720
I'm wearing that color, whatever it is,

815
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,720
uh, and not pink, let's hide this. Um,

816
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,680
if it's not Wednesday and I'm not

817
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,560
wearing pink, am I obeying the rule or

818
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,720
violating it? Yeah, I'm obeying that

819
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,040
rule. That's fine. If it's Wednesday and

820
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm wearing blue,

821
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,359
am I obeying the rule or violating it?

822
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm violating it. On Wednesdays, we were

823
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,320
pink. I'm supposed to wear pink. And if

824
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,320
I'm not wearing pink on a Wednesday,

825
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm not doing what the rule says. And

826
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,480
now we get to the confusing case. If

827
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,079
it's Tuesday,

828
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:24,359
not Wednesday, and I am wearing pink, n

829
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,359
obeying the rule or violating it.

830
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,400
Thumbs up.

831
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,000
Anyone think I'm violating it? No. In in

832
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,560
this way, in this concrete setting, it

833
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,400
makes total sense that on Wednesdays we

834
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,680
were pink. On all other days, I don't

835
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,440
care. Anything goes. I only have an

836
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,280
opinion on what you're wearing on

837
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,520
Wednesday.

838
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:52,160
So, we're going to define this to be

839
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:55,040
true. False implies true is true. As I

840
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,640
said, confusing in an abstract setting

841
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,320
makes more sense if you think about it

842
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,079
as obeying a certain rule. If it's

843
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,240
Wednesday, you have to do something

844
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,079
specific. If it's not Wednesday,

845
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,640
anything is fine. Yes. Question.

846
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,079
So, with the example of like Let's say

847
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,720
you're wearing you're violating.

848
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,720
What if you're like

849
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,839
wearing pink as well?

850
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,599
Yeah, good question. What if it's

851
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,000
Wednesday and you're wearing blue? So,

852
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,200
that's what we called the true and false

853
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,280
case, but what if you're wearing blue

854
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,200
and pink? Um, yeah, that was uh that was

855
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,560
a less precise phrasing on my part. I

856
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,839
should have said you're wearing only

857
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,839
blue.

858
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,560
Um, I assume if you're wearing pink and

859
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,160
some other colors, I think that is okay

860
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,720
here. I don't know. I'd have to watch

861
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,400
the movie again.

862
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,680
Um, anyway, implication is confusing.

863
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,720
Let's talk a little bit more about

864
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,440
implication. Um, in English, when we say

865
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,520
A implies B,

866
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,359
often there's a connotation of

867
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,359
causality. A causes B.

868
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,400
And often there's a connotation of time.

869
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,400
A happens and then after that B happens

870
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,640
because of A.

871
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:19,599
So like B is after A is a consequence.

872
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,440
And that is not neither of those is what

873
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,560
we mean. There's no causality. There's

874
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,440
no time.

875
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,760
How do you put a time on um Goldbox

876
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,640
conjecture? when it was conjectured

877
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,680
maybe, but that's not what we mean when

878
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,800
we say gold box conjecture implies

879
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,480
that I'm wearing pink on a Wednesday.

880
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,560
As mathematicians, when we say the word

881
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,240
implies,

882
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,400
we mean this truth table and only this

883
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,079
truth table. There's no additional

884
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,599
connotation. There's no causality.

885
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,880
There's nothing else. It's just this

886
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,800
truth table.

887
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,480
Does that make sense? it can be hard to

888
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,560
sort of flip that switch and redefine

889
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,240
this term that we're familiar with uh

890
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,119
from somewhere else because it does mean

891
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,359
something different now. It means that

892
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,200
uh and if you see this in class, even if

893
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,560
it's written in a paragraph, you should

894
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,720
assume we mean that first.

895
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,720
Was that your question? Please.

896
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,640
Um so clarification on the on sort of

897
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,960
the concept of time. If A then B. Do we

898
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,960
need to know whether A is true or not

899
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,720
before we decide about B? Um I would

900
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,119
recommend thinking about A and B as two

901
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,040
separate propositions. They each have

902
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,839
their own truth value. A is either true

903
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,720
or false. B is either true or false. We

904
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,040
don't necessarily know what they are now

905
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,440
or in the future, but they're still

906
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,720
propositions. A might be the Goldbach

907
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,319
conjecture where we don't know if it's

908
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,960
true or false, but it's still a

909
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,560
proposition. It's still it's still going

910
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,839
to be true or false. We just don't know

911
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,839
yet. Likewise, we can always combine

912
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,200
propositions A and B into this bigger

913
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:16,640
proposition. If A, then B. A implies B.

914
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,480
It's just a new proposition where once

915
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,079
we know whether A and B are true, we'll

916
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:26,079
know whether the implication is true.

917
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:29,520
Does that make sense? Cool.

918
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,710
Um let's see. So another example of

919
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,839
implication

920
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:39,359
[Applause]

921
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,400
you might be familiar with

922
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:46,079
less than three. This is a pre-eoji

923
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,359
heart means I love you.

924
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,079
Got some chuckles. I don't know why I'm

925
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,599
I'm showing my age maybe. Um so less

926
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,200
than three means I love you. What I have

927
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,760
seen

928
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,200
I have seen occasionally

929
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,359
less than four as an intensifier. Like I

930
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,800
really love you. I love you more than

931
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:10,720
three. I love you four.

932
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,760
And this irks me. I hate this. Not

933
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,520
because I'm against love,

934
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,480
but because this is the stronger

935
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,960
mathematical statement. Less than three

936
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,359
implies less than four. If we know x is

937
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,319
less than three, some number x, well,

938
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,839
then we know that x is less than four.

939
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,359
And in fact, we know more information

940
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,880
than that. We know it's not pi,

941
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,680
right?

942
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,160
So this implies that. So this is the

943
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,599
stronger statement. So you've weakened

944
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,599
it. You love me less.

945
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,240
It should be like less than two or

946
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,839
something, but only mathematicians would

947
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,960
get that. So, I don't actually recommend

948
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,440
sending that to your Valentine, but

949
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,920
that's always bothered me.

950
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,560
Uh, let's do one other quick example.

951
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,640
Um, who's familiar with Decart? I think,

952
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,319
therefore I am.

953
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,599
Excellent.

954
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:11,440
Um, so I think, therefore I am.

955
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:14,000
I think, therefore I am.

956
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,000
Um, and this this sort of has two claims

957
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,560
to it. It's not only saying that

958
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,280
thinking implies amming, um, but it's

959
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:26,400
also saying that I think. So it's

960
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,079
asserting that T is true and T implies

961
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,040
am.

962
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,839
Yeah. So that's Dart. What I have seen

963
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,760
that bothers me is a shirt and a pillow

964
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,440
and a meme. And you can go off and buy

965
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,640
all of this. I don't recommend giving it

966
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,000
money. Um, I do not think, therefore, I

967
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:49,440
do not am, which I find hilarious, but

968
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,960
also frustrating. Um, so I do not think

969
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,640
implies

970
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,240
I do not am. Yeah.

971
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,480
So, it's also claiming I don't think. I

972
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,480
don't have an opinion on that. But it's

973
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,440
making it's saying this implication. Not

974
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,960
thinking implies not amming.

975
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,160
And it irks me because that's not

976
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,960
equivalent.

977
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,000
It's not equivalent to daycart.

978
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,800
If let's go out on a limb here and and

979
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,760
let's assume big ask. I know. Let's

980
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,480
assume that my shoe doesn't think. My

981
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,319
right shoe specifically,

982
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,319
but it still exists. Let's assume. If my

983
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,319
shoe thinks and doesn't uh sorry,

984
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,599
doesn't think but still exists,

985
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:34,160
Daycart's fine with that. False implies

986
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,640
true is fine.

987
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,359
But the meme isn't. Not thinking is

988
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,720
supposed to imply not amming. But my

989
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:45,839
shoe ams even if it doesn't think. So

990
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,920
these two statements are not equivalent.

991
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,240
It should be I do not am therefore I do

992
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:55,640
not think which gets zero hits on

993
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,640
Google. We need to fix this question.

994
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,720
All right. That's a great comment. Let's

995
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,720
see. Um, let's go back to the front.

996
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,800
Um, what your colleague suggested was we

997
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,839
can write A implies B by combining the

998
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:27,000
earlier operators.

999
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:27,000
Oops. A implies B is equivalent to

1000
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,040
um, and can you remind me what you said?

1001
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:38,240
It was or not and not

1002
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,400
okay B or

1003
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,079
uh not A

1004
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,280
and

1005
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,680
not B. And the claim is that this is

1006
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,960
equivalent to A implies B has the same

1007
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,640
truth table as A implies B. In fact, if

1008
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,480
you if you check it, we can simplify it

1009
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,960
even further. We don't need this extra

1010
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,960
clause on B.

1011
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,800
B or not A.

1012
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:08,319
this is equivalent to a implies b.

1013
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,440
Um, what this is really saying is that

1014
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,520
the only way to violate this, the only

1015
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,480
way to violate a implies b is for a to

1016
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,720
be true and b to be false. And so if

1017
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,280
either of these is true, then you're

1018
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,640
fine.

1019
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,640
Yeah, absolutely. There are

1020
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,440
relationships between these operators.

1021
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,680
Um, really nice observation.

1022
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,119
Um, but going back to Decart for just a

1023
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:37,200
second, um, we looked at

1024
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,599
A implies B and we also looked at, um,

1025
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,040
not A implies B. Let me look, let's look

1026
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:47,040
at some others. B implies A.

1027
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,760
Not B implies not A.

1028
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,760
If this is our statement, A implies B.

1029
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,240
If we flip them around, B implies A.

1030
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,240
That's called the converse.

1031
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,079
That's the converse of the original

1032
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:02,560
statement. And this one here, not B

1033
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,560
implies not A, that's what's called the

1034
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,560
contraositive.

1035
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,880
Uh, and the one we saw over there with

1036
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,240
um what not A implies not B, that's

1037
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,599
called the inverse.

1038
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,119
You don't really need to know all of

1039
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,359
these terms. It's just nice to know

1040
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,839
they're there because

1041
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,800
A implies B

1042
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:32,079
is equivalent to one of these two and

1043
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,359
it's not it's not the the nice one. A

1044
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,960
implies B is equivalent to its

1045
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:39,839
contraositive. Not B implies not A.

1046
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,280
Wednesday implies pink. So if you're not

1047
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,520
wearing pink, it better not be

1048
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,839
Wednesday.

1049
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,559
A implies B. Not B implies not A. So

1050
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,640
these two are equivalent.

1051
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,079
And also the converse and the inverse

1052
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,280
are equivalent for the same reason.

1053
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:58,960
They're contraositives of each other.

1054
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,040
Um so that day cartme was using the

1055
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,640
inverse when they probably meant to use

1056
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,079
the contraositive. I I assume because I

1057
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,280
assume they thought that deeply about

1058
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,440
it. Um that is everything I wanted to

1059
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,720
say about implication. Does anyone have

1060
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,720
more questions before we move on?

1061
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,359
All right.

1062
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:26,000
[Applause]

1063
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:29,440
Now, very briefly, I've mentioned sets a

1064
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,119
few times and I've used set notation a

1065
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,880
few times.

1066
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,880
So, let's let's go ahead and make that

1067
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,640
more precise because we're going to be

1068
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,040
talking about sets all term. I just want

1069
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,640
us to have that common language to fall

1070
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,640
back on. So, a set

1071
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,680
is a collection of objects.

1072
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,480
Um, I'm not going to be more precise

1073
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,400
than this. If you want to dig into that,

1074
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,400
into set theory, into the foundations of

1075
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,839
mathematics, it's really interesting.

1076
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,280
There's a lot of stuff there, but that's

1077
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:12,000
not what we're doing in this course. A

1078
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,000
set is a a collection of objects. Um,

1079
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,880
let me give lots of examples. An example

1080
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,960
is the set that contains six, one, two,

1081
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,720
and zero. And we're going to write sets

1082
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,400
with these curly braces. Crucially,

1083
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,920
um, when we when we're talking about a

1084
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,800
set,

1085
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,800
the order doesn't matter.

1086
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,079
And there's no such thing as a repeat.

1087
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,079
All I care about is which things are in

1088
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:51,200
your set and which ones aren't. So this

1089
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:52,400
set is exactly equal to 2 1 6 0

1090
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,400
because they have the same four

1091
00:50:52,400 --> 00:51:01,599
elements. This set is exactly equal to

1092
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,440
six uh yeah 6 1 2 O.

1093
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,079
It's kind of weird to write O in there

1094
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,520
twice, but technically it's okay. I

1095
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,400
don't recommend doing that. Um, but this

1096
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,000
has the four numbers 0, 1, 2, and six in

1097
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,680
it. And so do these other sets. They're

1098
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,640
exactly the same set. Yeah, we already

1099
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,720
saw n the natural numbers. This is the

1100
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,400
set 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on all the way

1101
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:31,680
up.

1102
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:34,480
Um, yeah, we also have the set that's a

1103
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:37,599
blackboard bold Z.

1104
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,760
um which includes the integers the

1105
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,200
natural numbers and their negatives 1

1106
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,839
and minus one and two and minus2 and so

1107
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,839
on all the integers

1108
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:52,960
integers.

1109
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:56,839
Um a couple more useful ones we have Q

1110
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,839
is the set of rationals.

1111
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,240
So fractions you can get by dividing

1112
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,760
some integer by some non-zero integer.

1113
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:08,319
Uh, we have the real numbers.

1114
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,000
That's a that's a bold R. Blackboard

1115
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:15,400
bold R. Um, and we also have C, the

1116
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,400
complex numbers.

1117
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,040
Complex numbers.

1118
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,040
So those are five sets that we will very

1119
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:29,680
frequently talk about. Uh, let's give

1120
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,000
some more examples of sets. There's the

1121
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,000
empty set.

1122
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,480
which is written

1123
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,200
as a circle with a slash through it.

1124
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,960
It's also sometimes written as an open

1125
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,359
curly brace and a closed curly brace

1126
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,680
with nothing inside.

1127
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,960
Yeah, these these two mean the same

1128
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,119
thing. They're just different notations

1129
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,480
for the same thing. The empty set is a

1130
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,400
set that contains nothing. It is a set.

1131
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,440
It is a thing. It does exist. It just

1132
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,200
has zero elements. Whereas this set over

1133
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,839
here has four elements. This set over

1134
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,520
here has a has infinitely many elements.

1135
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,920
These other sets have infinitely many

1136
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,400
elements as well. But is it the same

1137
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,720
infinity?

1138
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,240
Not not always. And that's a confusing

1139
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,960
thing. Come ask me if you're curious. Um

1140
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,040
let's see one other set I wanted to give

1141
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,000
an example of. Let's call this one A

1142
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,960
just so we have a name for it.

1143
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Uh let's define B is what did I want to

1144
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:34,559
write? Yeah. two,

1145
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:37,760
three, four, and empty set.

1146
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:40,480
B is a set with three elements.

1147
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,800
It has the number two as an element. It

1148
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,079
has this set as an element and it has

1149
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:50,680
the empty set as an element.

1150
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,680
Is three an element of B?

1151
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,520
We would write this as three is an

1152
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:01,119
element of B. There's that notation

1153
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,800
again. Is three an element of B? No.

1154
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:06,000
It's inside one of the elements of B,

1155
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:08,480
but it's not one of the elements itself.

1156
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,599
So, no.

1157
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:15,119
Uh, so we have this notation. Oh, no. I

1158
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:17,280
just used that. Let's move over here.

1159
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,319
Eraser help.

1160
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,480
Found it.

1161
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,960
We have this notion of being an element

1162
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,839
of a set that we uh have already talked

1163
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:32,400
about a few times. uh you can also ask a

1164
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:35,880
set to be a subset of another one. So x

1165
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,880
in a

1166
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:44,040
means x is

1167
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,040
an element of a

1168
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:50,720
a and then this new symbol this is a a

1169
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,240
sideways or this is a curly c uh with a

1170
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,400
line underneath it. A is a subset or

1171
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:01,160
equal to B.

1172
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,160
A is a subset

1173
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,760
or equal to B. Not the similarity to A

1174
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,280
is less equal to B. Um less equal

1175
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,480
doesn't really make sense for sets, but

1176
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,520
this one does. Subset means everything

1177
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,240
that's in A is also in B and B might

1178
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,440
contain more besides.

1179
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,599
For example, the set that contains um

1180
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,359
two and one.

1181
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,480
Is that a subset of A

1182
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:33,280
was over there?

1183
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,559
Yeah. Everything that's in here is also

1184
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,960
in here. Totally fine.

1185
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:43,440
Um

1186
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,760
let's see. Is the empty set a subset of

1187
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,760
A?

1188
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,760
Cool.

1189
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,559
All right. I got some thumbs up. I got

1190
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,079
no thumbs down. I got a lot of blank

1191
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,359
faces. I'm going to assume that means

1192
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,040
yes. Yeah. Um, everything that's an

1193
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:11,280
element of the empty set should also be

1194
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,720
an element of a.

1195
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,960
Well, it's kind of weird, right? Because

1196
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,559
there are no elements of the empty set.

1197
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:21,599
So, and we can't really check this this

1198
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,520
rule for any elements of the left. So,

1199
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,359
it kind of feels like this shouldn't be

1200
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,880
true because there's nothing to

1201
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,280
instantiate. There's there are no

1202
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:32,400
elements here to talk about.

1203
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,960
Um, but a better way to think of it is

1204
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,559
prove me wrong.

1205
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,640
Show me an element on the left that

1206
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,799
isn't an element on the right. You

1207
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,880
can't.

1208
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:46,240
You can't violate the rule and therefore

1209
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,240
the rule is satisfied.

1210
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,200
Yeah, a little bit confusing, but um

1211
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,640
when you look at it the right way,

1212
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:57,520
hopefully it makes sense. All right,

1213
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,200
just like we were able to combine um

1214
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:04,559
propositions A and B, A or B, um we can

1215
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:10,040
combine sets. We can look at like a

1216
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,040
union B. This is the union

1217
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,440
which is the set of elements that are in

1218
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,799
A or B or both.

1219
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,359
Yeah. So in this case A union B

1220
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:24,319
for our example it certainly includes

1221
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,319
six and one and two and zero. Uh and

1222
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,480
also well it already has two so we don't

1223
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:33,440
need to write that again. And it has the

1224
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:37,200
set three four and it has the empty set.

1225
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,880
So everything in A or B or both. Um and

1226
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,480
remember I don't have to say the or both

1227
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,799
because or is inclusive by default.

1228
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,280
All right. Uh we can likewise do a

1229
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:51,040
intersect b

1230
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:54,599
which is the elements that are in both.

1231
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,599
So the intersection

1232
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:01,599
in this case a intersect b

1233
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,079
is well what's in both a and b? I think

1234
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,000
it's just the two. There's a two in both

1235
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,920
and nothing else is in common. So that's

1236
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,799
going to be just the set containing two.

1237
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:16,880
There's also the set difference

1238
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:19,760
A minus B, sometimes written as A

1239
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:23,799
backslash B.

1240
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,799
Uh, and that's the set difference.

1241
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,640
It's the things in A that aren't in B.

1242
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,760
So it's a but take away everything in b.

1243
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,480
So in this case it's going to equal

1244
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,559
six and one and not the two but we still

1245
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,559
keep the zero.

1246
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,559
Yes.

1247
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,599
Yep.

1248
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,559
Good question. So the question was,

1249
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,119
we've already said that the empty set is

1250
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:06,079
a subset of everything.

1251
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:09,680
So shouldn't it be in both A and B and

1252
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:13,359
therefore in their intersection?

1253
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,040
Really good question. Um and the

1254
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,839
difference is that we have two different

1255
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:20,799
meanings of sort of in. Um we said that

1256
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:23,440
the empty set is a subset of everything

1257
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:25,760
but not an element of everything.

1258
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,040
So the empty set is an element of B

1259
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,240
because it was written as one of the

1260
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,680
elements, but it's not an element of A

1261
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,000
because these are all four elements of

1262
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,400
A. There's nothing else in there. So A

1263
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,079
is a subset, sorry, the empty set is a

1264
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:43,599
subset of A and a subset of B, but it's

1265
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,359
not an element of both.

1266
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,240
Great question. Thank you for asking.

1267
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,359
Yes.

1268
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:52,160
Why can A have two zeros?

1269
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:55,440
Um, why can a have two zeros if there's

1270
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,040
no repeats? Good question. Um, it's

1271
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,720
because it doesn't actually have two

1272
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,480
zeros. Um, I just wrote the two zeros.

1273
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,480
Each of them says zero is an element of

1274
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,359
this set. By the way, did you forget

1275
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,799
zero is an element of this set. Uh, so

1276
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:12,559
it doesn't have two. There's no way for

1277
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:14,640
it to remember it has two. Um, but

1278
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,480
sometimes in some weird cases it might

1279
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,119
make sense to write a to write a set

1280
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:24,520
where the same element is written twice.

1281
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,520
Um, and so there's that example.

1282
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,160
All right. Yes. Question.

1283
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:43,520
That's a great question. So if a if a

1284
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,359
also had a three and a four in it. So

1285
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,200
let's let's pretend this also has a

1286
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:51,040
three and a four in it. And then we ask

1287
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,720
about a minus b. We take away from a

1288
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,280
everything that's in b. Everything

1289
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:59,280
that's an element of b. So would we be

1290
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,440
removing the three and four? So if we

1291
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,079
have a six and a one and a two and a

1292
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,160
zero and a three and a four

1293
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:11,440
and we subtract

1294
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:14,640
the set what was it? two and three four

1295
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,359
and empty set. And the answer is no. The

1296
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,520
three and four don't go away because we

1297
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,319
want to take all the elements of the

1298
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,880
first set that are not elements of the

1299
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,720
second set. And three and four are not

1300
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,119
elements of the second set. They're

1301
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,839
they're nested too deep.

1302
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,680
Um three is not an element of this set.

1303
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,599
This whole set is an element of this

1304
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,760
set.

1305
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,559
Yeah, make sense? Cool. So this

1306
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,760
difference would keep the six and the

1307
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,960
one not the two would keep the zero and

1308
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,480
keep the three and keep the four.

1309
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,720
Awesome.

1310
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:56,559
All right. Similar to sets we have oh

1311
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,880
sorry before that um one of the reasons

1312
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:01,680
I'm talking about sets right now beyond

1313
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,480
the fact that we need to talk about sets

1314
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:07,040
um is the fact that sets and

1315
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,119
propositions and predicates

1316
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,240
are very closely related and they can

1317
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,240
both be useful for the other.

1318
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,160
Um specifically I want to talk about set

1319
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,160
builder notation.

1320
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:36,240
And that is where you take a set and you

1321
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,720
you describe a subset of the set by

1322
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,440
using a predicate.

1323
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:45,760
So for example uh we can look at the set

1324
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:50,119
of all n in the natural numbers

1325
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,119
such that n is prime.

1326
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,000
So we have this predicate of n over here

1327
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,000
on the right and we're pulling out all

1328
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,640
of the elements of this set the natural

1329
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,640
numbers but only the ones that satisfy

1330
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,559
our predicate.

1331
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,119
So this is set builder notation. You

1332
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,440
have elements of a set such that this

1333
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,480
predicate is satisfied. This is the

1334
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,640
notation we'll use. Um and this set of

1335
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:29,960
course will return the set of primes.

1336
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:29,960
2 3 5 7 not 9 globe 11 and so on.

1337
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,240
Very useful. We're going to use that all

1338
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,319
the time.

1339
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,319
All right. Similar to sets, we have

1340
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,319
tupils.

1341
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,240
This is an ordered list of elements.

1342
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,640
And repeats are okay.

1343
01:03:54,799 --> 01:04:00,200
And it's written with parentheses

1344
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,200
instead of curly braces.

1345
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:17,440
For example, the tupole 6 1 2 0

1346
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:23,039
is a sequence with four elements.

1347
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:26,079
This is not the same as 6 1 2 0 0 which

1348
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,920
is a tupole with five elements.

1349
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,079
Right? As sets they're the same. They

1350
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,680
have the same elements, but this one has

1351
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,920
repeats. Um, so they're different. And

1352
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:40,559
likewise, neither of these is equivalent

1353
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:42,079
to 2 1 6 0 because the order is

1354
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:45,920
different even if the elements are the

1355
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:49,680
same. So a tupole cares about the order.

1356
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,760
Um, by the way, last I checked, um, 2160

1357
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,480
is identification, estimation, and

1358
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,920
learning in mech.

1359
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,000
Not the same even though they have the

1360
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,799
same digits.

1361
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,720
um doesn't really make sense to ask for

1362
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:05,280
the intersection or the union or the

1363
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:08,319
difference of tupils.

1364
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:12,079
Uh so we're not even going to try.

1365
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:13,920
Any questions about sets or tupils?

1366
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,640
Nice.

1367
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,880
All right, let's go back to the

1368
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:23,839
definition I probably deleted already.

1369
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,160
Um, a proof is a verification of a

1370
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:29,920
proposition by a sequence of logical

1371
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,000
deductions from a base set of axioms. I

1372
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,240
hope I got that right. We've already

1373
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,480
talked at length about propositions, one

1374
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,079
of those three terms.

1375
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:42,240
Let's turn to the next one, axioms.

1376
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:45,480
Uh, we've used both of those boards onto

1377
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,480
this board.

1378
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,760
Nice.

1379
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,240
An axiom.

1380
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,880
Let's see.

1381
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,960
Is a proposition we assume

1382
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,559
is true.

1383
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,720
You you might have heard when you're

1384
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,079
writing mathematical proofs, you

1385
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,559
shouldn't be assuming anything. You have

1386
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,480
to prove everything. And that's not

1387
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,400
quite true. We need somewhere to start.

1388
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,799
We need some foundation to build up

1389
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,119
from.

1390
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:38,400
The trick is to declare all of them in

1391
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:41,760
advance. These are the axioms I'm using.

1392
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,240
And if you assume these axioms,

1393
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,440
then these proofs tell you other things

1394
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,760
that also have to be true. So the axioms

1395
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,400
are the things you start with. We take

1396
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,160
them to be true. Sometimes people say we

1397
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,920
take them to be self-evident, but I

1398
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:00,240
don't like that phrasing because

1399
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:04,079
they're they're not necessarily true in

1400
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:05,839
some um holistic sense. We just assume

1401
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,520
them to be true for the sake of the math

1402
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:10,000
we're doing now.

1403
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,559
uh and in fact you can often have axioms

1404
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,039
that contradict each other as long as

1405
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:18,160
you're not using them at the same time.

1406
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:21,200
Uh for example,

1407
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,799
let's see for example we have the famous

1408
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,119
um

1409
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:26,119
uh Uklid's

1410
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,160
parallel

1411
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,200
postulate.

1412
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:37,440
So, Uklid in like 200 BC or whenever he

1413
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:41,119
was alive, maybe 2000, someone can tell

1414
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:43,839
me, um, wrote a book, The Elements,

1415
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,680
Uklid's Elements, that chronicled all of

1416
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,760
Uklitian geometry. That's why it's

1417
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,640
called Uklitian geometry. He literally

1418
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,720
wrote the book on it. Um, and at the

1419
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,799
beginning of the book, he had five

1420
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,599
axioms. Postulate is another word for

1421
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:00,240
axiom, a little little outdated, but

1422
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,119
still there. Um and the parallel

1423
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:06,799
postulate, the fifth of the five axioms,

1424
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:08,480
um famously for centuries, millennia,

1425
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,160
people kept trying to prove that

1426
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,640
actually the parallel postulate doesn't

1427
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,880
have to be an axiom. You can prove it's

1428
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,719
true if you only assume the first four

1429
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,319
axioms.

1430
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:21,120
So it doesn't have to be an a, it can be

1431
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,799
a theorem. And people kept trying and

1432
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,400
kept trying and kept trying. By the way,

1433
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:28,799
the statement of of the parallel

1434
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:31,799
postulate is that um for every uh point

1435
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,799
P

1436
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:41,839
and line L um that doesn't contain P

1437
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:45,080
P not in L

1438
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:45,080
there exists

1439
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:52,359
a unique line

1440
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:52,359
L prime M

1441
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:59,920
through P

1442
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:02,640
parallel to L.

1443
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,560
In picture, if you have a point here and

1444
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,159
some line that doesn't go through that

1445
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,440
point,

1446
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:11,279
then there's a unique line

1447
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,719
parallel and going through your point.

1448
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,640
Here's P. Here's L. Intuitive, right?

1449
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,640
Makes sense.

1450
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:22,480
uh and Uklid took this as an axiom and

1451
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:24,159
and went with it. But can we can we

1452
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,120
prove this based on the other four

1453
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:31,440
axioms and turns out thousands of years

1454
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:33,839
later we finally know the answer? No.

1455
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,640
No. Um this is not a theorem. It does

1456
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:39,520
not follow from the other four axioms

1457
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,960
because

1458
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,960
we know what happens if you change the

1459
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,239
axiom.

1460
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,199
Um things do happen in a meaningful way.

1461
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:51,520
Uh for example, instead of saying there

1462
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:55,040
is a unique line,

1463
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,360
a unique line, let's change that to no

1464
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,199
lines.

1465
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,000
There are no lines through your point

1466
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:05,040
parallel to your line. The concept of

1467
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,920
parallel lines doesn't exist.

1468
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:10,320
If we use that axiom instead of Uklid's

1469
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,120
version and the other four axioms that

1470
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:17,560
Uklid um did

1471
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,560
um you can get spherical geometry.

1472
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:26,239
In spherical geometry

1473
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:30,320
um your your plane your canvas is a

1474
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:32,480
sphere instead of a plane. A line is a

1475
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,480
great circle.

1476
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:38,159
It's a circle whose center is the center

1477
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:41,280
of the sphere. And a point isn't just a

1478
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:43,920
point, but it's a point and its

1479
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:46,800
antipode, the one directly across from

1480
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:49,760
from it on the sphere. And if that's how

1481
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,520
we define points and lines, then there

1482
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,600
are no parallel lines. All great circles

1483
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,400
intersect each other.

1484
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,400
Um, and we get a meaningful geometry

1485
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,640
that we can prove stuff with, that we

1486
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,880
can prove different things with than

1487
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,800
Uklid could.

1488
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,920
Since we have a different set of axioms,

1489
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:10,159
we're going to have a different set of

1490
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,000
conclusions, but it's still meaningful.

1491
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:17,960
Likewise, if we replace this, instead of

1492
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,960
no lines, we do infinitely many lines.

1493
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,159
Well, there's another version of

1494
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:25,159
geometry that does that. It's hyperbolic

1495
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:25,159
geometry.

1496
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,040
um lots of ways to draw it, but

1497
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,920
sometimes it's drawn in a circle. But

1498
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:42,719
now, now a line is a part of a circle

1499
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:45,280
that's perpendicular to the boundary. A

1500
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:47,600
point is just a point.

1501
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,920
But now if we have a a line and a point

1502
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,400
not on that line, well, parallel just

1503
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:56,480
means they don't intersect. So, well,

1504
01:11:52,400 --> 01:12:01,440
here is a line through P that doesn't

1505
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:03,120
intersect L. Well, here's another one.

1506
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,760
And here's another one. There are lots

1507
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,320
of them. Infinitely many lines through P

1508
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,080
that don't touch L.

1509
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,760
Um,

1510
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,400
and so this is a different kind of

1511
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,719
geometry that satisfies a different set

1512
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,239
of axioms.

1513
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,840
And so, no, you can't prove the fifth

1514
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,360
axiom from the first four because you

1515
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,199
can change the fifth one and get new

1516
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,960
conclusions that make sense and aren't

1517
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,800
contradictory.

1518
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:30,080
Now, I've said a couple times we can

1519
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:32,000
change it uh and get a new system of

1520
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,400
geometry.

1521
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,320
Well, sort of you can imagine you can

1522
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,400
always change your axioms to some other

1523
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:41,280
set of assumptions

1524
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:45,600
and make a mathematical theory out of

1525
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:48,880
it. Does any set of assumptions work?

1526
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,480
Are they all as good as the others?

1527
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,760
Well,

1528
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,159
there are a couple things that can go

1529
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,239
wrong. There are a couple properties you

1530
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:59,239
might want your set of axioms to

1531
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,239
satisfy.

1532
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,560
A set of axioms

1533
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,440
axioms

1534
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,440
is consistent

1535
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,600
when you can't

1536
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,320
prove

1537
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:29,440
that false

1538
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:32,480
is true.

1539
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:34,239
And we kind of need that, right? Um let

1540
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,560
me see if that's how we defined it.

1541
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:38,640
Yeah. Yeah. If no proposition can be

1542
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,800
proved and disproved,

1543
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,440
um we we kind of need true and false to

1544
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:46,320
be different things because remember

1545
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,600
false implies anything you want. That's

1546
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,159
sometimes called the principle of

1547
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,360
explosion by the way. Great name. False

1548
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:56,480
implies anything. So if false is true

1549
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:59,199
and false implies anything then then

1550
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:01,840
everything is true.

1551
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,280
So we don't want to be able to prove

1552
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,080
that false is true because then our

1553
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,920
theory is is uninteresting because

1554
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,400
everything is true and everything is

1555
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,600
false. So we definitely want a set of

1556
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:15,120
axioms that is consistent.

1557
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,920
Ideally, we would also have a set of

1558
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:22,360
axioms.

1559
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,360
set of axioms is complete

1560
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:34,440
when every true let's see um yeah every

1561
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,440
true proposition

1562
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,040
can be proved

1563
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,480
from the axioms

1564
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:51,600
right we want things to be true or false

1565
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,040
and we want proof to be the metric by

1566
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,880
which we decide whether something is

1567
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:57,840
true or false. If we can find a proof

1568
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,520
for it, it's true. Um, ideally if it's

1569
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,159
not true, we'd be able to find a proof

1570
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,040
for the opposite for the not of that

1571
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:06,719
proposition. Right? So, sort of the

1572
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,199
baseline things, the two things you

1573
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,120
would want in a set of axioms that is

1574
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:12,640
nice to work with. You would want it to

1575
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,719
be consistent, you would want it to be

1576
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,640
complete.

1577
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,920
And then Kurt Girdle comes along and

1578
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,199
says, "Nope, can't have both.

1579
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,679
There's what's called the Girdle

1580
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:27,440
incompleteness theorem.

1581
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:29,840
That's go olla d.

1582
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:32,320
Girdle was able to prove that you can't

1583
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:35,600
have a system of axioms that is both

1584
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:38,480
consistent and complete as long as it's

1585
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,679
complicated enough to just do

1586
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,679
arithmetic, addition, and

1587
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,679
multiplication.

1588
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,560
can't have both.

1589
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,040
We certainly want to be able to add and

1590
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,880
multiply numbers,

1591
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,360
which means we have to pick consistency

1592
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,760
or completeness. And I know which one

1593
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:00,080
I'm picking. I'm going to pick

1594
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,520
consistent so that true and false have

1595
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:06,159
meaning. what this means and this is

1596
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,640
kind of a this kind of messes with my

1597
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:10,080
head a little bit. What Girdle's

1598
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,480
completeness theorem in sorry

1599
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:15,679
incompleteness theorem tells us is that

1600
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,360
there are true statements in math in

1601
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,600
whatever set of axioms we're working

1602
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:22,560
with there are true statements that

1603
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,520
cannot be proved

1604
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,000
you're never going to be able to

1605
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,239
disprove it but if you want to prove it

1606
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,560
you have to add more axioms

1607
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,960
but then once you add more axioms that

1608
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,560
bigger set of axioms now has other true

1609
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,199
statements that can't be proved with

1610
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:40,239
those axioms

1611
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:43,120
um So conceivably we might ask you to

1612
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:44,960
prove a problem in homework that can't

1613
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,040
be proved from the axioms even though

1614
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,920
it's true. We're not going to do that.

1615
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,440
That's mean. Um conceivably goldbox

1616
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,640
conjecture

1617
01:16:51,440 --> 01:17:00,040
might be true but unprovable

1618
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:00,040
maybe. I don't know. Uh question.

1619
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,320
Yeah. Excellent question. And if

1620
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,480
something doesn't have a proof, how do

1621
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,719
we know it's true?

1622
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,640
Um, that is a really good question and

1623
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,239
and that's also getting back into the

1624
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,400
the set theory and logic and

1625
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:18,719
underpinnings of math that are too in

1626
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,239
the weeds for this course. Um, but I'm

1627
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,760
happy to discuss it afterward if you'd

1628
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:23,840
like.

1629
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,880
Um, last thing I want to say about

1630
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,960
axioms, every mathematician needs a set

1631
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,040
of axioms that they're working with so

1632
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:35,040
they know what they're allowed to assume

1633
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:39,199
as they're proving new things. Um,

1634
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:41,360
What a we use in this class.

1635
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,360
Roughly speaking, all of high school

1636
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:46,640
math.

1637
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:49,679
Let's say that any fact that you think

1638
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:52,080
is general enough and familiar enough

1639
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,440
and simple enough to be included in

1640
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,840
basically every high school math

1641
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:59,360
curriculum, you're allowed to assume it

1642
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:03,280
and go from there. Um, ideally, we ask

1643
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:05,440
you to identify it. Write down fact.

1644
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,360
Right. write the theorem you're stating

1645
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:10,800
or the theorem you're assuming like the

1646
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:12,880
product of two even numbers is even.

1647
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,280
I know this from high school and then go

1648
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:19,360
ahead and use it because ideally at

1649
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:21,920
every step in a proof we know why each

1650
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,840
thing is true and if sometimes the

1651
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:28,040
reason is that's an axiom I'm assuming

1652
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,040
it we should say that.

1653
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,760
Are there any questions?

1654
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,080
All right, that's all I've got. Be sure

1655
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,000
to go to recitation tomorrow. Um, you

1656
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,080
can check your time on Canvas. You can

1657
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,840
switch your time on Canvas. We look

1658
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:44,840
forward to seeing you then. Thank you so

1659
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,840
much.
