1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,120
Okay, good morning. So speaking of skill

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,920
sets, uh in my previous life I was an

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,520
electrical engineer. Uh but then as I

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,199
typically joke I switched to a dark

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,320
side. So I got my PhD in economics and

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,279
uh you will hear in many of my remarks

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,199
well my inner economist. Right? So here

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,880
in the United States economics is a

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,120
dismal science. So it means that we

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,920
economists are always unhappy and so it

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,559
means that we always try to find okay

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
what is really about that. So that's why

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,600
I admire presentations like Charles has

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,160
done recently and well we have many of

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,960
these wonderful researchers at MIT who

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,039
are so enthusiastic that well we are

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,360
going to solve all the problems and kind

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,800
of here are the all the solutions. So my

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,199
job is to find where's the catch. So

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
sometimes we assume for example well a

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,199
catalyst in one of the paper on

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,760
directory capture wonderful fantastic

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,240
paper which will say well we will be

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
able to do that at a reasonable cost and

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,439
well kind of we were trying to

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,280
understand and find out that well they

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,240
assume a catalyst which hasn't been

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,040
invented yet and so well things like

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,640
that may slow you down. So as a result

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,280
what we are trying to do we are trying

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,799
to understand globally where we are

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,680
going and what are the current pathways

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,759
what we should expect as a company you

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,439
want to have the optimism you want to

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,560
think well what are the latest and

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,640
greatest but also you need to understand

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,799
well what are the realistic things and

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,880
when we might come to the market. So

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,680
well let's start with a big big picture

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,759
and we always like to try to make sure

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,320
that we are speaking in the same

42
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,079
language that we are making sure that uh

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,399
we know where we are going where the

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,799
world is going. So I start with this

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,880
diagram which should be familiar to many

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,759
of you. This is a diagram from the

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,920
latest IPCC report intergovernmental

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
intergovernmental panel on climate

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,599
change. And this is the diagram which

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,160
shows where the world is currently going

51
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,800
well according to their projections uh

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
at that point and where we need to be.

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
And you can see that well those

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
trajectories are very very different.

55
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,520
And even more than that if you're going

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,720
to take a look where we were in last

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,879
year last published numbers uh in terms

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,400
of the total greenhouse gases we

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,440
actually about outside of their

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,760
confidence interval. So 5 to 95%. So we

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,080
are still moving in the wrong direction

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,519
in terms of the greenhouse gases at the

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,160
global level and well uh there is a

64
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,319
recent UN uh emissions gap report and

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,040
you see some quotes from there where

66
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,560
they try to understand in the Paris

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,720
agreement process there is something

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
which is called NDC

69
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,519
and so national determined contributions

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
where countries are making pledges we're

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
making promises what they are going to

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,760
do and you have to be careful with

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,640
interpreting those pled pledges but at

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,400
least that gives you the incentives what

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
countries are trying to do and for

76
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
example there is a pledge from the

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,959
United States which is still on the

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,959
website which says that in 2035 United

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,879
States is going to reduce emissions by

80
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,000
60% well more precisely 61 to 66 is that

81
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,239
going to happen well your guess is as

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
good as my guess but most likely we are

83
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
not going to be there not in 2030 not in

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,920
2035 so again whenever you are looking

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,480
at those NDCs you also need to provide

86
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,120
some expert judgments where we are going

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,319
and we are not going fast enough. So

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,959
coming back to going fast enough and I

89
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,120
just show you the graph which is in the

90
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,000
emission units but if we're talking

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,560
about sustainable pathways emissions

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,400
just a part of the game we need to

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,599
understand what else matters and so well

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,840
what the world is doing about that word

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,920
sustainability which is a very fantastic

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,159
world everybody word everybody likes

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
that word uh because everybody has a

98
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,159
different meaning to that word so you

99
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,639
can interpret that in many many way you

100
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,440
can do it like UN with sustainable

101
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,440
development goals uh which has 17 of

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,000
them you are seeing all of them the

103
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,960
problem with that it's too many and how

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,600
to quantify so a lot of issues with

105
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,840
trying to cover everything so typically

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,919
when we talk about sustainability we try

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,600
to boil it down to something little bit

108
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,000
more manageable which you can

109
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,199
communicate so again emission reduction

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,440
is very important so we know that we

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,840
need to make sure that We are avoiding

112
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,240
these future extreme events which uh

113
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,560
changes uh which climate change is going

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,280
to bring to us. But there are other

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,160
aspects which are equally important

116
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,960
sometimes even more important and you

117
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
see the listed there while obviously

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,479
affordability

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,800
and you need to have affordable

120
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,000
solutions. So not just technologically

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,560
possible solution but also well is it

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,600
going to make economic sense and also

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,520
right now in the world of change

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
geopolitics or kind of where we are

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
going in terms of the geopolitics we

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,720
also need to understand more and more

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,199
about the security of supply and

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,479
security of supply not just energy but

129
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,039
food water and many other aspects

130
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,720
and also you need to make sure that you

131
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,360
are not just talking about the big

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,000
picture. Oh well, what is the energy at

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,080
the level of the country or at the level

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
of European Union or the level of

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,560
Africa? Because after all, you are doing

136
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,280
that to make sure that you are making

137
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,479
resilient your local community. And it

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,919
means that you have the integration

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,240
problem or integration issue to resolve

140
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,520
where you are not only provide energy in

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,360
a resilient fashion and you are not only

142
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,919
making sure that your energy

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,039
infrastructure is resilient to different

144
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,840
type of extreme events but also how that

145
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,880
relates to transportation system to

146
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,520
buildings to food to water and so there

147
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,160
are many aspects where do need to have a

148
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,240
system which looks at the resilience at

149
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,600
local level, how much you can do at the

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,800
local level but also how it is connected

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,800
to the outside forces. So for example,

152
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,520
we just had a conversation with the

153
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,600
visitors from Iceland and they said well

154
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,039
well we are doing a lot of good things.

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,639
They're blessed with a lot of good

156
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,919
resources but we are still uh subject to

157
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,160
the prices for wind equipments or solar

158
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,400
equipments or other things. And so it

159
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,199
means you also need to understand what

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,000
are the trajectories for all these other

161
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,204
things which you will use as an input to

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
resolve your uh energy uh resiliency.

163
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,599
[clears throat]

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,440
So there is another aspect on the

165
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
physical side. I'm not going to go too

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
much about the physical risks. So we are

167
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,800
doing a lot of studies on the physical

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,960
risk. Again the slides are going to be

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,120
available. There is a reference uh down

170
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,039
below where you can take a look and try

171
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,639
to understand what's our thinking. So

172
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,240
this is one of the projects which we are

173
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,840
doing for department of energy, US

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,599
department of energy where we are trying

175
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,280
to understand well how vulnerable is the

176
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,000
energy infrastructure in particular

177
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
cases. And so this particular study we

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,120
are applying to a port of South

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,080
Louisiana where we are trying to

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,720
understand how the major port which is a

181
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,120
connection of all a lot of agricultural

182
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
trade other things how that is going to

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,759
be affected by both the gradual changes

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,160
like sea level rise temperature change

185
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759
but also the extreme events and how all

186
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,520
that connected to other energy

187
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,319
infrastructure.

188
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,840
Okay. So switching gears back to the

189
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,919
story in terms of the emission

190
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,840
trajectories. So uh what I put here uh

191
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,919
are the latest projections from

192
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,080
international energy agency. So they

193
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,479
released their world energy outlook I

194
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,879
think last week or two weeks ago. Uh so

195
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,240
a couple things to note. Uh well one

196
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:16,000
thing to note that IAA uh returned back

197
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,919
their uh current policy scenario. Uh and

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
you can see the trajectories in current

199
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,120
policy scenario versus stated policy

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,879
scenario. and also uh they dropped

201
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,199
something which used to be called

202
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,080
announce pledges scenario. So those are

203
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,479
the long-term pledges for Paris

204
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,880
agreement. Those are not NDC. So NDCs

205
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,519
are still in their stated policies. But

206
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,159
if China for example is saying oh we are

207
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,000
going to be carbon neutral by60 or India

208
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,320
saying something like that that's in

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
announced pledges scenario and right now

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,640
kind of they're saying we are not sure

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
how to do about that. And so if you're

212
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,839
going to take a look at the latest world

213
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,640
energy outlook, you will see three

214
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,920
scenarios. Uh current policies, stated

215
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,040
policies, and net zero emissions. We at

216
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,040
our group at MIT doing our own outlooks.

217
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,399
And so you can see the trajectories of

218
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,920
the outlook which is going to be

219
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,920
released next week hopefully or uh after

220
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,480
the Thanksgiving. So it's almost ready

221
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,399
uh for the press and you will see uh how

222
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
we are thinking where the world is

223
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
going. So that's our current trend

224
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,440
scenario. We also try to understand okay

225
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,320
where this story with tariffs where we

226
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,920
try to impose Trump's tariffs. The

227
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
problem with that they constantly

228
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,720
changing. So it's not clear what number

229
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,200
to put and what is going to be the

230
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,519
reciprocal action and so on. So but the

231
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,640
point is take a look where we need to be

232
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,160
for net zero emission scenario where is

233
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,720
NZE and where are the realities. So

234
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,800
again, uh, when I'm in my festive mood,

235
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
typically I'm saying, well, that NZ

236
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,399
scenario, it's like Santa Claus

237
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,240
scenario. It's a wonderful world. It

238
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,800
would be nice if Santa Claus will come

239
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,160
and give us all these gifts, but I'm

240
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,800
getting older and older and I'm less and

241
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,120
less believing in Santa Claus. So it

242
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,440
means that we whenever we are making the

243
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,440
decisions we need to take a look where

244
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,399
the world is going how competitive we

245
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,200
are going to be where is our comparative

246
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:20,240
advantage under these conditions where

247
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,040
uh we are going to be uh trying to be uh

248
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,680
very competitive in the world and then

249
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,160
uh well uh people would throw picture

250
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,880
like that and so there are many many

251
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,800
versions of this type of a diagram uh

252
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,880
this one happens happens to be from IIA

253
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,600
geothermal and you see that it's a lot

254
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,399
of geothermal resource and you see that

255
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,160
almost invis invisible dashed line so

256
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
this is the current use of power

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,120
generation or current current power

258
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,360
capacity installed globally and kind of

259
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,880
immediately if you are an uninformed

260
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
person you will say oh what's the

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,480
problem why we are talking about fossil

262
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,760
fuels there are plenty of other stuff

263
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,720
which we can use so what why it's so

264
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,839
hard to do the shift to lowcarbon

265
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,040
resources

266
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,120
And well all these details this is where

267
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,360
uh all these grumpy economists come and

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,320
say well that's nice but it will cost

269
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,680
you much more money if you're what

270
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,240
trying to do this way and note that well

271
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,560
here uh I haven't mentioned uh nuclear

272
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,320
so these are the renewable resources and

273
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,360
so uh Charles uh has done a very good uh

274
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,600
application cases uh for nuclear and

275
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,880
indeed nuclear is very attractive if you

276
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,720
are going to take a look at the life

277
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,279
cycle emissions. Take a look at the

278
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
nuclear. It's very very attractive. But

279
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,760
also take a look at the cost, right? So

280
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,640
it's one of the most expensive options.

281
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,160
And well, these costs which are stated

282
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,440
there also quite optimistic. So if

283
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,600
you're going to take a look at that

284
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,399
diagram, you see that well according to

285
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:57,200
that document from IAA, uh well that's

286
00:11:52,399 --> 00:12:00,160
about $4,000 per kW electric. Uh well

287
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,160
the last uh two units and Charles can

288
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,519
correct me if I'm wrong which we built

289
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,600
in this country uh the waggle. So the

290
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:13,920
original price tag was $6,000 per kW.

291
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,800
The realized price is $16,000

292
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,800
per kW. So kind of whenever you're

293
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,120
talking about nuclear well that's not

294
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,120
really a cheap option uh at least in

295
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,040
this country. And if you're talking

296
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,519
about small modular reactors, you see

297
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,959
kind of in this diagram uh the current

298
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,959
question which we are getting many many

299
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,120
many times. Oh but SMRs are cheaper,

300
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,200
right? So let's build SMRs. Well, you

301
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,519
can do a very simple division kind of

302
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,680
the how much electricity you are going

303
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,399
to get from there for the cost and you

304
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,880
will get the very simple answer which

305
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,519
you cannot beat that well the big plant

306
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,760
are actually going to be much uh less

307
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,480
expensive. So again uh if you're going

308
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,040
to take a look at the uh for example uh

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,440
IAA projections for levelized cost which

310
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,440
they use in their projection you see the

311
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,000
costs which are listed there. So, and

312
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,079
for SMR, $8,500.

313
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,440
If you are going to take and follow the

314
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,680
news where the first commercial SMR is

315
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,639
currently being built in Canada,

316
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,040
Darlington, Gnova, and if you're going

317
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,800
to take a look the announced cost of the

318
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,959
first reactor, so they're thinking of

319
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,120
building four of them, you will end up

320
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,720
at the number $12,000 per KW. So, again,

321
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,800
they are not going to be cheap. So, it's

322
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,480
a good option. Well, it's a lot of

323
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,720
demand. It's a lot of demand from data

324
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
centers and hyperscalers and I provide

325
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,880
you some of the numbers for the current

326
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,480
capacity here in the US and well

327
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,240
estimated capacity is going to be

328
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,000
doubled by 2030 well almost 200 gawatt

329
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,800
so that's a sizable amount which is

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
needed just for data centers kind of but

331
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,360
there are many many other requirements

332
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
for uh the electricity [snorts] and I'm

333
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,560
not going to talk about too much about

334
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,399
nuclear batteries again if you have

335
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
questions well Charles colleagues know

336
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,079
much more about that concept fascinated

337
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,399
concept cept I'll have the picture at

338
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,199
the end of that and I'll I'll I'll make

339
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,040
some statements uh but also uh kind of

340
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,079
coming back to sustainability coming

341
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,920
back to realism so for example last week

342
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,760
I got this question so we work a lot of

343
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,680
the financial company asset management

344
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,959
company and one of the big investors

345
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,480
sent me a clip from the some Indian

346
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,079
newspaper which states oh look Chinese

347
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,360
are developing ship which will run on

348
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,560
thorium and that ship uh doesn't need

349
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,959
refueling and so that is going to put uh

350
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,279
the Chinese shipping uh at the

351
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,839
comparative advantage and so well kind

352
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,839
of that's kind of the worry for India

353
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,240
because well that also can be used in

354
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,240
nuclear submarines and so on and I've

355
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,839
started digging kind of to the story of

356
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,279
to thorium and kind of indeed uh it was

357
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,240
a successful uh announcement uh out of

358
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,839
China uh that they were converted to

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,760
uranium 233 Uh but well once you start

360
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,959
digging into the details looking at the

361
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,880
economics you start realizing that well

362
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,959
even the statement from that entity

363
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,839
which has done that successful test they

364
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,839
said oh the first demonstration plan is

365
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,680
expected to be like in 2035 and that the

366
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,880
first demonstration plan will have a

367
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,880
capacity of about 100 megawatt thermal.

368
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,839
So kind of which is 30 megawatt

369
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,639
electric.

370
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,519
You need all these kind of take kind of

371
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,279
all these grandio statements uh at the

372
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,959
granite of salt and try to understand

373
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,959
where's the reality how much difference

374
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,760
that indeed is going to make where

375
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,639
things are going to be uh going on uh

376
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,519
because well uh as you will hear uh

377
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,600
during the next presentation uh well by

378
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,920
that time we will be done the fusion so

379
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Dennis will tell you uh all about that

380
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,600
fusion uh is going to be commercial by

381
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,079
2040

382
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,480
uh I'm going to make some of the

383
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,079
comments. But again, be careful with my

384
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,920
comments. I already warned you. It's

385
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,480
like in the mirror, right? The objects

386
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,480
may appear closer than you think. So my

387
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,880
statements may appear more sarcastic

388
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,800
than the their reality are, but you

389
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,959
always need to kind of have a very good

390
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,000
dose of realism.

391
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,720
Okay. So how we do in addition to

392
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,279
telling nice stories and so this is kind

393
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,000
of the story how we put the numbers

394
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,920
behind our statements. uh we have the

395
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,680
model which is called the EPA model. So

396
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,040
if you're interested working with us, we

397
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,120
will be more than happy. We are working

398
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,279
with many many energy companies uh

399
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,759
financial companies, asset management,

400
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,680
other other companies where we try to

401
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,360
make this type of a projection. So I

402
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,279
showed you the outlook. Well, this is

403
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,600
the tool which we used in order to

404
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,320
produce the outlook and it captures a

405
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,079
lot of things and we use that for many

406
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,199
applications

407
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,440
and we are connecting that not only kind

408
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,160
of to the economic side but also to the

409
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,000
physical side where we see well what are

410
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,920
the impacts on the water use what are

411
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
the impacts on land use what the impacts

412
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,480
on air pollution what's the impact on

413
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,959
temperature sea level and vice versa how

414
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,439
that impacts the economics back so there

415
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,439
are many dimensions which we can try and

416
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,000
understand well both in terms of the

417
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,160
physical resilience but also in terms of

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
the transition risk which you may face

419
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,000
if you are trying to develop a strategy

420
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,199
for your particular country or your

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,319
particular company and so mostly what we

422
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,799
do we are doing this uh assessment of

423
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,559
future technologies so most of the work

424
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,559
which we do is we're trying to

425
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,280
understand okay what's the story with

426
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,520
direct air capture so is again picking

427
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,679
up on Iceland is that experience in

428
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,799
Iceland is representative or maybe they

429
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,679
have such a good uh uh geothermal

430
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,919
resource which makes this a unique cost

431
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,559
experiment uh which you cannot really

432
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,000
put uh into other locations. So if

433
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,720
you're going to put that into other

434
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,320
locations like Canada, well you needed a

435
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,240
lot of weathering and other things which

436
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,400
in Iceland well they don't really need

437
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,080
to do. So a lot of things like that

438
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,760
where we try to understand what's

439
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
realistic, what's not. How to

440
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,320
decarbonize hardtopate sector. So uh

441
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
Charles mentioned uh steel making well

442
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
we are doing trying to understand a lot

443
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,320
of pathways which are related to that.

444
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,400
So hydrogen sustainable aviation fuels

445
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,880
many things. So I wouldn't be able to

446
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,640
cover uh uh all of these topics but you

447
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
have my email there. You're going to

448
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
have slides if you are interested like

449
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,039
Charles we can send you tons of

450
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,960
references more than you will be able to

451
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
read but kind of that's the the work

452
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,679
which we are doing which we are

453
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,679
producing. So moving on uh data centers

454
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,440
that's the hot topic that's kind of the

455
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,640
question which we are getting right and

456
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,799
left what's the energy use and so kind

457
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,640
of this is our assessment again which we

458
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,240
are going to provide in our upcoming

459
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,080
outlook where you see well it's not true

460
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,280
it's quite sizable amount if you're

461
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,799
going to take a look at that number 3700

462
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,200
terowatt hours well that's the amount of

463
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,520
electricity generation currently in

464
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,760
Europe so basically you are going to

465
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,840
power data centers in the same amount

466
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,240
which you cover covering Europe not

467
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,320
European Union the whole Europe and so

468
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,799
kind of another point which is important

469
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,080
on this well where we currently see the

470
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,760
data centers is US and China and

471
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,840
immediately you're thinking about a lot

472
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,919
of geopolitics oh what about Europe what

473
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,400
about India what about other places and

474
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,840
again there are many many reasons why

475
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,080
that is happening but even more uh

476
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,320
important story how that is going to

477
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,120
affect the economy, how that is going to

478
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,120
affect the labor force. Are you going to

479
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,200
replace people or is it going to be

480
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,679
substitute? How productive you are going

481
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,280
to be? Where the productivity will be

482
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,600
increasing? Is it going to be in

483
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,240
services sectors in other sectors? So

484
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,720
there are still many questions which we

485
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
are still trying to answer. But well, no

486
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,360
matter how you look at that, the

487
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,760
requirement for energy from data centers

488
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,919
are going to be huge.

489
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,880
And it means that well if you want to

490
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,640
attract these hyperscalers offer them

491
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,559
stable and cheap prices and they will

492
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,039
come. They will be more than happy to

493
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,280
get to there. I'm not going to go too

494
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,120
much about uh these diagrams again

495
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,039
that's going to be publicly available in

496
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,600
a week or two. These are from our

497
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,679
outlook. One point which I want to make

498
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,240
take a look at the middle picture. It's

499
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,960
just India and China. And take a look at

500
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,520
that bar which is kind of the lowest bar

501
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,799
that's coal. And so the story when you

502
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,080
are trying to say you want to

503
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:31,280
decarbonize the world you want to have

504
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,280
net zero for the whole world you need to

505
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,720
solve that and that's a difficult

506
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,000
difficult task to do what to do about

507
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,400
coal just in two countries and so well

508
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,559
if they are not going to make progress

509
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,200
the overall progress is going to be much

510
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,360
much harder to achieve and this is our

511
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,760
story for accelerated actions where you

512
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,320
see that well that call is going down

513
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,320
much more renewables but all that will

514
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
come at a cost and so you're going to

515
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,240
reshape certain things you're going to

516
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,880
reshape other things. Another point is

517
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,120
the story for natural gas which is also

518
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,600
somewhat different in the rest of the

519
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,520
world between these two scenarios and we

520
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,679
have all these projections for our all

521
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,840
regions. So here I just put that for

522
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,919
three regions but kind of we are going

523
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,320
to release the data for uh all our

524
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,880
modeling regions but uh on the other

525
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,520
side the story for wind and solar for

526
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,679
renewables is bright regardless of the

527
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,240
scenario. So it means that most of that

528
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,120
is not driven by incentives a lot of

529
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,360
that is driven by economics but another

530
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,240
point even in the very aggressive

531
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,120
scenario it's not just wind and solar we

532
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,679
need other options for many many reasons

533
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,880
uh for global power generation

534
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,840
and then uh the important part whenever

535
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,520
you are talking about the

536
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,960
degarbonization

537
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,159
it's not just what governments can do

538
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,480
it's not just what companies can do.

539
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,520
It's also how you and I are going to

540
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,760
behave, how consumers are going to react

541
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,440
to these incentives. And this is very

542
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,760
important. What is our willingness to

543
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,760
pay? It's nice to talk about some

544
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,159
company which needs to decarbonize,

545
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,480
which needs to move to clean hydrogen or

546
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,159
something like that. And another point,

547
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,960
how much shall we willing to pay for

548
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,360
that? And here is the story. So kind of

549
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,320
very very nice story. uh you know the

550
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,600
name Mark Carney. He used to be the head

551
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,400
of Bank of Canada. When he was at the

552
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,360
Bank of Canada, he created something

553
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,080
which is called well carbon tax in

554
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,120
Canada. So he was behind kind of doing

555
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,559
that at the federal level. Then he moved

556
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,720
to Bank of England. In Bank of England

557
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,520
he created something which is called

558
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,400
NGFS network for greening financial

559
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,880
system. He was he made very powerful

560
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
speech why central banks needs to pay

561
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,559
attention to that. So he was behind that

562
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,760
and then he became the prime minister of

563
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,840
Canada on his first day on job which

564
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,240
happens to be April 1st. So those of you

565
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,799
who know the meaning of fool's day kind

566
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,919
of see the irony. What did he do on his

567
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,919
first day of job? He killed the carbon

568
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:18,400
tax in Canada. And so why? because we

569
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,080
are not doing very well in terms of

570
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,240
communicating

571
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,400
why we are doing that, how much

572
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,480
expensive these things are going to get

573
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,640
and where's the political support. He

574
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,799
didn't think that it's a bad idea

575
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,799
because he was behind all these

576
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,600
instruments but he has to deal with

577
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,000
political reality. So again the lesson

578
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,880
you need to know about the technologies

579
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,280
but you also need to understand how

580
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,240
people are going to react to all these

581
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,200
policies. Where is that fine line? And

582
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,679
the fine line in Canada, he killed the

583
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,080
consumerf facing carbon tax. He didn't

584
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,559
kill the industry carbon tax. And the

585
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,400
idea is well the consumers probably will

586
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,039
not realize that they are still paying.

587
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,880
It's just in very indirect way. So kind

588
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
of again the story is whenever you're

589
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,720
talking about how you want to

590
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,240
incentivize actions, you need to do

591
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,240
something like that. Why is that?

592
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,200
Because distributional impacts matter.

593
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,400
And so this is another uh area of the

594
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,120
research where we are trying to

595
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,720
understand how different income groups,

596
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
how different demographics, how

597
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,400
different regions are going to be

598
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,640
affected and that is the information for

599
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,200
support of actions, how you are going to

600
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,200
provide the incentives those who are the

601
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,159
most vulnerable.

602
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,640
And the answer to all of the

603
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,279
decarbonization may be different again

604
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,840
depending on what kind of industry

605
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,840
you're talking about uh and what kind of

606
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,720
fuel. So the I like this particular

607
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,960
diagram from the US government. Uh and

608
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,440
you can see that well US government can

609
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,600
be very useful for particular things at

610
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,159
least well to produce this very

611
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,480
informative diagram where kind of what

612
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,200
they try to do they try to put icons

613
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,240
well where do we see the answer which

614
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,400
kind of the fuel might be a good idea.

615
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,720
You also can see that well this is from

616
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,120
2023 and if you're going to take a look

617
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,799
at longhaul heavy duty trucks you see

618
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,520
that they were still quite optimistic

619
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,080
about hydrogen. I think if we we will do

620
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,640
it right now probably we will put one

621
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,279
more icon to battery and one less into

622
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,120
hydrogen but can again the story is

623
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,360
you're not going to have a solution

624
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,679
which fits all the needs. you really

625
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,480
need to understand where is the market

626
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,039
where you can apply and where you go and

627
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,960
especially kind of these R&D priorities.

628
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,039
Another interesting story about that

629
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,440
report which is listed there. So we have

630
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,360
done a study for sustainable aviation

631
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,440
fuels. It was done by uh kind of uh at

632
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,559
the request of Airbus and Latam

633
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,640
airlines. So the several countries in

634
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,640
Latin America. So Brazil currently has a

635
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,799
mandate for sustainable aviation fuels.

636
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,640
is it just transferred into law and kind

637
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,480
of there are some uh additional

638
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
information about that and so we have

639
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,799
done a study so I've spent a lot of time

640
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,120
in all of these capitals talking to a

641
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,400
lot of uh policy makers where we were

642
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,799
trying to educate what's the story

643
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,720
behind sustainabation fuels I did the

644
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,039
presentation when we released

645
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,159
preliminary results in the middle of

646
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,000
2024 and we showed the costs we showed

647
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,440
the feed stocks we showed the impact on

648
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,400
aviation and I got the reaction at the

649
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,240
meeting so had presented at at IATA at

650
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,760
IARE kind of major CEOs of airlines and

651
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,080
in middle of 2024 the reaction was no

652
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,960
probably you're too pessimistic no the

653
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,600
reality is much brighter so so yeah it

654
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,000
we will learn kind of cost will go down

655
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,559
I did exactly the same presentation in

656
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the middle of this year more or less to

657
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,080
exactly the same group and same numbers

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,240
I didn't change any number I showed

659
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,640
exactly the same thing and I got a

660
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,640
reaction. No, no, no, no. Sustainable

661
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,039
fuels is much much harder. No, you you

662
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,799
are too optimistic. So know the reality

663
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,440
because they start learning. They start

664
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,919
seeing how much that is cost and what

665
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,840
are the impacts. And you can see that

666
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,520
the perception is also changing for what

667
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,320
is doable, what is not doable in

668
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,320
particular industries. So couple of

669
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,400
concluding slides. I see that claus

670
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,480
already looking at me nervously kind of

671
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,440
that we need to finish. uh so it's many

672
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,400
applications where we need to understand

673
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,480
and that's why you don't really uh

674
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,320
looking at particular technology in

675
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,320
particular sector but you're trying to

676
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,720
understand what are the competitions

677
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,760
where are the synergies uh where are the

678
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,600
things uh where you can also use the

679
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,679
same learning and apply that into

680
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,919
different regions or different sectors.

681
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,960
So kind of many things uh and many

682
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,919
answers and many opportunities and again

683
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,000
to kind be a little bit more optimistic

684
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,399
and this is hopefully a nice segue to

685
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,039
Denny's presentation. So I'm not sure if

686
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,679
he's going to show this spark diagram.

687
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,240
Uh this is the plant which uh he and his

688
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,600
team is building uh very close by a

689
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,279
spark facility. uh and uh why uh I feel

690
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,080
like I can put this picture because we

691
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,360
have done a study where we uh did the uh

692
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,799
economic analysis uh what is the value

693
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,480
of fusion in the decarbonized system and

694
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,520
so we issued the report there is a

695
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,840
mighty report uh on the fusion uh but

696
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,919
also that report uh was liked by

697
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,720
international atomic energy agency they

698
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,720
said oh we want to have that chapter and

699
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,799
put it into our outlook so if you're

700
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,200
going to take a look at IA world fusion

701
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,520
outlook you will see that well they're

702
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,960
using our projections in terms of the

703
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,520
what would be the value of the fusion in

704
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,600
trying to decarbonize the society. The

705
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,880
picture uh on your right is that nuclear

706
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,760
battery. So again uh fascinating topic

707
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,559
uh kind of try to talk to our uh nuclear

708
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,799
uh department specialists uh again they

709
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,960
will talk to you probably endlessly for

710
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,520
many many hours. How good is this? And

711
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,919
then this last picture is another uh

712
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,760
good thing which we are trying to uh

713
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,159
also understand what's the economics of

714
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,240
that. So what I'm trying to kind of

715
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,440
represent there is natural gas

716
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,880
pyrolysis. So whenever you are producing

717
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,360
hydrogen through pyrolysis you have a

718
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,440
lot of solid carbon as a product. So you

719
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,360
don't really need capture CO2 in a

720
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,720
gaseous form but you have the solid

721
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,799
carbon. And so the story is can we find

722
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,240
a use for that solid carbon because if

723
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,880
you're really talking about hydrogen

724
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,720
production at scale you have too much

725
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,960
and you don't really know what to do

726
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,880
about that. And then this is these are

727
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,520
another uh things which we are trying to

728
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,000
understand is well how we change the

729
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,080
property that you can convert that into

730
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,520
construction material.

731
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,600
Well, then you're replacing the

732
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,159
traditional cement and reducing all the

733
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,080
emissions and which are associated with

734
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,720
processing and kind of producing of

735
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,120
cement. In addition to that, well, that

736
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,080
can serve as a battery. So, think of the

737
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,240
wall where you can charge your phone or

738
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,919
think of the parking lot where you can

739
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,440
charge your EV. So again a lot of things

740
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,720
which are none of projections currently

741
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,279
but which can be a gamecher and again uh

742
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,919
you need to understand well what are the

743
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,640
niches with whom you competing where you

744
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,440
are going and if we are going to get at

745
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,399
least one of these somewhere close to

746
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,200
the reality where we will be able to use

747
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,679
that in the near future. So then

748
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,720
hopefully we will be living in the world

749
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,720
like this. So where we have this

750
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,039
wonderful world where I'm pretty sure

751
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,559
one way or another we will have to get

752
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:53,120
to that world but I'm not sure where and

753
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:57,440
when because definitely not by 2050 but

754
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:00,880
the things otherwise will go much much

755
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,440
worse that the public the customers us

756
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,480
will require much more action and sooner

757
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,520
or later well all these aspects of

758
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,760
sustainability will have to come to the

759
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,799
same place where we are talk about

760
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,600
emission reductions where we talk about

761
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,480
making sure that we have secure systems

762
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,279
and making sure that we can afford that.

763
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,520
And so if we can merge all these goals

764
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,320
together, well that's where we are

765
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,480
trying to quantify what it would take,

766
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,000
what is the cost, what are the actions,

767
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,960
what are the incentives and you are here

768
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,600
well creating all these pathways. So if

769
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,919
you have wonderful technologies which

770
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,559
you want to test and try to see how that

771
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,320
is going to fit the picture, well please

772
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,960
contact us and we will be more than

773
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,656
happy to address them. Here I'll stop.

774
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,676
Thank you.

775
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:52,676
>> [applause]

776
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,559
>> WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SERGE. Is

777
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,200
there Sergey? Is there any questions to

778
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,600
this? Because this is quite an

779
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,600
incredible picture.

780
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:12,799
Ah, Charles, you don't need a mic. No

781
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,799
question. Last year, China

782
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,240
hours,

783
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:22,320
US four, Europe 2.4.

784
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,480
DNS at an incredible rate of China's

785
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,480
virtually all energy technologies in

786
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,600
terms of deployment. Does anything the

787
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,279
west do except technologies have any

788
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,360
impact

789
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,840
on carbon dioxide emissions because

790
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,919
there's a 900 lb gorilla over there and

791
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,600
everybody else is down here. I know

792
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,679
that's a very politely incorrect

793
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,840
question but every time I go check I

794
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,799
remind you of this.

795
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,120
Well, so you are exactly right and so

796
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,399
that diagram shows that if we're really

797
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,760
serious about the global action, if we

798
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,880
are not successful with making sure that

799
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,519
China and India are moving much faster

800
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,320
than what they are currently doing, uh

801
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,480
that's why those trajectories are still

802
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,279
sticking. And so yeah, Europe can

803
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,519
decarbonize to zero, but if the rest of

804
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,760
not just China and India, well think of

805
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,080
Africa while they're still lacking

806
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,600
access to energy in many places and it's

807
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,080
still a question what kind of energy

808
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,480
they are going to get. Southeast Asia.

809
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,120
So most of the natural gas actually

810
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,360
projected to be used in Southeast Asia.

811
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,039
So because well these are the mark these

812
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,120
the market. So coming back uh where the

813
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,640
optimism you mentioned that China is

814
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,640
leading in all the technologies they're

815
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,360
also leading in clean technologies right

816
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,480
so again we can question what is the

817
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,159
real incentives but they are pushing all

818
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,919
these alternative technologies where

819
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,399
they're saying to the rest of the world

820
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,600
well you were fantastic in producing

821
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:55,760
your Mercedes and Audi's look but our

822
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,440
BYD is much better car and so this is

823
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,200
much more sustainable and they are

824
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,679
beating They're competing they out

825
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,320
competing many places where we see that

826
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,720
is happening and name oh you mentioned

827
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,320
nuclear right so you mentioned kind of

828
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,119
uh carbon capture you mentioned uh wind

829
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,280
solar well traditional things so a lot

830
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,560
of things which are going to be driven

831
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,960
by China uh China is actually very easy

832
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,399
country to project at the same time it's

833
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,520
very difficult country to project why

834
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,679
it's easy read their fiveyear plan you

835
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,440
know what they are going to do why it's

836
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,960
difficult because after five years you

837
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,440
don't know what they're going to do and

838
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,119
so kind of we kind of know where they're

839
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,320
going we know their story we know the

840
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:42,320
reasons uh but I fully agree uh the

841
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,040
story where US where Europe might

842
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,079
influence things in a big way is again

843
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,000
coming back to data centers how AI is

844
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,079
going to play in this thing is the hype

845
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,639
who knows at this point there are many

846
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,960
questions about that but if that is

847
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,280
going to change things in if what is

848
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,400
going to change things in the big way is

849
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,839
where we are going to go with artificial

850
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,720
intelligence and how we are going to

851
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:13,400
apply that for the economic purposes.

852
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,400
>> Super. Any other questions?

853
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,920
And I have a very loaded question. So I

854
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,079
mean when I look at your slides there

855
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,280
seems to be an urgency really to act.

856
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,200
Why are nobody is moving in that and has

857
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,680
the urgency to move forward?

858
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,400
>> Well, very simple answer because

859
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,400
whatever alternative

860
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,960
typically it cost more money.

861
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,280
>> Mhm.

862
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:43,200
>> And so we all do not like pay more.

863
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,280
That's again that's why unless uh Dennis

864
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,119
is going to be very very successful in

865
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,839
very cheap fusion and sorry for picking

866
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,680
up on Dennis many many times but well

867
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,280
the kind of it's a enormous weight on

868
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,400
your shoulders to provide cheap

869
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,000
electricity to the world and so this

870
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,920
type of the breakthrough where you are

871
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,119
going to provide similar service or even

872
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,280
better service at a cheaper price that's

873
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,200
where we can see where we are going to

874
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,079
move much much quickly. Okay.

875
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,240
>> And otherwise well we are talking to

876
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,800
like governments in Africa, Latin

877
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,560
America and others they say yeah we care

878
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,240
about the emission reduction we care

879
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,480
about climate change we want to do

880
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,119
something but there are 15 other

881
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,359
priorities which are on our agenda. So

882
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,640
we need to make sure that's why it's

883
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,320
sustainable. It's not only about

884
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,079
climate. You need to provide a

885
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,040
sustainable answer to uh this d the kind

886
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,480
of

887
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,880
>> re really really uh important topic and

888
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,800
uh it doesn't help that the current

889
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,599
attitude from the current administration

890
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,760
is changing the dynamics quite

891
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,920
dramatically.

892
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,800
>> Yeah. So you mentioned the last slide

893
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,160
that we have conductive self eating

894
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,040
cement. Yeah.

895
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,680
>> When do you think we might be able to

896
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,839
solution available to scale up?

897
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,640
>> Well, I'm not going to name a company

898
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,200
name. So, currently we have a project

899
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,119
where uh they produced that carbon

900
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,640
block. Uh it's tested here at MIT. Uh we

901
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,480
are trying to understand the properties.

902
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,400
We are trying to understand how useful

903
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,960
again this is still at a very very small

904
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,839
scale. And the same story what Charles

905
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,839
is saying well kind of realistically if

906
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,200
you have something something in a lab

907
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,160
and when you have the full scale uh

908
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,440
industry it's at least 10 15 years at

909
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,000
least. So that's when we might see

910
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,400
