1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,199
right, we'll get started. Um, we're

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,840
going to continue our discussion of

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,519
principal components analysis.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,080
And what I want to uh emphasize with

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,640
principal components is that we're

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:35,600
dealing with a random vector x

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:39,120
that's in m dimensional space

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,200
and it has an expected value

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,360
of

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:50,239
alpha say and it has a covariance matrix

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,800
given by sigma

13
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,680
which is m by m.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:02,559
Okay, this kind of setup uh can be used

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,119
for modeling returns on stocks or assets

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,159
that may have a mean return over some

17
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,680
holding period and a variance covariance

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,119
matrix.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,439
And so um in working with financial

20
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,000
data, principal components analysis can

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:26,240
be quite useful. Um essentially what

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,880
principal components does is it

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,280
transforms

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,520
our x vector to a p vector of principal

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,520
component variables.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:45,439
And the definitions of these is

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,840
we subtract from X the mean vector

28
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,880
and then we

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:58,000
rotate the coordinate axes

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:00,479
of this M vector by this gamma uh

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,880
transpose

32
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:09,200
uh matrix.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,720
And so um this gamma transpose

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,879
can equal gamma 1 transpose gamma 2

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,480
transpose down to gamma m transpose.

36
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:25,760
And so the first component

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:30,720
um P1 down to PM the first component

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:35,040
corresponds to using this uh gamma

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:39,680
vector which happens to be an igen

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,879
vector of the covariance matrix

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,560
corresponding to where with associated

42
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,640
igen value lambda I and in this

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:55,519
representation.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:59,840
Um we uh basically have sigma gamma i is

45
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,000
equal to lambda i gamma i.

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,519
Uh and

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,519
we can order our ien values

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,000
from largest to smallest.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
And the first principal component

50
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
variable

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
corresponds to

52
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,440
lining up or looking at a coordinate

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
system where we're looking along the

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,959
dimension of greatest variability in the

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,680
data. So um so this

56
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,200
sort of covariant structure it's

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,959
actually useful to think of a special

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
example

59
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,560
which is the multivariant normal

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,000
distribution in m dimensions with mean

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,319
vector alpha and covariance matrix

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,879
sigma.

63
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,400
And so

64
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,360
if we think of X1 and X2, we'll just

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,280
consider a two-dimensional case as an

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:10,560
example. There could be an alpha one,

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:13,360
alpha 2 here for the mean of X1, first

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:19,280
component mean of X2.

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:24,400
And with a bariate normal distribution

70
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:29,680
the uh we basically will have contours

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:34,479
of the density the joint density of x1

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:38,880
and x2 that are given by ellipses

73
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:42,160
centered at the mean vector and the

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,400
degree to which the components are

75
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,240
highly correlated ated. If it's a

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,320
positive correlation, then we have

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
ellipses that are tilted up. If it's a

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,560
negative correlation, it would be tilted

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:01,759
down. Now, um what principal components

80
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:06,320
analysis does is it basically

81
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:10,639
this step here corresponds to shifting

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:16,560
the coordinate axes to say x1 star and

83
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:19,280
x2 star. So we reenter our space at the

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,440
point with the origin being at the mean

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,120
point of the outcomes. And then we

86
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
consider

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,680
rotating these axes

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,639
in such a way that

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,080
the first principal component axis with

90
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:43,199
the largest corresponding to the largest

91
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:48,160
value. Um it will orient along the

92
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:52,400
principal axis of the ellipse.

93
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,840
And the second principal component

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,560
axis will be orthogonal

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,120
to the first

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,440
and it will um well in two dimensions it

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,440
will you know have variability along

98
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,440
that dimension that's that's smaller

99
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,080
than P1 when we extend from a

100
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,759
two-dimensional case to an M dimensional

101
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,120
case.

102
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,960
So suppose we have 500 stocks or a

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,000
thousand um then if we apply a

104
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,280
multinnormal model to those to that case

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,880
then our principal components will be

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,919
identifying

107
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,759
uh coordinates

108
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,639
basically coordinate um system variables

109
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,919
that line up with

110
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,520
different orthogonal dimensions of

111
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,199
variability.

112
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,199
And so what's ends up being very useful

113
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:57,680
is that um at least when we look at a

114
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,759
market of stocks or asset returns

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,720
um some of those may be highly

116
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,680
correlated with each other. Others may

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,560
be in a sense orthogonal or uncorrelated

118
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,800
with each other. And with principal

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
components analysis, we can actually

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,039
identify

121
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:22,000
uh we can identify different directions

122
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,880
in the space which uh basically have

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
decreasing levels of variability but

124
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,199
that are also orthogonal to each other

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,639
or uncorrelated with each other. So when

126
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,479
we want to specify

127
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,960
factors underlying factors say in joint

128
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,039
distributions of returns and markets

129
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,720
principal components can be very helpful

130
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,080
and trying to identify those and later

131
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,919
on we'll talk about factor modeling and

132
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,120
see how uh close or how effective

133
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,560
principal components can be. um and uh

134
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,319
but there are also general factor models

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:09,520
that that we'll introduce later. So with

136
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:13,520
these transformations as noted here um

137
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:17,199
these principal component variables have

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:22,000
basically a mean that's zero and a

139
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,319
co-variance matrix that's diagonal.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,080
So these principal component variables

141
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,120
are uncorrelated with each other. And if

142
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,680
we order the igen values from largest to

143
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,959
smallest, the first principal component

144
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,560
uh variable will be the uh sort of axis

145
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:44,159
with the greatest variability. Now

146
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,880
what's interesting to highlight is that

147
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,640
in the transformation from the original

148
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,839
x's to the principal component variables

149
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
the only thing we've done is shift the

150
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,760
origin

151
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,760
and then rotated

152
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,880
the coordinate axes in an orthogonal

153
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,320
way. So we're maintaining

154
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,680
right angles between coordinate axes

155
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,959
and that's all we've done. So, so if we

156
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,279
have outcomes

157
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,040
of X,

158
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,959
so if we have X is a random variable,

159
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,600
but then we may have realizations

160
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,839
realization say

161
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:35,519
X I don't know a XB. I don't want to

162
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,279
have integers uh referring to these

163
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
because I don't want to confuse the

164
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,839
components. But we could have different

165
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,720
realizations for different days

166
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,360
or different analysis periods and we

167
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,399
would get different points of

168
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,200
realizations of the outcomes of this

169
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:01,279
vector. And so principal components

170
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,120
allows us just to view the data in a way

171
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,680
that hasn't

172
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,519
um transformed the data in an unusual

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,000
way. basically the configuration of

174
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,800
points is the same before and after uh

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,640
the construction of these uh PC

176
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:25,200
variables. So um

177
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,279
let's see okay there's uh this sort of

178
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,360
version of principal components where we

179
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:34,079
consider splitting the first k

180
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,519
principal components into uh sort of a

181
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:42,000
gamma one matrix and uh the remaining

182
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:45,040
ones into a gamma 2 uh portion. And so

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,480
one can then think of there being a

184
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:55,440
linear model for our outcome X variable

185
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:59,519
which might be simplified to just a mean

186
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,519
vector plus a matrix

187
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,959
times

188
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:09,440
the first K principal component

189
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:13,760
variables plus error. Um, if this in

190
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,880
fact were sort of an effective model,

191
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,880
um, you know, it might be the case that

192
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,680
the last M minus K principal component

193
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,279
variables essentially have no important

194
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:32,560
information in them. And so this could

195
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:37,440
be a very simple model for our uh, X

196
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,360
variable. And importantly the if this

197
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,240
were the

198
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:48,959
mo an appropriate model for an M vector

199
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:52,800
X then the co-variance matrix of the uh

200
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:57,839
the coariance matrix of X

201
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,800
um is just given by uh

202
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:05,040
or or let's see or the yeah the the

203
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,360
coariance matrix of X in terms of the

204
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,800
off diagonal entries which represent the

205
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,200
correlations are all due to common

206
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,320
loadings on these different principal

207
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,959
component variables in P1. So the

208
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:25,680
interesting question to uh think about

209
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:29,760
is you know how can we model

210
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,720
uh random vectors with some covariance

211
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,519
matrix and are there simple structures

212
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,000
to the covariance matrix that explain

213
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,000
all of the intercorrelations.

214
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:48,480
Uh now when we uh perform

215
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:54,720
empirical principal components analysis

216
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,880
then what we do is we say we have an x

217
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,639
uh matrix

218
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,639
which has columns x1 through x sub

219
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,800
capital t that are all m vectors. Then

220
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:14,160
we compute the row means

221
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:18,560
um we subtract those row means from uh

222
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:23,360
the uh from the matrix row by row and

223
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:26,079
then with this xstar matrix that's the

224
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,320
demeaned matrix

225
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:35,600
that matrix times its transpose

226
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,920
divided by the number of columns in X

227
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,200
capital T that is an estimate of the

228
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:46,560
coariance matrix essentially the sample

229
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:49,519
coariance matrix and we then can perform

230
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,279
an Igen value vector decomposition of

231
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,680
this coariance matrix and then use these

232
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,079
results to define

233
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,040
um the empirical principal component uh

234
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,720
coordinates of our data and it

235
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,920
corresponds responds to just taking our

236
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,720
estimate of the gamma matrix transpose

237
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,120
the demean matrix. So this is very

238
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,639
simple to implement

239
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,760
um

240
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,680
and let's see there the singular value

241
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,839
decomposition

242
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,720
um is also uh a way of obtaining these

243
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,399
principal uh component uh

244
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,880
transformations.

245
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:38,079
If we look at v durpose being the

246
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:43,760
singular value decomposition of our

247
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:48,079
xstar demeaned matrix. Then um

248
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:52,079
we have our lambda

249
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,199
estimate just being the square of the d

250
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,680
diagonal matrix divided by t. The

251
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,480
estimate of the gamma matrix is simply

252
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,760
the v. and our principal component

253
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,000
variables or our data transformed to

254
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:14,560
principal component coordinates is

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,560
simply given by d u prime. So um

256
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,399
principal components analysis is very

257
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,560
easy to implement and the lecture that

258
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,360
was originally scheduled for today uh

259
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,079
Stefan Andrev um he's going to go

260
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,959
through a number of examples of applying

261
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:35,920
principal components in uh equity

262
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:41,680
markets and in uh bond markets. What's

263
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:44,800
really useful to anticipate is that

264
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,240
um well one of the examples that he's

265
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,440
used in the past is where the X vector

266
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,800
corresponds to index returns in

267
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,560
different European markets on a daily

268
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,560
basis

269
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,199
and

270
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,639
attempting to understand

271
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,040
sort of the joint variability across all

272
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,440
of the markets. markets, but also to

273
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,839
understand where there are sort of

274
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,320
different geographical

275
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,240
um clusters of uh countries like

276
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,480
northern European versus southern

277
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:26,160
European those tend to uh be separately

278
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,560
highly correlated with each other. Um

279
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,560
another example of principal components

280
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,639
analysis is looking at interest rates

281
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:40,240
in uh the fixed income market. Uh it

282
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,399
turns out that for different maturities

283
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:48,639
of bonds ranging from say one month,

284
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:52,079
three month a year to uh five years, 10

285
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,160
years, 20 years, 30 years. The interest

286
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,959
rates

287
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:04,559
can be uh uh measured in terms of their

288
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:07,919
yields and the yield curve will vary day

289
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,120
by day. And it turns out that uh the

290
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:16,400
principal components analysis of yields

291
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,760
um is uh has a very strong uh structure

292
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,120
to it.

293
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,600
um the uh so uh I'll let him introduce

294
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,760
those when he when he comes in a couple

295
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,760
of weeks. All right. Well, um with

296
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,840
principal component variables, it's

297
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
important to

298
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,120
understand

299
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,520
uh that there are alternative ways of

300
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,760
deriving or defining principal component

301
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,400
variables. One is to define the first

302
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,880
principal component variable to be the

303
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:55,120
linear combination

304
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:58,960
defined by weights W1 through WM

305
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,240
that maximize the variance of that

306
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,440
weighted sum subject to the sum of

307
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,880
squares of the weights equaling one. So

308
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,799
we're looking at a unit vector

309
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,640
W

310
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:18,720
and trying to find the

311
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:23,919
vector W that maximizes

312
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:29,520
the u variance of the linear combination

313
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:33,120
in that direction. So um when we get to

314
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,880
sort of the transformation of the data

315
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,640
u or the random variable by demeaning it

316
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,720
then if we look at

317
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,880
w vectors that are unit vectors

318
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,400
in this space

319
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,679
then we're looking at which sort of w

320
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,960
vector is pointing in the direction of

321
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,200
maximum variability. ability. Then the

322
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,120
second principal component variable is

323
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:08,240
defined as the next

324
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,080
W vector now V which maximizes the

325
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,200
variance subject to having length one

326
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,600
but being orthogonal to the first.

327
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,360
So you know it's a rather nice way of uh

328
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,120
characterizing principal component

329
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,400
variables. Now, um, with principal

330
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,520
components analysis, one of the really

331
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,799
neat things is that,

332
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,160
let's see, we often focus on the first

333
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,520
few principal component variables

334
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,039
because they explain most of the

335
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
variability.

336
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:44,240
But the last principal component

337
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,559
variable is defines the linear

338
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,880
combination of the components that has

339
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,360
the smallest variance.

340
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,799
And sometimes that smallest variance can

341
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,799
be zero in which case we're identifying

342
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:03,840
sort of a linear dependence in the uh in

343
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:08,640
the return. So um let's see my first

344
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:12,160
sort of example uh of this case was uh

345
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:17,679
before the euro existed. So I'm really

346
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:19,919
dating myself. U but the uh German uh

347
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,720
Deutsch mark and the French Frank were

348
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,840
very very highly correlated uh before

349
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,000
the euro came out and in looking at

350
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,000
currency returns

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,240
um the principal components analysis

352
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,080
actually sort of identified that

353
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:40,880
empirically in a nice way. All right. Um

354
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,919
let's see. Okay. Mathematically

355
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,600
with um

356
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,840
principal components analysis we can

357
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,320
talk about a decomposition

358
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,840
of the total variance. So if we have

359
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,400
this covariance matrix sigma we could

360
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:03,280
talk about the total variance

361
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:07,520
is equal to the sum one to m of sigma i

362
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,000
jj. So the J diagonal

363
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,039
entry of the coariance matrix is the

364
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:19,440
variance of the J component

365
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:21,440
and the sum of that is the trace of

366
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:27,600
sigma.

367
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:31,679
um we can decompose that total variance

368
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:35,360
as the sum of the igen values.

369
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:41,520
And so uh principal components analysis

370
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,840
provides a decomposition of variability

371
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,280
and we can see sort of what proportion

372
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,760
of variability is explained by the first

373
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,679
or the first few principal component

374
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,240
variables.

375
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,440
All right. Um these lecture notes uh

376
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,520
finish with just reminding you of some

377
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,480
important statistic or dist important

378
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,400
probability distributions in statistics.

379
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,280
Um

380
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,799
the ki squared distribution arises again

381
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,280
and again and the ki squared

382
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,360
distribution with one degree of freedom

383
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,760
is

384
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,559
equal in distribution to the square of a

385
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:28,640
standard normal distribution.

386
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:32,159
So this is a useful thing to remember um

387
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,799
in different cases. Um and uh let's see

388
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,159
if we uh

389
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,240
well here's its density function. Um it

390
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,400
turns out to be a special case of the

391
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,520
gamma distribution

392
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,440
and uh here's this moment generating

393
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,000
function. It turns out that if we um

394
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
take independent

395
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
normal

396
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,200
01 random variables, square them and sum

397
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,960
them, then the sum of n independent ones

398
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,960
is a kai squared with n degrees of

399
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,919
freedom

400
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,400
and we can prove these results uh using

401
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:13,039
moment generating functions and get

402
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:18,159
densities for those. Um importantly, uh

403
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:23,600
t distributions often are um

404
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:26,320
uh let's see arise especially in the

405
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,159
study of a regression models and the

406
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,600
significance of regression parameter

407
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,360
estimates. Um but basically with a t

408
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,880
distribution

409
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,400
um if we take a standard normal

410
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,360
and then divide it by the square root of

411
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,760
a ki^ 2 divided by its degrees of

412
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,080
freedom where the ki squared variable u

413
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,559
is independent then this will give us a

414
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,679
t distribution with our degrees of

415
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:04,880
freedom. And so uh

416
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:08,480
let's see with t distributions um

417
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,480
t distributions are examples of

418
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,919
distributions that are heavier tailed

419
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,520
than a normal distribution.

420
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,960
And so if you think of

421
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:25,039
taking a normal Z variable and dividing

422
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,600
by this ki squared distribution divided

423
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,559
by its degree of freedom

424
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,400
and square root we're basically dividing

425
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:38,320
a random normal by something that's

426
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:42,640
random but around one.

427
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,120
and uh the randomness of that factor

428
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,360
leads to greater variability than the

429
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:52,400
normal. So it's sort of obvious that

430
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:58,960
that could be the case and it's u indeed

431
00:24:52,400 --> 00:25:04,159
uh true. Um and uh let's see uh the F

432
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,919
distribution turns out to be the ratio

433
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,000
of two kaiquare distributions each

434
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:15,679
divided by their respective degrees of

435
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,520
freedom. And in uh classical statistics,

436
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:23,919
we often are interested in measuring

437
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:28,880
variability of data and variability due

438
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:32,559
to different driving factors. And so F

439
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:36,559
distributions arise commonly when we

440
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,520
have estimates of variance um given by a

441
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,000
ki squar divided by a degree of freedom.

442
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:48,080
And if we have two different estimates

443
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,640
of variability, um then uh if those

444
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,080
distributions sort of have common

445
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,679
variances, then the uh F distribution

446
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,120
applies.

447
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,960
Um some of you may have heard of uh

448
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,200
analysis of variance in statistics.

449
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,720
Anyway, the analysis of variance methods

450
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,640
work with studying uh f statistic

451
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
distributions.

452
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,159
Yeah.

453
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,240
>> Are nonentral distributions used a lot?

454
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,159
Or is that are they mainly just like the

455
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
centered ones? Well, the uh

456
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,799
non-entrality

457
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:30,960
um or when you have null hypotheses in

458
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:34,640
analysis of variance that are true then

459
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,320
the F statistics will sort of be be fs

460
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:43,120
with zero non-entrality and if the null

461
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,679
hypothesis is false then um you'll have

462
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,600
a F distribution with a non-entrality

463
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:52,559
parameter. So the non-entrality

464
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,440
uh parameter comes into specifying the

465
00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:00,240
distribution of the test statistic

466
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,000
when the null hypothesis is false. So

467
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,679
>> is that used sometimes then like when

468
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,760
when the ho is false?

469
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:10,159
>> Yes. Um the uh actually uh the next two

470
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,480
lectures after today will be on

471
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,960
regression analysis

472
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,760
and testing in regression and so we'll

473
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,880
see those come into play there.

474
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,600
>> Yeah. Um

475
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,520
all right. Um what else? Oh, okay. Just

476
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,360
the weak law of large numbers and the

477
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,279
central limit theorem are the remaining

478
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,679
topics here. Um

479
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:41,440
if we have

480
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:45,440
sample data um realizations of say n um

481
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,279
or n realizations of a random variable

482
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,679
and here we say iid for independent and

483
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,320
identically distributed.

484
00:27:51,679 --> 00:28:00,399
um if those random variables have mean,

485
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:04,159
meu and variance sigma squared, then

486
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:07,200
the sample mean xbar

487
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:11,360
will converge in probability to that

488
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,799
mean. So the larger the sample size

489
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:19,919
in the mean, the closer the sample mean

490
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:22,799
will be to the uh true mew parameter.

491
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,480
But what we what's important from

492
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,279
probability theory is how do we

493
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,799
characterize convergence of random

494
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,600
variables. And so the convergence in

495
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,679
probability to a constant

496
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,399
means that the probability that the

497
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,960
deviation the absolute deviation from mu

498
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,720
exceeding epsilon that that goes to

499
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,840
zero.

500
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:53,840
And um this theorem or this result can

501
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:59,520
be proven with chbbyev's inequality.

502
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:01,039
And uh it's sort of a neat example um

503
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,399
where

504
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:08,080
if we want to look at the variance of

505
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,399
xar n

506
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:15,919
which is equal to what the expected

507
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,919
value of xar n minus mu uh

508
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,159
squared.

509
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,320
Then

510
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,279
if we were to draw

511
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,440
sort of xar n

512
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,760
and here's mu

513
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,279
and then have the graph of xar n minus

514
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,960
mu

515
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,840
squared.

516
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,640
If we were to transform our scale to xar

517
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,559
n minus mu,

518
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,919
then this

519
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:53,760
mu value goes to zero.

520
00:29:49,919 --> 00:30:01,039
And if we were to look at

521
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:04,720
um the epsilon value for xar n minus mu

522
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:08,880
um we can consider

523
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,919
a function other than this parabola

524
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,520
which is zero

525
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:21,039
up to this epsilon away from mu point

526
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:24,039
and then is simply equal to epsilon

527
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,039
squared

528
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:31,039
beyond and do the same at minus epsilon.

529
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
So zero up to there

530
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,760
and

531
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,640
the variance which is the probability

532
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,720
weighted average of the parabola over

533
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,919
the distribution

534
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:50,320
has to be greater than epsilon squar

535
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,799
times the probability of exceeding

536
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,120
of being further away from u than

537
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,640
epsilon. So the fact that this function

538
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,799
um

539
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,200
is greater than or equal to epsilon^ 2

540
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:08,159
times probability that xar n minus mu is

541
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:14,640
greater than epsilon.

542
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:18,640
This gives us uh the result and um

543
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,559
we basically have um that we're

544
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:25,360
basically

545
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:28,640
giving a positive bound for

546
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,799
for this uh

547
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,520
or we have an upper bound that decreases

548
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:38,679
with n for this uh probability. So that

549
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,679
gives us our nice result. Um

550
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,600
let's see if you really like probability

551
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,720
theory um

552
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:50,559
one can actually extend this result to

553
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,799
the case where um we don't have a

554
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,399
variance existing we just have a mean

555
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,760
existing

556
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:01,519
and that's a rather strong result that's

557
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,080
uh that's neat um at least it's neat in

558
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:09,039
terms of how the mathematics can uh

559
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:11,120
handle um more complex cases. Now

560
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,039
finally we have the central limit

561
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:18,080
theorem

562
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:22,240
which uh tells us what the asmtoic

563
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:26,240
distribution is of a

564
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,960
sum of independent and identically

565
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:34,080
distributed random variables is. And so

566
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,159
if we have

567
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,559
variables x1 to xn that are mean zero

568
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,799
variance sigma squared,

569
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:48,320
it turns out that the

570
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:52,640
sum of the x i divided by the square

571
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,679
root of the sample size uh converges to

572
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:01,600
a normal distribution with mean zero and

573
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:05,760
variance sigma squared. So um so we have

574
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:09,919
what zn equaling 1 / roo<unk> n sum 1 to

575
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,960
n of the x size converges to a normal

576
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:18,080
mean zero and variance sigma squared.

577
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:20,640
And if we were to think of um

578
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,919
xbar

579
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:28,240
which is equal to 1 /<unk> n * zn

580
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,399
this basically is converging in some

581
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,840
sense to a normal with mean zero and

582
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,559
variance sigma squar over n. Now, I put

583
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,039
quotes around this

584
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,000
arrow here because

585
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,480
it's not really legitimate to talk about

586
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,480
a limiting distribution

587
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:54,080
that depends on n. But this is sort of

588
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,159
the way the um

589
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,559
this is the way we approximate the

590
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,159
distributions of sample means. basically

591
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,480
they converge to the mean of the

592
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,760
distribution in this case zero and the

593
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,599
variance is sigma squar over n. Now

594
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:15,520
what's neat in this proof is just to

595
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,599
highlight the use of moment generating

596
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,560
functions.

597
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,800
And so if we say let's calculate the

598
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,119
moment generating function of ZN,

599
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,599
we're going to show that the moment

600
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,800
generating function of ZN converges to

601
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,000
this moment generating function, which

602
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,320
in fact is the normal with mean zero and

603
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,040
variance sigma squared. So the theorem

604
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,399
that says moment generating functions

605
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,159
are sort of unique and if the limit of

606
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:52,639
moment generating functions um exists

607
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,280
and equals some function we can identify

608
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,839
the distribution by that limiting moment

609
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,560
generating function. Well, if we

610
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:05,760
calculate just the moment generating

611
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:08,400
function of ZN, we just plug in ZN

612
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,720
within the expectation.

613
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:15,599
Then noting that the X's are independent

614
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,359
of each other. We basically are taking

615
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,680
the expectation of a product of

616
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,720
independent terms.

617
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,680
And so that expectation of a product is

618
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,839
the product of the expectations.

619
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:37,040
So we have the product of the expected

620
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:39,440
value of x i * t over root n. And this

621
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,240
expectation here is actually the moment

622
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:48,800
generating function of x

623
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:51,839
evaluated at t over root n.

624
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,320
So it's the nth power of that when we

625
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:59,119
take the product of all n of those. Now

626
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,839
this is where it gets interesting.

627
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,640
If we look at our moment generating

628
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,880
function of t over root n, well we don't

629
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,359
really know much about the distribution

630
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,160
of the x's. We know it has a mean. We

631
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,359
know it has a variance. The mean is

632
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,640
zero. The variance is sigma squared. If

633
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:27,839
we expand the moment generating function

634
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:31,359
into a tailaylor series, then we get 1 +

635
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:36,800
the expected value of x * t / roo<unk> n

636
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:41,680
plus the expected value of x^2 time / 2

637
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:45,680
* t / roo<unk> n^2 + an order term that

638
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,880
is given by the third power of the

639
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,240
argument.

640
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:56,560
And so as n gets large these higher

641
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:01,599
order terms are of smaller order. And so

642
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:05,920
we finally have that this in the limit

643
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:11,760
is 1 + this multiple over n plus a small

644
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:15,599
o of t ^2 / n. And if we take this

645
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,520
expression to the nth power,

646
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:29,520
then it converges to the exponent

647
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:35,119
of the argument sigma^ 2 t ^2 / 2. So um

648
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:42,720
let's see if we have 1 + r

649
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:49,000
let's see 1 + r / n to the n power

650
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,000
um this converges to e to the r

651
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:57,040
and villi used this argument

652
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,839
uh in the first lecture to talk about

653
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,079
sort of continuous compounding and what

654
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,320
the limiting value is of uh continuous

655
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,880
compounding at some interest rate.

656
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:14,160
Anyway, that same exponential

657
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,520
result is true here. So this actually

658
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,200
proves the central limit theorem using

659
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,240
uh the identity theorem for MGFS. Yeah.

660
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,720
>> Is is CLT actually used in practice

661
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,440
because obviously And like in finance,

662
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,040
nothing's going to be IID or at least

663
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,359
they're not going to be independent. So

664
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,960
like is it actually still useful in a

665
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,839
practical setting?

666
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,200
>> It it can be very useful in a practical

667
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,920
setting and it right now it's specified

668
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,280
in terms of

669
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:52,160
identically distributed X's. um it

670
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:57,440
actually generalizes to um x's that are

671
00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:02,160
uh independent but with um different uh

672
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:05,119
distributions as well. So, um, also, uh,

673
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,640
what's, I guess, really important is

674
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,560
that

675
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,280
if

676
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,200
a variable we're working with

677
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,359
corresponds to the sum

678
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,200
of

679
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:24,160
independent or uncorrelated uh terms,

680
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,880
the sum can approach a normal

681
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,320
distribution well.

682
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,000
And um if one

683
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,119
uh

684
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,800
looks at I guess linear sort of

685
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,599
projections

686
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,520
of uh

687
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,680
multi-dimensional

688
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,839
vectors x's

689
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:51,920
um if you had sort of a random direction

690
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:54,240
in the mdimensional space

691
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,680
the projection onto that random

692
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,800
direction will correspond respond to

693
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,800
sums of

694
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,000
close to sort of identically distributed

695
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,680
random variables but we'll very likely

696
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:15,280
have a uh a Gaussian distribution as

697
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:17,760
well. Um the uh I this will come up when

698
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,640
we talk about regression modeling. Um

699
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,520
but um when we look at sort of the error

700
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:28,800
vector from a regression

701
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:33,760
the um feasibility of the error vector

702
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,320
being close to Gaussian is uh plausible

703
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,880
and reasonable given the way it's

704
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:44,400
constructed sometimes.

705
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:47,839
Okay. Well, let's uh move on then to

706
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,280
this note on probability theory for

707
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:55,280
asset pricing. What's really neat about

708
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,599
this uh note is that we're going to

709
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,560
introduce you just with basic

710
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,720
probability theory to one of the more

711
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,560
important models in uh

712
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,400
quantitative finance or at least in

713
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,440
early quantitative finance which is the

714
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:16,079
capital asset pricing model. And so um

715
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,079
let's consider

716
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,400
a simple

717
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,400
uh

718
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,560
context where we have one risky asset

719
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,280
like a stock and we have a one period

720
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,480
model where

721
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,359
we have uh

722
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,599
the beginning of the period

723
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:44,160
is

724
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:49,480
t not and the end of the period is t1 I

725
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,480
guess. Um and so

726
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,280
and

727
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:02,839
there's this risky asset A. So there's a

728
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,839
risky asset

729
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,240
A.

730
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,079
Um, and

731
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:17,920
we'll consider

732
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:20,920
a market agent having QA shares

733
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,920
of

734
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,480
the asset

735
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:31,720
and

736
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,720
just Q units of a risk-free asset.

737
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,160
Now, the risk-free asset

738
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,560
is like putting money in the bank and

739
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:48,960
being confident that you'll get it back

740
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:53,599
with interest. Um, and uh we'll assume

741
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,000
that the risk-free asset costs uh a

742
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,200
dollar.

743
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,200
So, a dollar per unit.

744
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:09,960
and the uh risky asset will be of price

745
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,960
pa per share.

746
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:23,119
So this market agent has a wealth at

747
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:26,000
time zero. So W0 is going to be equal to

748
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,079
Q A PA

749
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,640
plus Q

750
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,920
times$1.

751
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,520
Um and okay so maybe we'll put an F here

752
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:42,720
just to indicate that it's sort of the

753
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:45,280
risk-free asset. Um now at time t1

754
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:51,920
um

755
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:57,280
so this is the uh the t not prices

756
00:43:51,920 --> 00:44:02,760
are given here at t1 the risk-free asset

757
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,760
is going to be worth 1 + r

758
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,319
f

759
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,599
and the price of the risky asset.

760
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,119
We'll assume that it's a random variable

761
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:22,560
given by f tilda.

762
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,280
And um

763
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,319
for simplicity,

764
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,040
we'll assume that it has some mean mu

765
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,520
and variance sigma squared. Well, now

766
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,560
right away this is maybe a bad

767
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,520
assumption to make because Gaussian or

768
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,200
normal distributions can be arbitrarily

769
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:47,200
large negative but we'll assume that the

770
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,200
likelihood of impossible values is very

771
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,000
close to zero. So that this is a useful

772
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,079
model. Um all right. So this is the time

773
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
t1

774
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:02,640
uh

775
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:06,880
state of the uh market which has sort of

776
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,960
certainty for the uh

777
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,640
risk-free

778
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,680
investment but uncertain outcome for the

779
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,680
risky asset.

780
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,800
Well, um,

781
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:27,200
one could consider

782
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,280
the agent being able to

783
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,760
buy

784
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,560
X units of the risky asset at the

785
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,319
initial time point

786
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,480
T0

787
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:44,960
and then have end of period wealth that

788
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:51,400
reflects that trade of buying X units at

789
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,400
t not. So at the end of

790
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:59,839
the period T1

791
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,160
time there will be QA plus X shares with

792
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,640
value F tilda

793
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:09,920
and

794
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:14,960
the X shares will have been bought by

795
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:17,280
paying PA the T0 price at time zero.

796
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,720
And so there will be money invested in

797
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,359
the risk-free asset earning uh the

798
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:27,599
interest rate or at the absolute return

799
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:30,480
of 1 plus RF. Now

800
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,680
what we want to do is consider what is

801
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,160
the optimal choice of X

802
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,480
the number of shares to buy for this

803
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:45,520
agent. And in order to

804
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:49,680
make that choice, one can apply

805
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,839
um sort of the uh decision theory under

806
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,839
uncertainty

807
00:46:51,839 --> 00:47:00,400
um and associate a utility of the end

808
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:02,720
period wealth given by some utility

809
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,760
function U.

810
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:10,640
And we can choose the x value to

811
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:14,319
maximize the expected utility of wealth.

812
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:21,520
So importantly

813
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:26,480
um if we have u of w as a function of w

814
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:31,760
and there's basically a um

815
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:34,720
w0 value here um

816
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,599
utility of w0

817
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:42,319
there are some standard assumptions one

818
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:47,119
makes as to what the utility function is

819
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:49,520
like. Um, and we might assume that the

820
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,520
first derivative and second derivative

821
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,520
exist.

822
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,920
So we'll assume

823
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:03,079
that these exist.

824
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,079
And so well the first derivative

825
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,000
is likely to be positive.

826
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,680
More wealth is preferred to less.

827
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,880
So we sort of have a a better direction

828
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,960
being up and to the right. And the

829
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,680
second derivative,

830
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:27,839
this actually could be less than zero

831
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:31,599
if there's a decreasing marginal utility

832
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:33,520
to more wealth. So this function might

833
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,880
go

834
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,040
and look like this with a u prime

835
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,520
greater than zero and u doublep prime

836
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:45,440
less than zero. Um

837
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,920
so these kinds of assumptions are

838
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:52,720
reasonable to assume and

839
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,880
the theory of sort of decision rational

840
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,960
decision making under uncertainty. If

841
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:03,839
this is indeed your utility function is

842
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:08,480
to find the action X that maximizes

843
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:13,280
this. And if we are lucky, we might be

844
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:16,880
able to solve for X by satisfying the

845
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:21,520
first order condition, the derivative of

846
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,480
the expected utility equaling zero at

847
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,960
the maximum value.

848
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:30,079
And uh yeah,

849
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,000
>> why would you use anything other than

850
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,440
the identity function for you? Because

851
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,200
surely you just want to maximize your

852
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,000
end period as well.

853
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,520
Um

854
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,280
the uh let's see if you use the identity

855
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,720
um

856
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:49,040
uh then

857
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,559
there's sort of well it it will turn out

858
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,559
there's no penalty for risk that you're

859
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:58,880
undertaking.

860
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:02,240
And so with this decreasing marginal

861
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,680
utility of wealth, you end up having a

862
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:09,520
penalty for taking risks.

863
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:13,160
And so um

864
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,160
the uh

865
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,240
yeah um

866
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:26,880
okay so I'll I'll leave it there, but

867
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:31,440
it's a very good question. Um and uh

868
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,760
let's see there there's actually some

869
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:37,599
well there's some really interesting

870
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:40,880
discussions and uh about how to

871
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:44,800
optimally uh sort of invest

872
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,559
um as as this case and uh there was a

873
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:52,319
controversy between Claude Shannon and

874
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,760
uh um I think it was I think it was

875
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,920
Milton Freriedman.

876
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,480
um about uh sort of maximizing

877
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,079
um the

878
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:08,559
exponential or the the the expected log

879
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:12,160
return of investments uh just period and

880
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:15,200
that being optimal. So anyway, we'll

881
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,800
return to that discussion later as well,

882
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,319
but for now, let's just assume that this

883
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,720
is a reasonable thing to do. And um in

884
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,319
order to

885
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,119
solve this problem, we're actually going

886
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:30,880
to use a lema called Stein's lema, which

887
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,240
is

888
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,760
a curious mathematical result dealing

889
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,200
with

890
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:43,920
normally distributed y variable

891
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:48,000
and uh yar, they're jointly distributed

892
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,480
with each other and Gaussian. If we look

893
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,079
at the expected

894
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:58,559
value of g of y times y minus mu

895
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,880
and u

896
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,440
the expected value of g prime of y if

897
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,720
both of those exist then we get these

898
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,960
simple formulas for essentially the

899
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:14,800
covariance between g of y and y and the

900
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:18,960
covariance of g and y and y star. So the

901
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,960
this is a mathematical theorem that is

902
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,079
sort of abstract

903
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:28,800
as it's stated but it ends up being

904
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,960
applicable in our problem. Um so if we

905
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:35,040
define our wealth at the end of the

906
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:39,839
period at time t1 to be given by this w

907
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:46,000
tilda vector. Um then

908
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:47,599
if the outcome of the asset price

909
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,800
filda

910
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:54,720
if this is Gaussian

911
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,839
then uh this

912
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,480
wealth at time t1 will also be Gaussian

913
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:03,440
because we're just taking a multiple of

914
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:10,960
that plus a constant.

915
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:15,760
So that note is simple. Um then if we

916
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,240
look at the expected utility and try to

917
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,040
take the derivative of that with respect

918
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:24,160
to x.

919
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:27,280
Then under certain conditions we can

920
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,400
take the expectation

921
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:35,520
of the derivative with respect to x of

922
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:39,760
the u integrant with the expectation.

923
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,480
Now under what conditions is it feasible

924
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,160
to differentiate sort of underneath the

925
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:50,839
integral sign when you're doing

926
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,839
computations in calculus

927
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,640
I mean

928
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:09,520
I mean basically what we want to do is

929
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,440
take the expected value of U of

930
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,880
um

931
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,880
W tilda plus delta

932
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:24,079
and subtract the expectation of U of W

933
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:28,240
tilda

934
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:30,400
and divide by delta and take the limit

935
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,880
as this

936
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,720
goes to zero.

937
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,359
So that's sort of the formula for

938
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,359
computing the derivative.

939
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:46,800
It turns out we can do that if the first

940
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,440
derivative of u

941
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:55,839
is bounded or has bounded expectation.

942
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,520
And so if that's possible to do then we

943
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:00,800
can take the derivative underneath the

944
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:05,520
integral sign and we have basically the

945
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:09,280
derivative of u multiplied by

946
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:13,680
the chain rule the derivative of w tilda

947
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:16,640
with respect to x. So if we take the

948
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:21,599
derivative of w tilda with respect to x

949
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,520
we get f tilda minus p a * 1 + rf. So

950
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:28,160
this is just the chain rule of

951
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:31,119
differentiation there. Now um with this

952
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:37,280
expression in black

953
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:43,280
um we can use the uh

954
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:46,480
well let's see we we can express this as

955
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,760
the expected product of two random

956
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,960
variables is equal to the co-variance

957
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,720
plus the product of the expectations.

958
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:00,880
So here we have U prime and F tilda

959
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,520
minus PA1 plus RF the co-variance

960
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,000
between those two plus the product of

961
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,200
their expectations is equal to that

962
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,920
expected product

963
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:17,680
then um by Stein's lema

964
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,920
one actually can simplify or reexpress

965
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:23,200
this covariance

966
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,280
as the expected second derivative

967
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,559
of u

968
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:31,599
times the co-variance of w

969
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:35,599
and f.

970
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:38,240
And so we can then substitute this

971
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:42,559
expression

972
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:47,280
into this last expression here and get

973
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:49,359
zero equals that co-variance plus the

974
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,720
product of the

975
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:58,000
first expectations there.

976
00:56:52,720 --> 00:57:01,280
And um so we're substituting in this

977
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,520
expected second derivative of u times

978
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,520
the co-variance in that formula. Now

979
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,280
with this

980
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,520
um

981
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:16,079
expression here

982
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:20,000
um we have this co-variance of w and f.

983
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:26,640
Well, the coariance between W and F is

984
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:29,599
simply the co-variance of U f with a

985
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:35,640
multiple of F. So it equals that

986
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,640
multiple times the variance of F.

987
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,280
And so we plug that in to this coariance

988
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,640
term.

989
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,799
And what's curious

990
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,079
and sort of is the punchline is that

991
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:52,720
this final equation

992
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,599
gives us a formula

993
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:00,160
for

994
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:03,280
um how we uh solve

995
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:07,280
for um

996
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:11,520
how we solve for x.

997
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:13,760
And so the value of x that we should

998
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:19,359
choose

999
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:23,599
um will basically satisfy this equation.

1000
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:28,240
Um and uh

1001
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:33,200
so our x value will depend upon what the

1002
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:36,799
price of the asset is. And um it

1003
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:40,640
actually is equal to

1004
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:43,640
a discounted value of the expected

1005
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,640
price

1006
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:51,280
plus this other term here.

1007
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,920
And this other term here, the second

1008
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,079
derivative is negative.

1009
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,920
First derivative is positive. So this is

1010
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:03,440
actually a negative factor here. And so

1011
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,520
we end up getting that

1012
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:09,119
um

1013
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,599
we have a formula that

1014
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:15,760
sort of depends upon

1015
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:17,440
that ratio of second derivative

1016
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,040
expectation to first derivative

1017
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:25,200
expectation of the uh utility function.

1018
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:28,799
Now in economics classes maybe some of

1019
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:32,160
you have come across the constant

1020
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:34,160
absolute risk aversion utility function.

1021
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,799
Has anybody come across that in an

1022
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:43,040
economics class? Maybe maybe not. Um but

1023
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:45,920
that function which is a constant

1024
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:55,240
minus

1025
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:55,240
a constant minus e to the minus a uh w.

1026
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:03,440
Um this is the constant

1027
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:09,960
absolute risk aversion utility function.

1028
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,960
And so it basically um

1029
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:19,839
you know has has the right shape

1030
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:22,960
um for u in terms of marginal utilities

1031
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:26,240
decreasing and

1032
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,880
utilities always uh increasing. And so

1033
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:34,640
with this particular

1034
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:39,040
utility function we have the up prime /

1035
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:44,720
u prime um those actually uh giving us

1036
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:48,960
just the factor a here. So we have our

1037
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:52,240
price of the asset should equal the

1038
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,040
discounted expected cash flow minus a

1039
01:00:52,240 --> 01:01:00,960
risk adjustment.

1040
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:04,079
Um and so and the risk adjustment in the

1041
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:08,720
price that's like the fair price for the

1042
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:11,440
asset um varies depending upon what the

1043
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:16,079
risk aversion coefficient is of the

1044
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:18,640
agent and uh also the magnitude of the

1045
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:22,640
shares of the risky asset

1046
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:26,960
that are obtained and the variance of

1047
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,880
the uh of the price outcome. So, so the

1048
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:33,520
fair price

1049
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:36,720
for um the market agent basically is

1050
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:43,000
balancing all of these factors.

1051
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:43,000
And uh let's see if um

1052
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:50,559
okay um well with this result for a

1053
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:55,079
single asset what's really neat is that

1054
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,079
we can um

1055
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:04,160
generalize from one asset to many

1056
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,480
and set up the whole problem with almost

1057
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:11,920
the same notation.

1058
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:14,240
So we consider defining a Q vector of

1059
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,200
shares of

1060
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:20,960
assets one through N

1061
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:23,760
A1 through A N and QF units of the

1062
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:29,520
risk-free asset

1063
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:34,200
and we can go through the same logic of

1064
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,200
the initial wealth being

1065
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:42,000
the Q shares per asset times the price

1066
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:45,680
at time z t0 of the assets plus the

1067
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:50,640
value of the risk-free investment.

1068
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:52,880
And we can assume that the random prices

1069
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:57,799
at time t1

1070
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,799
are jointly normally distributed.

1071
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:08,240
Um and so we then can think of the

1072
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,240
market agent uh basically adjusting the

1073
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:14,240
initial

1074
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:17,599
shares Q by the X vector

1075
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:20,000
and choosing the X vector to maximize

1076
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:22,000
expected utility.

1077
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,880
And

1078
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,559
we can uh

1079
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:31,280
just plug everything in now with vectors

1080
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:36,799
instead of scalers

1081
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:39,200
and the same arguments apply.

1082
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:43,280
And we end up getting at the end of the

1083
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:46,880
day different sort of equilibrium prices

1084
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,880
for the different assets that are sort

1085
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:54,160
of discounted

1086
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:58,880
expected values of the price

1087
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:03,440
plus a penalty depending upon the sort

1088
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:08,880
of risk aversion of the agent.

1089
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:15,599
Um and so uh we end up getting

1090
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:18,599
this uh final result here. Now, um

1091
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,599
what's

1092
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:28,079
particularly interesting um from this

1093
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,760
uh setup is to then say well

1094
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:36,000
what

1095
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:39,839
uh prices should be holding if this um

1096
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,680
market model is in equilibrium.

1097
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:43,839
And so

1098
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:46,319
if the market

1099
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:50,480
is in equilibrium,

1100
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:53,280
then we should have expected returns

1101
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,000
of risky assets

1102
01:04:53,280 --> 01:05:00,720
that satisfy

1103
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,240
um this formula here.

1104
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,520
And

1105
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,039
if we look at

1106
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,400
a

1107
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:14,000
an initial endowment sort of of no

1108
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,359
shares at all and

1109
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,200
define the X allocation

1110
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:25,240
to be an equilibrium investment

1111
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,240
in the market portfolio.

1112
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:32,400
Then

1113
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:37,520
our market portfolio defined by X

1114
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:40,720
will have a market value of F tilda M.

1115
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:45,280
The sum of the X size

1116
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:48,240
shares times F tilda I. The price

1117
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:52,640
initially of the market portfolio will

1118
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:56,559
be just the sum of the XI shares times

1119
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:01,039
the initial prices P AI.

1120
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:04,880
And the return of the market portfolio

1121
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:07,920
um will just be the change in value

1122
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:12,880
divided by the initial value

1123
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:15,920
which corresponds to a weighted sum of

1124
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,200
the asset changes

1125
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:22,960
or percentage returns. So the percentage

1126
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:26,720
return R tilda M is simply the weighted

1127
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:32,000
returns of the individual assets

1128
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:35,440
and this is our expected return of the

1129
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,039
market portfolio when the underlying

1130
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,039
assets satisfy these uh pricing

1131
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:44,400
conditions.

1132
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:50,000
Now um

1133
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:51,599
if we expand this expected market return

1134
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,200
uh

1135
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:57,119
expression,

1136
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,640
we can successively derive

1137
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,280
that

1138
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,559
it equals

1139
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:07,280
the risk-free rate

1140
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,119
plus this blue factor times the

1141
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,960
co-variance

1142
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:17,920
of the initial

1143
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:23,079
uh sort of W vector with RM.

1144
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,079
And uh this

1145
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:33,359
blue expression

1146
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:35,839
can be solved for as the sort of excess

1147
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:37,760
return of the market portfolio divided

1148
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:40,160
by the co-variance

1149
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:44,400
term here.

1150
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:47,039
And so we end up getting that

1151
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,520
this

1152
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:55,599
co-variance of

1153
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:58,640
W and RM end up being simply uh PM times

1154
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,160
the co-variance of RM or the variance of

1155
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,720
RM.

1156
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:06,319
And plugging this in,

1157
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:10,319
we finally get that the expected returns

1158
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:14,799
of different assets

1159
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:17,120
are simply a beta factor times the

1160
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:20,239
excess return

1161
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:24,960
expected return of the market portfolio

1162
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:27,679
over the risk-free rate. And so this

1163
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,679
expression is actually

1164
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,719
the expression for what's called the

1165
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:37,839
security market line

1166
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:41,199
where we have the expected return of

1167
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:44,960
asset I is the risk-free rate plus a

1168
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:48,080
beta factor times the excess return of

1169
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:51,440
the market over the risk-free rate. And

1170
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:56,440
this beta factor

1171
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,440
is the ratio of the co-variance

1172
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:02,319
of

1173
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:06,920
asset I and the market portfolio divided

1174
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,920
by the variance of the market portfolio.

1175
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:13,440
And so

1176
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:15,759
this beta I is equivalent to the

1177
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,880
regression coefficient of the excess

1178
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:22,679
return of stocks regressed on the excess

1179
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,679
return of the market.

1180
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:32,080
So in this model um we end up having

1181
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,199
that different assets will have

1182
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:38,159
different returns

1183
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:43,600
and those returns

1184
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:46,880
are sort of bounded below sort of by RF

1185
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:51,600
but then are

1186
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:53,839
increased by having a higher beta factor

1187
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,280
multip multiplying the excess return of

1188
01:09:53,839 --> 01:10:03,120
the market. So you may be familiar with

1189
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:06,560
um issues of betas in equity markets and

1190
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:12,640
there being low betas or high beta uh

1191
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:15,440
stocks. Um in this model we have that

1192
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:19,440
the way you get higher expected return

1193
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:25,040
is to have a higher beta.

1194
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:29,679
And uh so um so this

1195
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:33,120
um also just uh leads to

1196
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:35,600
understanding sort of what the

1197
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:38,880
equilibrium prices are of individual

1198
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:42,560
assets. If we take those expressions for

1199
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:45,920
returns and then uh reverse them into

1200
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:49,600
expressions for the equilibrium prices,

1201
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:52,239
we have that the equilibrium prices are

1202
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,239
sort of the expected

1203
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:55,239
terminal

1204
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:04,560
price divided by a discount factor that

1205
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:06,400
discounts by the discount rate of the

1206
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,960
risk-free investment.

1207
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:15,880
but adding to that um a uh penalty based

1208
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,880
on the level of risk that's being taken.

1209
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:24,159
And here are just some uh references on

1210
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:29,360
this topic that

1211
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:32,880
you may want to uh check out. Um the uh

1212
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:36,159
the development here was actually uh

1213
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:39,679
taken from the first reference by Frank

1214
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:43,840
De Jang and Barbara Rindy. Um there are

1215
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:47,280
other important citations. One of them

1216
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:51,840
that's of interest is uh John Lintner

1217
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:54,239
the valuation of risky assets. Um

1218
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:58,640
the capital asset pricing model was

1219
01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:02,480
actually um uh formulated by John

1220
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:06,800
Lintner and William Sharp uh back in the

1221
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:10,400
early 60s and I distributed one of the

1222
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:14,400
articles of Lintner um in the Canvas

1223
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:18,800
site and it's actually nice to be able

1224
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:22,800
to read a very technical paper

1225
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:25,199
um in an accessible way. And so I think

1226
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,800
that you'll enjoy checking that paper

1227
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:35,280
out. Um

1228
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:37,840
okay. Um well, let me turn then to

1229
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:40,159
the sort of main topic in our syllabus

1230
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:44,400
for today, but uh it's sort of the tail

1231
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:48,800
end of today. um to talk about uh

1232
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:51,679
stochastic processes uh concepts and one

1233
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:56,400
of the most important concepts in

1234
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:59,679
stochcastic processes is the u concept

1235
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:02,719
of a martingale process.

1236
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:06,320
And so if we

1237
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:09,360
have a stochcastic process

1238
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:12,719
given by a sequence of

1239
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:15,760
random variables xn,

1240
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:19,840
we can define

1241
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:24,800
a related process mn

1242
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:28,880
which is defined as functions

1243
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:31,600
of the first n x's for each n.

1244
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:36,159
So if we

1245
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:39,360
have uh mn depending only on the first n

1246
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:43,520
x's in some well- definfined way given

1247
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:47,199
by a function fn then we will say that

1248
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,880
this mn sequence

1249
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:51,440
which is random because of its

1250
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,040
dependence on the x's it will be a

1251
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,960
martingale

1252
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:59,360
if the expected value

1253
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,880
of the nth

1254
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:05,280
m

1255
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:08,640
given the first n minus one x's is

1256
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,280
simply equal to the n minus1 first value

1257
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,080
of m

1258
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:17,760
and we also are going to require that

1259
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:20,560
the magnitude of the mns as has a finite

1260
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:23,040
expectation for all n2

1261
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,199
now um

1262
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,440
let's consider perhaps the simplest

1263
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:30,960
example of a martingale which is

1264
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:34,080
basically ally a random walk.

1265
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:38,239
Suppose the XN sequence is just

1266
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:40,880
independent random variables that each

1267
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:47,679
has mean zero

1268
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:49,199
and Sn is the sum of the first n X's.

1269
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:52,480
Then

1270
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:55,360
this SN is a random walk with steps

1271
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:59,040
given by X. and it's going to be a

1272
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:01,920
martingale with respect to the original

1273
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,239
process of XNs.

1274
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:07,520
Now, we can make this example even

1275
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:11,440
simpler by assuming that the X's are

1276
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:14,800
independent and identically distributed

1277
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:17,600
and maybe that they're discreet with

1278
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:21,600
just a plus one or minus one step

1279
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:25,760
increment with equal probability.

1280
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:28,159
So these X's have expectation equal to

1281
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,600
zero

1282
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:36,080
and variance equal to one

1283
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:38,560
and the process SN has expectation zero

1284
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:41,840
the sum of the expectations and the

1285
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:44,080
variance of SN it's the variance of a

1286
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,520
sum of independent

1287
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:50,960
steps increments and so it's just the

1288
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:56,159
sum of the variances so that's in.

1289
01:15:50,960 --> 01:16:00,719
Well, here's a random walk realization

1290
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:02,239
of this model with a 100 steps.

1291
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,360
And

1292
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:08,480
so it basically starts at zero at time

1293
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:13,760
zero and then as steps occur increments

1294
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:17,120
up or down uh plus or minus one. If we

1295
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:21,679
increase from a 100 steps to a thousand,

1296
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:25,199
this is what a realization uh looks

1297
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:29,520
like. And then here's an extension from

1298
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:33,520
1,000 steps to 10,000 steps. And what's

1299
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:36,159
rather significant is the general shape

1300
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,560
of this random walk process. As we

1301
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:43,280
increase the number of steps, it becomes

1302
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:47,120
this very sort of jagged uh path

1303
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:49,600
and it actually corresponds to

1304
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:53,280
brownie and motion models that we'll

1305
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:58,159
come across. Now, if we were to realize

1306
01:16:53,280 --> 01:17:00,480
10 different paths of length 10,000,

1307
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:03,840
here are

1308
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:06,640
examples of that. And so one can see

1309
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,640
that for

1310
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,520
low number of steps there's not very

1311
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:15,679
much variability. It increases as we

1312
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:19,520
increase the number of steps. And here

1313
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:21,360
we're just drawing bands at plus or

1314
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:26,400
minus multiples of the standard

1315
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:30,320
deviation of the random walk value. And

1316
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,400
so um these

1317
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:36,400
standard deviation

1318
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,400
levels uh basically apply just through

1319
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,000
you know the mathematics of uh

1320
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,640
calculating

1321
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,480
uh one or two standard deviations of the

1322
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,719
sum.

1323
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:53,600
And what you know we know from

1324
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:56,159
uh our central limit theorem is that the

1325
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:59,600
sort of distribution of possible values

1326
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:02,640
at any given time step will be closely

1327
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:06,000
modeled by a Gaussian distribution

1328
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:08,320
because of the central limit theorem.

1329
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,560
There we have a stop. Okay, I'm going to

1330
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:12,560
take two more minutes just to show you a

1331
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,560
more not a more interesting but a

1332
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,239
related but very interesting uh

1333
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,679
martingale.

1334
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:23,199
Suppose that

1335
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:27,040
once we've calculated the random walk

1336
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:30,960
SN, we look at the square of Sn and

1337
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:34,080
subtract N sigma squared.

1338
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:36,400
It turns out that this is a martingale

1339
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:39,360
as well.

1340
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:42,640
And here's one realization

1341
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:45,840
over 10,000 steps.

1342
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:48,880
And here are 10 realizations.

1343
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:52,239
Um, and so these look very very

1344
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:55,520
different from the simple random walk.

1345
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:59,120
But these as well are martingales.

1346
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:02,719
And so one of the uh what we'll see next

1347
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:07,600
time is how martinales

1348
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:11,199
have very special uh properties which

1349
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:14,320
can be used to solve challenging

1350
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:18,560
uh probability problems. And just as a

1351
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:24,040
closing remark um does anyone here know

1352
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:24,040
uh where the term martingale comes from?

1353
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:30,080
Do we have any uh equestrians?

1354
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:33,920
There's a bridal in a horse called a

1355
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:36,960
martingale bridal that keeps the horse

1356
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:40,480
straight looking straight. So it sort of

1357
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:42,640
is a a bridal that sort of has

1358
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,159
pressure on both sides of the mouth to

1359
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,560
keep the horse looking straight. And

1360
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:48,880
what's true about a martingale is that

1361
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,760
the expected value in the future is

1362
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:56,880
always a constant level equal to the

1363
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:59,520
last level of the series. So that that

1364
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,840
property will end up being very very

1365
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:06,120
convenient and we'll see examples of

1366
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,120
that uh next time.
