1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,440
and uh Juliet, we can't wait to hear

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,440
about the model,

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,800
maybe.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,320
>> Oh, okay. That goes a little little too

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,320
fast. Um, well, hello everyone. My name

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,800
is Juliet Simpson. I am a researcher at

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,080
ENL. I'm excited to be talking to you

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,359
about the modeling work that we've been

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,559
doing. I know I've gotten a lot of great

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,200
feedins from earlier today. Um I will

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,120
just start by noting that uh this is

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,719
geared a little bit more towards like

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,160
teaching people about generally the

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,760
modeling that happens for these systems

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,960
and a little bit less towards results.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,680
So if you're interested in that, feel

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,360
free to talk to me. And also um I'm

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,920
going to be talking about modeling for

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,360
these systems within the context of a

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
model that we've been building out on

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,440
the legup project. Um, but just know

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,359
that there are a lot of other models out

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,600
there. Um, each tailored to kind of do

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,440
some slightly different things. Um, and

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,520
a lot of great options. And I'm just

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,600
doing this kind of within one context.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,159
So to get started, I'm talking

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,840
specifically today about technoeconomic

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,119
modeling. And that involves two

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
components if you're not familiar with

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,119
it. Um, as you might guess by the name,

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
the technical model and the economic

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,479
model. And this is really important

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,119
because it allows us to think about

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,439
trade-offs between impacts to technical

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,360
design, how that impacts operation and

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,119
performance of a system and then looking

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,119
at the costs of that, the economic

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,119
impact.

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,880
Now, why does all of this modeling uh

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
why is it matter? Why is it important?

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
This really helps us to answer a lot of

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
questions without having to go dig holes

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,119
in the ground. um we can start to think

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,759
a little more critically ahead of time

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759
before the design and before the build.

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,079
We can think about what communities does

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,360
the geothermal network make sense in. Uh

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,880
does it make sense to just go for

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,479
geothermal bore holes or should we pull

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,119
in some of the other thermal resources

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,799
that have been mentioned today? What

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,799
kind of monthly payment might be

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,479
required from customers or what expected

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
total costs might there be? There's lots

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,160
of questions on that side of the

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,400
economics as well. Um, so having

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,040
something that can help um, people start

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,280
to think about the finance side as well.

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
And then after you build, what would

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
happen if you added one more house to

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,879
the loop or what would happen if you

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
wanted to change a little bit the

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,400
performance set point for the

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
temperatures or the operation or the

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
speeds of the loop. Um, so being able to

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,160
work with some sort of um, modeling

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,720
option, digital twin, something that

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,400
lets you change those parameters before

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,879
going out and impacting your customers

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,879
in the real world.

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
Couple of components that I'm then going

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,760
to talk through in a minute. um both on

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,040
the physical system side, a lot of the

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,879
major components that we've already

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,200
mentioned today, understanding your

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,319
building loads, knowing um when they're

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,480
going to need heating and cooling

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,920
throughout the year and how much of it.

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,200
Understanding your opportunities for

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,959
thermal resources in an area. Um

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,959
capturing the distribution system

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,400
correctly. That could include knowing

84
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,640
whether you want to go for a one pipe

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
system or two pipes. How big is the pipe

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
going to be? How much thermal inertia is

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,280
there in the water or whatever working

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,720
fluid you have moving in that pipe? How

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
well are your heat pumps going to

90
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,159
perform? What's their coefficient of

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
performance look like with different

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,000
entering temperatures?

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,080
And then something we've discussed a

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,480
little less today, the economic side.

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
Um, estimating capital cost, operating

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,680
cost, maintenance is all really

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,200
difficult. It's something that we we

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,040
certainly struggle with, but it's really

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
important to these systems. And then

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,519
also thinking about the finance plan.

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
what's your cost recovery look like? Um,

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,120
who is paying for it? It's probably

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,879
going to have a big impact on that. Um,

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
but that then has an impact at the end

105
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,040
of the day on what customer payments

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,040
look like as well.

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,599
Now, we've tried to put both halves of

108
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,840
those models into something we're

109
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,000
working on at ENL called heat nets. This

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,879
stands for heat and economic analysis

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
tool for network thermal systems. ENL

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,000
has been building out this tool in

113
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,239
collaboration with heat as part of the

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,239
legup project. And so we're really

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
excited to have both halves of it up and

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,040
running now. So we have this code that

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,959
is written in Python. It's intended to

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
long-term be open source and we're

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,519
working towards having that being a

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,680
public GitHub repository. The first half

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
is the physics-based model. That's a

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,759
reduced order model. As Isbel mentioned

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
earlier, the idea there is that it's a

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
little bit more uh high level. It really

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,000
builds on a lot of other more detailed

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080
models to capture the energy flow around

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
the network and the use of electricity

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,520
over time.

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,000
The second model is the economic model

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,639
used to calculate uh economic metrics of

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,639
the system as well.

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,600
So I'm going to give a little bit of

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
highle information about both of those

134
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,919
models before talking about what kind of

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,080
questions we can answer with them. So

136
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,479
first on the reduced order side, this is

137
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,240
for capturing the physics of what's

138
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,320
actually happening on the loop. Where is

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,479
heat moving over time? Where is water

140
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,040
moving? Uh how much electricity is being

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,560
used for that whole process. The major

142
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,800
components that we're capturing are

143
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,960
shown here in this simple diagram, but

144
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,199
know that this is showing one building

145
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,160
when you might have 50. And these are

146
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,840
just going to be um repeated over time.

147
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
The main backbone of this model is the

148
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,680
ambient temperature loop. So, a lot of

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,160
the modeling effort here goes into the

150
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,800
effort of capturing how does heat move

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,800
physically around this loop. How much

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
thermal inertia is in there? So if you

153
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,080
dump in some heat, how quickly is it

154
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,919
going to change temperature and how

155
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,680
quickly is that going to then propagate

156
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,440
around the loop and affect all of the

157
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,120
customers?

158
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,520
Then plugging in and exchanging heat

159
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,759
with that we have all of the buildings.

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Um so that requires doing some building

161
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,520
modeling, understanding their loads over

162
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,199
time, understanding how the heat pumps

163
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
are going to perform given different

164
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,039
entering temperatures um from that main

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,039
thermal loop. There's also all of your

166
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,720
thermal sources and syncs. So in this

167
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,639
case we're mostly focused on borehole

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,680
fields. Um but there could be other ones

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,600
as well. Um this modeling is being done

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
um like I mentioned at a reduced order

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
level. So we're relying on collaborators

172
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
who are doing some more detailed

173
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,400
modeling including models that we're

174
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,800
getting from Lawrence Berkeley National

175
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
Labs um to be able to look at what is

176
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,199
our bore hole bore hole performance look

177
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,960
like over time.

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,840
And then finally, having some sort of

179
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,440
central control control station. Um,

180
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
being able to model the circulation

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
pumps to move the fluid around. Um, in

182
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,520
our models right now, we always account

183
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,600
for the option of an auxiliary heating

184
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,600
and cooling system. And that allows us

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
to really play with our temperature

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
bounds and um, how many buildings we

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
have on the loop. And then having a

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,120
control decision architecture that

189
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,440
determines how do all of these pieces

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,440
run together.

191
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
Just as a quick example of some of the

192
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,199
outputs we can get from that. On the

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,600
left we're showing one that shows uh

194
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,280
spatial trends. So as you move around

195
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,440
the loop, this is done in a straight

196
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,160
line. We can imagine the end feeds back

197
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,000
into the beginning. Um this relates back

198
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
to what Isbel was saying earlier that

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
you see changes in temperature as you

200
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,240
move around the loop. And then you also

201
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,319
see things happen over time. So the one

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
on the right hand side is showing uh

203
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
every hour throughout a year how is heat

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,319
being exchanged with the loop. So in

205
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,280
this case we're showing building loads

206
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,280
and bore hole loads um in blue and green

207
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,360
and those are generally opposites. So in

208
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,360
the wintertime buildings take heat out

209
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,440
of the loop and the borehole field puts

210
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,039
heat in. We see the opposite trend in

211
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
the summertime

212
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,759
and then some additional auxiliary heat

213
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,759
in this model. Um, and so you could see

214
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,240
maybe where there's areas uh that you

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,240
need um you might need some additional

216
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
heat and you can consider trade-offs for

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
is it worthwhile to have some sort of

218
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,319
electric boiler provide that or to drill

219
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,080
more bore holes. And again, this comes

220
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,520
down to a lot of trade-offs.

221
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,039
The other half of this model is

222
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,280
economic.

223
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,199
Um I will warn you that this is the side

224
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,080
that I spend a little bit less time on

225
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,879
um at work but um this takes in a lot of

226
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,479
inputs from um the physicsbased model.

227
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,840
So the physics based model will tell you

228
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,080
how much electricity are all the

229
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,840
components using over time also what

230
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,759
were the design specs you chose for the

231
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,960
system and then you have to give it some

232
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,199
additional information. So what

233
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,080
financial assumptions are you putting in

234
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,919
um how much of this project uh how much

235
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,479
is financed with debt? How much is

236
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,240
upfront? um what kind of assumptions are

237
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,960
you making on incentives you might

238
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,680
received? That all comes together into a

239
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,440
variety of outputs that we can look at.

240
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,800
One that we're particularly excited

241
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,719
about right now is something we're

242
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,039
calling um LCO X. Um this builds off of

243
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,120
the standard levelized cost of energy

244
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,600
equation, but here we're allowing for

245
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,959
pulling in multiple energy flows. Um so

246
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,519
it's no longer just energy. um our costs

247
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,440
are including both capital cost and the

248
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,240
cost of the electricity to operate the

249
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,320
system and then our thing that we're

250
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,480
producing in this case is heating and

251
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,160
cooling to buildings. Um right now we're

252
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,360
looking at that as just the absolute

253
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,279
values of them. How much total um you

254
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,519
know uh help are you putting into these

255
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,240
buildings to maintain their climate. Um

256
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,560
so heat and cool are equally valued at

257
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,399
the moment.

258
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,240
And we can then get more granular with

259
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,760
those outputs as well. So just an

260
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,279
example of something that you could look

261
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,839
at. Um this is just using

262
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,240
not random numbers but uh example

263
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,320
numbers for some example building. You

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,920
could start to look at how much energy

265
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
consumption do you expect throughout a

266
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,440
year? How does that then trickle down

267
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,600
into what might that user depending on

268
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
um what cost recovery is being used?

269
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,519
What might their monthly bill payment

270
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,440
look like? Things like that. So now we

271
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,120
can start to go all the way from design

272
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,680
decisions down to monthly bills for um

273
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,680
individual homes.

274
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,800
So just kind of to wrap up that this

275
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
idea um showing how the data flows all

276
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,880
together. We have first this reduced

277
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
order model. This is physics-based. We

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
have a lot of different inputs that come

279
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,800
into this. It really relies on highle

280
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,560
modeling done elsewhere that all can

281
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,640
come together.

282
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,680
And a major output from that is the time

283
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,800
series electricity consumption.

284
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
There's some other inputs that we're

285
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,360
going to need to get to the economic

286
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,079
model. So we start to have to think

287
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,680
about component cost, estimating those,

288
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,760
knowing what our financial assumptions

289
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,920
are, and then eventually feeding that

290
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,720
all into an economic model where we can

291
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,959
get outputs like that LCOX value I was

292
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,120
mentioning, also net pleasant value,

293
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,320
internal rate of return, um, and

294
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,320
something we're calling thermal energy

295
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,320
price.

296
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,800
And then you get to answer the fun

297
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
questions. So this is what we're really

298
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
here for. We build out all of this

299
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,839
modeling so that we can start to answer

300
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
interesting questions. So I have two

301
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,120
quick examples here to wrap up. The

302
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,360
first is what if you change the minimum

303
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
loop temperature. Um so in this case

304
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
we're assuming with the way our control

305
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,800
system that we've built is set up um you

306
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,880
have to decide uh when do the pumps ramp

307
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,560
up, when does the borehole get used,

308
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
when does auxiliary heat turn on in

309
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
order to maintain some minimum

310
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
temperature.

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,760
In this case study that we did, we found

312
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,519
that as you increase that minimum loop

313
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,360
temperature, the cost to the utility

314
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,720
goes up greatly. This makes sense.

315
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,880
They're having to work really hard to

316
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,279
maintain a higher temperature, but the

317
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
cost of the consumer goes down slightly

318
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,279
because their heat pump is working more

319
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,279
efficiently now. So, you see this

320
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,959
trade-off here. Well, in this case,

321
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,279
we're talking about annual electricity

322
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,920
costs, not considering capital cost that

323
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,920
goes into that. But um we have to think

324
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,519
about how benefits are shared to all

325
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
parties involved in a geothermal

326
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
network.

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
And as one final example, you can also

328
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
think about what happens as you change

329
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,440
the number and location of bore holes

330
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,200
around the loop. And here we see that if

331
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,320
you just think about electricity system

332
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,120
costs, electricity usage, um more bore

333
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,360
holes means less energy is used. um in

334
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,480
this case because we're not needing any

335
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,000
sort of auxiliary electric boiler. Uh

336
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
but you have to consider that weight

337
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,480
against economic impacts. So how much

338
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,320
did they cost? Was that cost worth it?

339
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,320
What's your trade-off look like there?

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
So thank you all for listening to me

341
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
talk about modeling. I think that

342
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,079
modeling can really help us to answer a

343
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,399
lot of key questions as we move forwards

344
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,480
with building out geothermal networks.

345
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
Um, one model that we're excited about

346
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
for it is heat nets, which I've talked

347
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,240
through some examples of today. Um, but

348
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,240
again, a lot of great modeling going on

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,279
in the space that we're excited for. Um,

350
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,680
but we're looking forward to the

351
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,120
opportunity to think about the um,

352
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,040
analysis of how these design and

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,800
operational decisions impact both

354
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
performance and economics of these

355
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,560
systems.

356
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,560
Thank you.
