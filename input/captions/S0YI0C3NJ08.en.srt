00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,640
from the MIT energy initiative this is

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,000
what if it works a podcast looking at

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,090
the solutions for climate change I'm

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,119
Stoner and today an exploration of how

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,359
the new Administration might change the

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,960
calculus around energy policy what

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,320
should we expect and how impactful might

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,119
the changes be we are joined by Chris

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,439
kid he leads the policy mission of mit's

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,360
recently launched climate project he's

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,120
also the associate dean of climate and

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,480
sustainability at the MIT Sloan School

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,440
of Management and as if that weren't

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,680
enough he is the former deputy director

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,000
of the MIT energy initiative Chris

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,640
thanks for being here thanks for having

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,399
me so based on what we know of

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,760
president-elect Trump's positions and

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,760
obviously it's not just that but

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,280
Republicans have a pretty broad power

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,120
coming up in the next Congress at a high

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,560
level what do you think the implications

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,840
are for climate policy yeah so I would

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,240
say that at least the biggest of the

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,400
Biden administration's climate policies

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,880
the inflation reduction act many

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,400
components of that act are at risk for

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,439
being repealed that act focused on

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,960
subsidizing clean Technologies and I

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,840
think the new Administration will be

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,720
looking at each of those subsidies and

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,439
trying to figure out whether or not they

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,880
want those to continue do you think if

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,799
you had to sort of look at that 30,000

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,759
foot View and you think about the energy

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,360
transition do you think this is going to

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,079
slow it down is it going to actually put

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,560
it in reverse and kind of go backwards

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,399
what would you say if you had to guess

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,479
it'll certainly slow it down um the

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,600
inflation reduction Act and the

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,680
bipartisan infrastructure bill you know

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,840
were key pieces of legis and when they

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,479
were passed lots of academics and

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,360
Industry followers uh measured the

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,840
impact of those acts as as being

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,720
substantial so if those are at risk then

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,080
clearly it's going to slow the

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,400
transition down but a lot of the a lot

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,840
of the heat was directed at Red States I

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
mean this was not only about a clean

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,800
energy transition it was about a just

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,879
transition and and and the Biden

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,040
Administration really popularized this

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,480
idea of of climate Justice and making

59
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,519
sure communities that had been either at

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,840
an advantage in the in the current

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,280
energy economy or or chronically

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,239
disadvantaged did okay in the new world

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,360
isn't that going to save it well

64
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,519
certainly in the data bear out what you

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,319
just said so the clean investment

66
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,800
monitor which sits at at MIT and was

67
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,080
pioneered by Brian De has measured that

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,800
roughly 80% of the inflation reduction

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,440
act subsidies are going to red districts

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,080
or red areas of the country so I do

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,120
think that's going to potentially save

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,879
some of those subsidies but there will

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,799
likely be a targeted approach by the new

74
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,040
Administration that will go through

75
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,560
subsidy by subsidy and probably ask two

76
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,239
questions do I like this technology and

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
do I like where this money is going so

78
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,280
the governor is like where it's going

79
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
well certainly some of them but you know

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,840
if we dive deep into the inflation

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,879
reduction we subsidized rooftop solar we

82
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,200
subsidized offshore wind hydrogen

83
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,560
ccus obviously the offshore wind is

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,720
purely going to Blue States because we

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,200
got the coasts still got the coasts

86
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,480
that's right and if I was a betting

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,720
person I I would not bet the offshore

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,560
wind subsid is going to survive but

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,120
there are other subsidies that are more

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,200
likely to survive whether that's the

91
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
subsidies on hydrogen or the subsidies

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,319
on battery manufacturing those those are

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,640
red State type subsidies yeah a lot of

94
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,239
really important manufacturing related

95
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,280
Industries being supported by those

96
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,200
subsidies that's right we now even have

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,879
a name for it there's there's an area of

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,040
the country called the battery belt

99
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,560
Kentucky Northern Georgia that area the

100
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,440
country is seeing a lot of

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,880
manufacturing enter those regions at

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,280
least we expect partly because of the

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,880
inflation reduction act I expect a lot

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,720
of people are thinking but wait one of

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Trump's confidants at least as far as

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,560
we've seen has been Elon Musk who is

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,280
obviously famous for thinking about some

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,120
of these transitional Technologies you

109
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,520
know many many people own Teslas and you

110
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,759
would think he would want his goal would

111
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:56,120
be to incentivize the purchase of more

112
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,520
Teslas does it matter that somebody who

113
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,400
is not really super pro internal

114
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,479
combustion engines is on

115
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,800
it you know has the president's ear one

116
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,160
would think although this is where

117
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,199
economics teaches us to Think Through

118
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,240
the complete set of incentives so if I

119
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,759
was Elon Musk who has a dominant

120
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,280
position in the electric vehicle

121
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,319
Market I would probably be in favor of

122
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,360
getting rid of the subsidies because I

123
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,600
would be sitting there thinking my cars

124
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,520
will still be sold so I'm I'm going to

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,080
hurt my competitor

126
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,319
more than I'm going to hurt myself and I

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,919
think musk has kind of hinted if not

128
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,080
said that directly in some ways that he

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,000
doesn't really mind if the EV subsidies

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,680
go away and I think that's his rationale

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,680
that it's going to be much more damaging

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,720
to his competitors than it would be to

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,880
Tesla so it's you know we have this

134
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Rising Tides raise all boats but so

135
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,919
lowering Tides lower all boats but if

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,680
they lower my competitor's boats more

137
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:02,120
than mine I might be in favor of it and

138
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,199
he he burned through just by selling so

139
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,680
darn many cars he he burned through his

140
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,599
initial subsidy limit didn't he that's

141
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,840
right there's that and there's also the

142
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:14,199
fact that our research suggests the

143
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,720
biggest limiting factor to EV adoption

144
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,160
now is the lack of infrastructure so the

145
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,199
vehicles are pretty close to cost parity

146
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,919
already it's the fact that an EV buyer

147
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,639
is afraid that they won't be able to

148
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:31,280
charge their EV easily that's keeping

149
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,240
them from from buying that EV and and

150
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Tesla has an advantage on that with

151
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,800
their network but so do you expect then

152
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,960
the network for charging will get built

153
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,120
out it may through the bipartisan

154
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,479
infrastructure bill which did set

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,599
allocate I think roughly 5 to7 billion

156
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,160
do to building more Chargers that was

157
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:58,000
passed uh with bipartisan support so I

158
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,120
don't expect that to be repealed but our

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,440
work also suggests that 5 million doll

160
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,479
is not enough to get to get us to large

161
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,599
scale EV adoption I know you've looked

162
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,280
recently at the notion that the US has

163
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,440
really managed to achieve economic

164
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,840
growth in the last 15 years and has kind

165
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,520
of decoupled that uh from CO2 production

166
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,800
are we able to continue doing that do

167
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
you think that we will I mean that's a

168
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,400
really interesting thing because people

169
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,400
often think well these two things when a

170
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,720
country is growing there's more

171
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,000
pollution going into the air going ahead

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,960
what do you think will happen so if I

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,479
were to look at my crystal ball and the

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,639
Trump Administration has gotten rid of

175
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:46,319
several key subsidies in the inflation

176
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,919
reduction act I would not be surprised

177
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,199
that the economy continued to cut

178
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,639
emissions albe it much slower uh than it

179
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,560
would before and one actually positive

180
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,039
impact from the Trump Administration

181
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,680
terms of cutting emissions is I would

182
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,360
expect him to focus a lot more on

183
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,159
drilling for natural gas so that natural

184
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,639
gas is likely to speed up the retirement

185
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,120
of coal plants uh which has been the

186
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,159
major source of our emission reductions

187
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,319
over the last two decades so that'll

188
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,520
continue I just think we'll get a lot

189
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,960
less Renewables than we otherwise would

190
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,800
have but potentially a lot less coal

191
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,319
than we otherwise would have and just to

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,240
sort of follow up on the clean

193
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,279
technology I know you talked to uh

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,519
representative son Casten from Illinois

195
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,959
recently at MIT and there's this kind of

196
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,200
he talked about this dilemma in

197
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,760
manufacturing which is you know let's

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,760
say you're in the market for solar

199
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,080
panels you can have a factory in the US

200
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
where people obviously make more money

201
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,959
than they probably would in China so you

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,399
like americanmade jobs for Americans but

203
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,440
it's going to cost you a bunch of money

204
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,320
to put some solar panels on your roof or

205
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,800
you can get those solar panels for much

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,760
cheaper put them on your roof but the

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,640
manufacturing has to be done in China or

208
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,200
a lower cost for Vietnam lots of places

209
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,880
how do you think about that question and

210
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,440
what we're going to see going forward

211
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,880
obviously lots of talk about tariffs on

212
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,640
China but people also don't necessarily

213
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,079
want to spend a bundle to put solar

214
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,839
panels on the roof yeah that that's

215
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,480
going to be the conflict within the

216
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,160
Trump Administration so you know in

217
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,880
general trade

218
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,760
is welfare enhancing or or it increases

219
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,959
our aggregate level of of welfare or

220
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,360
earnings so if we move to this more

221
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,839
autarchy type World undoubtedly the cost

222
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,519
of building things is going to go up and

223
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,000
the question is going to be for the

224
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,800
administration whether or not they're

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,920
going to accept that higher cost for

226
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,800
having those jobs at least some types of

227
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,560
jobs more of them in the US but in

228
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,600
general We Believe trade increases the

229
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,279
wealth of the US but not uniformally so

230
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,600
the administration I I believe is is

231
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,760
making a bet that they can by reducing

232
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,240
trade with China or other parts of the

233
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,959
world our aggregate incomes will fall

234
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,640
but the incomes of key constituents may

235
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,800
rise that I mean that's a that's a

236
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,200
really key issue I mean everything

237
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,279
they're talking about doing or almost

238
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
everything they're talking about doing

239
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,720
seems to me to be sort of in

240
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,800
inflationary if we increase gas exports

241
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,839
we're basically connecting American

242
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,519
markets to Global markets and prices

243
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,360
will go up for Americans as a result of

244
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,079
that canceling EV subsidies so musk is

245
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,480
going to be able to raise his prices

246
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,480
because the other guys are going to be

247
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,000
more expensive we're we're eliminating

248
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,120
renewable energy subsidies we're

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,160
introducing tariffs on imported goods

250
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,160
largely from lowincome countries and

251
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,000
like like China we're repatriating those

252
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,279
jobs to a really high wage

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
environment so it's it's going to go up

254
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,720
but you try to look at the Silver Lining

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,480
bringing things out of China means we're

256
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,200
also bringing things out of an economy

257
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,880
that is extremely carbon intensive and

258
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,880
we're going to make them in a

259
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,959
environment here maybe maybe more in

260
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,440
Europe that at least for a while maybe

261
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,120
quite a while is going to be

262
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,839
comparatively low emissions isn't there

263
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,560
a chance then that the

264
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,040
repuation uh of manufacturing to this

265
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,680
country reduces Global emissions maybe

266
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,800
even quite dramatically yeah I I think

267
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,480
there's a few channels where that's the

268
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,560
case one is if China is producing less

269
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,760
stuff that stuff will get produced in

270
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,880
likely a cleaner Energy System that's

271
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,240
what you mentioned you also indirectly

272
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,360
mentioned two others uh which is we're

273
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,200
going to be raising the price of

274
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,360
stuff so we're likely to be buying less

275
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,680
stuff and that is going to put downward

276
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,839
pressure on consumption generally so

277
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,839
that too will push emissions downward

278
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,959
and then that there's the second order

279
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,600
effects which is we're going to be

280
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:16,399
moving things around less as well and

281
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,040
that might have a negative impact on

282
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,320
emissions and by negative I mean a

283
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,519
positive impact meaning on ships and

284
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,880
things fewer emissions yes yeah I mean

285
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,680
another way to reduce the emissions of

286
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,240
course would be to have a carbon tax and

287
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
I know you've right you've thought a lot

288
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,600
about that and would that be a more

289
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,639
efficient thing to do than and try to

290
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,880
you bamboozle everybody into uh doing

291
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,199
what we want them to do certainly in an

292
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,399
indirect way we might be moving in that

293
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:45,600
direction through Europe's carbon border

294
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,639
adjustment mechanism the cbam which is

295
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,399
kind of in a piloting phase right now

296
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,959
where at some point any import into

297
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,360
Europe will be adjusted based on its

298
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:59,720
carbon content and that is creating

299
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,320
pressure by

300
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,639
the countries that were exporting to

301
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,199
Europe to think about adopting their own

302
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,120
carbon taxes and it's also providing

303
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,760
some cover for US policy makers on both

304
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,199
sides of the aisle actually to think

305
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,160
about well if we're going to start doing

306
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,240
tariffs maybe we do tariffs based on

307
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,959
carbon content as opposed to just

308
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,880
Flatout tariffs which would then

309
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,680
potentially augment the impact that that

310
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,760
you mentioned Chris you know 15 years

311
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,760
ago more when you first came to MIT

312
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,760
which I remember uh you had a you had a

313
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,279
big old suburban with a license plate

314
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,480
that read tax CO2 which was I think

315
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,760
supposed to be your calling card as an

316
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,680
economist do you still have that license

317
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,079
plate and what are you driving

318
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,959
now so I do have that license plate and

319
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,120
I'll admit it's still on a very low fuel

320
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,399
efficient car it's on a Ford Bronco one

321
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:04,000
of the new ones I also have as the spare

322
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:06,519
tire cover on the back of it a graph of

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,880
the temperature rise in the globe from

324
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:14,880
1880 to 2023 so so hang on what are you

325
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,560
thinking well so look maybe this is why

326
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,160
I worry so much about how the energy

327
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,519
transition impacts uh Middle America and

328
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,399
parts of the country that academics may

329
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,320
not always concentrate on I grew up in

330
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,920
the Central Valley of California which

331
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,720
even though it's in California it's much

332
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,480
closer to Middle America you know I grew

333
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,600
up hunting and fishing and driving in

334
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,959
the back of pickups and and I frequently

335
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,839
have conversations with that area or my

336
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:46,480
old friends from from high school about

337
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,160
climate change and their skepticism of

338
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,800
the importance of climate change and so

339
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,639
on so that's where I constantly get the

340
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,759
feedback on you know how how does what

341
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,000
we're saying sell to different parts of

342
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:03,199
the country and the other point I often

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,959
make is you know the energy transition

344
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,199
not everyone has to

345
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,440
transition we need them to want to

346
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,360
transition and we're not going to solve

347
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,320
climate change through charity or

348
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,120
through forcing products on consumers

349
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,199
that they don't want we need to design

350
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,000
products that they want and use that are

351
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:27,560
cleaner than they otherwise would have

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,839
my Bronco Burns gasoline if Ford

353
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,560
produced a battery electri version or a

354
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,440
plug-in hybrid version I would be the

355
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,319
first one to buy it and that's a point I

356
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,639
also make is that we need to incentivize

357
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:42,079
the manufacturers to want to clean up

358
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,880
their act but they want to sell cars to

359
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:49,079
us so it at the end of the day it comes

360
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,279
down to designing policies where making

361
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,040
the decision that's right for society

362
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,079
and the person are one of the same I

363
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,800
have to ask you how often do people say

364
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,120
dude you have have like CO2 Emissions on

365
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,480
this graph and you're driving yeah

366
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,720
Professor dude but they may not know

367
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,720
that and you're driving to Bronco what's

368
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,319
going on here oh more than a handful uh

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,639
and it usually happens at the gas

370
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:18,199
station where somebody says isn't that a

371
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,160
little inconsistent with what car you're

372
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:22,600
driving and and then they get a five

373
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,120
minute lecture on no why no it's not

374
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,000
inconsistent and and here's why good to

375
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,040
know so if you see Chris's car in your

376
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,079
neighborhood make sure you have some

377
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,399
time if you start bringing this up

378
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,800
that's right the other great irony of

379
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,279
course that you're driving a Bronco is

380
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,040
they have huge engine problems if they'

381
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,959
made an electric version in the first

382
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,279
place that'd be a much more reliable and

383
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,480
better car yeah yeah certainly

384
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,160
maintenance costs and reliability

385
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,880
electric vehicles are a positive yeah

386
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,040
I'm I'm sort of heartened to see at

387
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,399
least some of the domestic car makers

388
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,240
kind of defending their EV Investments

389
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,360
you know they've built factories theyve

390
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,160
they have co-invested at least in

391
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,480
battery plants and so on retrained their

392
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,079
workforces you know now they're facing

393
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,799
four years where maybe the government

394
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,199
won't quite be the wind in their sales

395
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,559
that it has been but they can't go back

396
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,360
I mean they're not going to write off

397
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,600
tens hundreds of billions of dollars of

398
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,120
investment so maybe we just sort of get

399
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:24,799
over it and it's not so bad a Rob with

400
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,799
the with the optimistic but if it

401
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,400
works my wife hates me when I say these

402
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,000
sorts of things

403
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,840
you know our research does suggest that

404
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,240
we can reallocate money to be more

405
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,240
effective allocating it away from

406
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,679
subsidizing the vehicles to subsidizing

407
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,400
the charging stations so if the Trump

408
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,559
Administration was dead set on no longer

409
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,799
subsidizing the vehicles it is possible

410
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,080
that they could spend even less money

411
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,520
and at the same time get the same

412
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,679
penetration if they transferred more

413
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,720
money toward charging stations but I

414
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,120
haven't seen any discussion of that it

415
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,600
seems like all the discussion has been

416
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,120
we shouldn't support EVS in any way how

417
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,120
could we go

418
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,839
[Music]

419
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,760
backwards back beginning of 2024 you

420
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:29,200
wrote an opinion piece about how

421
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,039
essential it is that when we transition

422
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,840
in terms of energy sources we not leave

423
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,240
people behind

424
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,240
economically and there's been so much

425
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,000
examination and there will continue to

426
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:46,000
be about things Democrats did wrong how

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,520
did they underperform in the 2024

428
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,880
election not just at the presidential

429
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,280
level but uh you know in the Congress as

430
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,960
well and I wonder if you can just talk

431
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,400
about sort of that aspect of it the idea

432
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:03,280
that there is an energy transition going

433
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:06,120
on but that is not evenly felt yeah

434
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,400
that's been a frustration of mine for

435
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,919
quite a long time well before I wrote

436
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,760
that opinion piece we need to get Buy in

437
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,000
from all parts of the country and I've

438
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,760
written a quite a few papers that look

439
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,559
at the potential impacts of an energy

440
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:29,000
transition either on jobs households or

441
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:31,679
energy poverty is the most recent paper

442
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,600
and you know the impacts of the energy

443
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,799
transition are not equally felt and they

444
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,240
predominantly fall on the shoulders of

445
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,360
people living in Middle America and

446
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,000
people living outside of the

447
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,360
cities and this has two effects one is

448
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,880
if we do adopt policies like the

449
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,919
inflation reduction act and we're

450
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,600
actually quote unquote successful those

451
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,400
policies leave a bad taste in the mouths

452
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,720
of people living in in the middle of the

453
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,320
US but the second and potentially more

454
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,640
important impact is it creates an

455
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,360
environment where they're going to

456
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,760
resist those types of policy so and I

457
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,280
think that's what we're seeing in

458
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,159
Congress it's the coastal

459
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,679
Representatives that are pushing the

460
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,960
most for this energy transition and

461
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,679
we're not paying enough attention in

462
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,919
terms of Designing policies that do

463
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,720
disproportionately help Middle America

464
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,799
now we talked earlier about the

465
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,960
inflation reduction act where the money

466
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,919
is going to the red States but I don't

467
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,840
know if that's known I don't I don't

468
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,360
think that is widely known by policy

469
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,320
makers it's taking time for the

470
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,240
inflation reduction act to kick in and

471
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,080
and for the volume of those subsidies to

472
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,919
rise but did we get it wrong with the

473
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,280
IRA I mean could we have done better in

474
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,360
in being more inclusive of red States

475
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:57,080
and and poorer communities I think the

476
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:00,640
IR was a major step forward in terms of

477
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,840
just recogn izing that so under the

478
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,679
inflation reduction act we have energy

479
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:09,400
communities there are a few ways you can

480
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,640
become an energy community based on how

481
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,039
much fossil fuel employment you have

482
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,320
what what's your unemployment rate do

483
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,760
you have a coal mine or a coal plant

484
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,520
that recently shut down so that's the

485
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,360
first bill that I can think of that

486
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,600
explicitly differentiates communities

487
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,200
that have been hit hardest by this trans

488
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,720
transition and if you're an energy

489
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,080
Community your subsidies are are higher

490
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,360
than if you're not we've done some work

491
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,919
that suggests you know you could

492
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,679
certainly make it better I think they're

493
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,039
a little bit too much backward looking

494
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:46,039
and not forward-looking but it's a major

495
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,159
step forward in terms of recognizing

496
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:51,360
that the impact of the energy transition

497
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,679
is not going to be equally felt

498
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,640
therefore maybe the policy should not be

499
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:01,919
equally levied across the US I wonder

500
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,120
how much of this is also you know we

501
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,880
were talking about this before this idea

502
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,320
that a lot of money is going to Red

503
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,799
States and red State Governors but how

504
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,880
much is there a kind of skill mismatch

505
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,960
so you've given this great example

506
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,720
before which I really like and had never

507
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,760
thought about which is we saw a lot of

508
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,840
action from the UAW over the last few

509
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,679
years in terms of a strike unhappiness

510
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,919
with the way they were being paid and so

511
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,279
on but one of the real concerns for the

512
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,799
UAW is that as you transition from

513
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,600
building internal combustion engines to

514
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,880
building electric cars a different set

515
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,880
of skills is needed so I wonder if like

516
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,520
just because you're sending a check to a

517
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,880
red state does that mean that the people

518
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,960
in that state have the skills that are

519
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,760
needed or like outside people coming in

520
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,880
to take those jobs and maybe you can

521
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,640
talk about that a little no that's an

522
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,240
excellent point and I'm going to really

523
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,799
throw out a question because I don't

524
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,159
know the answer to this is are we trying

525
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,080
to protect

526
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:06,840
a geographic region or a person and

527
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,880
those are two very different objectives

528
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,039
right so we can if you think about the

529
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,440
inflation reduction act which is

530
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,799
providing bigger subsidies for specific

531
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,520
regions of the country so that's meant

532
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:21,799
to protect you know Appalachia or the

533
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:25,840
industrial Midwest but that's not

534
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:29,559
helping necessarily that coal miner or

535
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,120
that assembly line worker and I don't

536
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,360
think we have a great idea or great

537
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,679
policies to protect the people yeah that

538
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,720
are impacted so we could protect a town

539
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,360
and we'll no longer have the town

540
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,480
collapse because the automobile plant

541
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,400
shut down but that's not the same thing

542
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,159
as protecting the workers that were at

543
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,279
that plant and obviously it depends like

544
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,640
how we protect those workers depends on

545
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,600
where they are in their life you know it

546
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,640
might be impossible to protect that

547
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,760
65-year-old automobile worker there's no

548
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,919
chance he or she is going to be

549
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,720
retrained to do something or there's

550
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,520
very little chance but maybe that

551
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,039
25-year-old worker that just started we

552
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,000
could think about providing him or her

553
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,360
with the additional skill set that they

554
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
can transfer to another industry of

555
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,320
course that presupposes that they want

556
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,720
another skill set I mean Sarah Smarsh I

557
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,440
don't know she's the recent author of a

558
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,960
book called bone of the bone essays on

559
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,600
America by a daughter of the working

560
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,120
class has been talking about how you

561
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,960
know we have to respect the possibility

562
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,240
that workingclass people want to be

563
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,520
working-class people they don't want to

564
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,679
be reskilled they they don't want to

565
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,039
advance economically necessarily I mean

566
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,799
we're looking at it I mean not to cast

567
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,600
dispersions on your profession we're

568
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,880
looking at the situation Through The

569
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,000
Eyes of an

570
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,120
economist maybe we're getting it wrong

571
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,600
socially and not recognizing that people

572
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,919
have preferences oh yeah and I didn't

573
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,480
mean to imply that we're going to

574
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,520
necessarily change them from being

575
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,640
working class or a union worker or or

576
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,360
whatever but I I'm just thinking that if

577
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,799
I've been trained to be on an assembly

578
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,440
line and that assembly line which EVS

579
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:17,480
take I believe the number is 20% less

580
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:21,039
labor to build them you know can I be on

581
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,919
another assembly line or can I transfer

582
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,159
my skill set to installing heat pumps or

583
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,799
installing solar farm so we can keep

584
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,919
those workers potentially it pretty

585
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:36,520
close to where they were geographically

586
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,480
and skill set wise and and so on but we

587
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,240
need to realize that a lot of the

588
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,960
policies we adopt are really doing a

589
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,000
decent job at protecting locations

590
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,399
rather than individuals and what I don't

591
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,760
see are retraining programs or retooling

592
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:55,480
programs or you know that may not

593
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,440
require too much of a shift from you

594
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,760
know that assembly line to installing

595
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,200
solar panels or heat pumps and so on but

596
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,880
still require some level of retooling is

597
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,919
there any sort of research looking at

598
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,360
you know when a plant opens in North

599
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,080
Georgia and all these new jobs open up

600
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,480
are the people who are taking those jobs

601
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,440
inhabitants or do people come in because

602
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,919
we know like you know when there are

603
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,919
energy booms in like North Dakota lots

604
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,760
of people travel from wherever they are

605
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,640
which is not North Dakota to North

606
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,840
Dakota to participate and then might

607
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,840
leave again when like there's a bit of a

608
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,520
bust in the cycle or what I mean gold

609
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,640
rushes are kind of like that people come

610
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,840
from other places and so I wonder do we

611
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,520
know are those helping the people live

612
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,960
in Georgia or people coming from

613
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,360
wherever yeah I think it depends on the

614
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,279
on the job so the fracking boom you know

615
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,159
we actually have written a couple papers

616
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:57,760
on looking at who was attracted to that

617
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,720
boom and that's by and large you know

618
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,320
men in their 20s those are the ones that

619
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,440
moved to North Dakota but you're not

620
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,960
going to get the 50-year-old man or

621
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,760
woman with a family moving great

622
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,080
distances the moving costs are just grow

623
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,320
exponentially as we as we get older so I

624
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,720
think when that plant opens up in North

625
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,919
Carolina at least the more permanent

626
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,240
type jobs are just pooling predominantly

627
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,440
from people living already near that

628
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,000
area I wonder if you think think you

629
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,440
know there's so much sort of Monday

630
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,360
morning quarterbacking about the

631
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,039
election and about social issues and

632
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,320
about inflation to what degree do you

633
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:43,880
think the issue of the energy transition

634
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,200
and maybe maybe a mishandling of it or

635
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,519
maybe it could have been handled better

636
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,679
to what degree do you think that

637
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,120
factored in or mattered at all in terms

638
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,840
of the decisions people made I I don't

639
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,480
know the answer to that but what I will

640
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,559
say is I think the Democrats have missed

641
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,960
their opportunity and have not handled

642
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:06,159
it well and you know you mentioned a

643
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:09,399
2024 piece I wrote I can remember going

644
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,919
to I think it was a some meeting in in

645
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:16,240
Cambridge Massachusetts in

646
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,399
2018 in the heart of the Democrats and I

647
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,320
remember standing up there saying

648
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,559
Democrats need to start caring about

649
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,519
poor people again because I was

650
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,919
expressing my frustration with the

651
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,480
energy transition which is at that time

652
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:33,360
in particular everything was about

653
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,720
handing money to wealthy people living

654
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,120
in Suburbia whether that was rooftop

655
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:42,919
solar or EVS all of that was focused on

656
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,760
that demographic to get a $7,500 subsidy

657
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,440
for your EV you got to buy an EV that's

658
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,360
that's right that's right and and you

659
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,559
know maybe from a pure climate

660
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,720
perspective if if we just care about

661
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:57,000
maximizing carbon reductions in that

662
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,919
given year that's the right thing to do

663
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
because like you said said Rob you need

664
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,200
a lot of money to buy that EV you need a

665
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,080
roof to put those solar panels on so

666
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,120
you're already pushing toward the upper

667
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,200
part of the income

668
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,440
distribution but that might have been my

669
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,039
opic because I think it might have been

670
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,240
missing the fact that this is a

671
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:23,640
long-term game and we need to get Buy in

672
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:27,279
not just from Eevee or $775,000 car

673
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,720
buyers with roofs we need to get Buy in

674
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,279
from the complete country so simple

675
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,080
question how do we do that how do we how

676
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,679
do you design a policy that isn't

677
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,679
regressive as as the the transition

678
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,320
tends to be because it raises the cost

679
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,559
for energy which is a disproportionately

680
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,000
large fraction of poorer people's

681
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,480
budgets than wealthier people's budgets

682
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,840
how do we do this without always messing

683
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,399
with them yeah yeah well one way is is

684
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,919
what in the long term I think your

685
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,519
longterm point is also really important

686
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,480
right yeah you can't just have answer to

687
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,399
the short term well there you go that

688
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,799
was going to be my first answer and but

689
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,919
my I was going to make the point that

690
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,360
that's not a sustainable policy because

691
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:13,080
it's too expensive we briefly talked

692
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:16,480
about carbon taxes earlier we've shown

693
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,919
that if you structure a carbon tax

694
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,120
correctly 75% of lowincome households

695
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,640
bottom cortile households can make money

696
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,039
off of the policy the question is will

697
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,880
they trust that can we communicate that

698
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:34,720
to them but it's certainly possible to

699
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,760
design policies that actually transition

700
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,320
the economy and are a greater burden to

701
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,640
the wealthy consumers which I think are

702
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,720
are what we're looking for the question

703
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,640
is just how do we build the support for

704
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,600
those

705
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,640
policies another sort of aspect of this

706
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,640
whole transition and of sort of

707
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,279
convincing people

708
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,799
is the issue of convincing people that

709
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,760
it's expensive not to to change policy

710
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,960
or not to transition because there's a

711
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,519
we've focused a lot on like how

712
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,440
expensive it might be right maybe you

713
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,200
have to you maybe you had a job in a

714
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,799
regular assembly line and now you're

715
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,320
going to electric vehicles and that

716
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,600
might cost you your job we've obviously

717
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,080
we've seen a lot of hurricanes and

718
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,360
floods and people who live in Florida

719
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,960
know how expensive it is now to ensure

720
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,679
their homes but yet I didn't really see

721
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,720
that as a part of anything that any

722
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:33,000
candidate anywhere talked about not the

723
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,120
ones I heard there was little very

724
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,720
little discussion about climate I think

725
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,279
in in this last election cycle certainly

726
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,360
at the presidential level but you're

727
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:45,279
exactly right the costs of climate

728
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,000
change are also not uniform we talked

729
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,000
about the cost of the energy transition

730
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,919
not being

731
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,679
uniform and the cost of climate change

732
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,240
are going to fall predominantly on the

733
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,200
south and coastal areas of the country

734
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,559
and how we communicate that is a tough

735
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,720
one because a lot of the costs are in

736
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,440
the future even though we are starting

737
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,159
to see stronger hurricanes slower and

738
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,960
wetter hurricanes and more droughts and

739
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,240
more wildfires and and so on so the

740
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,440
concern though is by the time everybody

741
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,120
realizes how bad climate change is going

742
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,200
to be it's going to be not too late I

743
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,440
hate using that phrase but it's going to

744
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,440
be much later than we would have wanted

745
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,840
to heart's reverse that's for sure yeah

746
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,320
yeah do you think there's an effective

747
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,200
way to make that economic case because

748
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,399
when I think about the places that are

749
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,600
growing the most Florida Texas those are

750
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:46,080
also the places where insurance rates

751
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,600
are going up the most they are

752
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,320
Republican places people were worried

753
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,799
about eggs and the cost of eggs and meat

754
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,960
and like these sort of basic things that

755
00:32:53,799 --> 00:33:00,639
they buy well if you own a piece of

756
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,880
property you probably ensure it yeah I

757
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:04,919
think that we are going to start to see

758
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,320
that and there was a recent paper that's

759
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,960
a NBR working paper that looks at the

760
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,679
reassurance rates and where they're

761
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,039
going up in in the country and it it it

762
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:18,880
is those areas that you mentioned as

763
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,600
well as big chunks of Middle America so

764
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,360
people are going to start to see their

765
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,399
cost go up the question I have is

766
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,200
whether or not they will connect the

767
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,880
dots will they realize that this is

768
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,120
because of climate change and not just

769
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,120
because rates are going up for

770
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,960
everything or or whatever excuse they

771
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,960
give and that's I'm a professor I got

772
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,000
into education for a reason so I I am a

773
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,600
true believer that education matters and

774
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,480
and work here but that's the education

775
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,360
that we're going to have to push out

776
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,159
there in so far as it's credible and

777
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,600
defensible so let's look ahead you're an

778
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,399
economist you care about climate policy

779
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,840
you think a lot about government maybe

780
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:06,320
first what do you expect when you think

781
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,879
about what the next four years will look

782
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,200
like at the intersection of those things

783
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,720
what do you expect to

784
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:18,359
see so I expect to see big chunks of the

785
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,359
inflation reduction act to continue so I

786
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:22,599
I do think we will continue to make

787
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:25,119
movements toward

788
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:27,879
hydrogen demonstration projects around

789
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,280
CCS or building more battery

790
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:37,359
manufacturing plants I also expect that

791
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:41,359
China is going to start sadly dominating

792
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:44,960
in key industries that I wish we had

793
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:48,000
more foresight to support and that in

794
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,800
particular electric vehicles so China by

795
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,119
far is already leading in that space and

796
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,839
the EV future is not going to be

797
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,760
squashed by the next four years the

798
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,000
Trump Administration is not going to

799
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,880
salvage the internal combustion engine

800
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,320
vehicle in the long term it might delay

801
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,200
EV adoption in the US and it might keep

802
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,040
us driving around in gasoline vehicles

803
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,920
but if you look at the rest of the world

804
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,960
they're already moving toward EVS so

805
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,760
this is a critical moment for our

806
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,359
automobile manufacturers to continue

807
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,560
their leadership in the automobile space

808
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:31,240
and my biggest concern over the next

809
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,400
four years is will'll be leapfrogged by

810
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,520
everybody else and that's going to

811
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,320
actually have very long-term

812
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,000
repercussions it really becomes a

813
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,240
competitiveness issue is the way it

814
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,160
sounds like we wake up in four years and

815
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,079
we're like oh well Trump isn't President

816
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,440
anymore but as you say China or whatever

817
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,560
other places are so far ahead of us on X

818
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,720
Y and Z we can't catch up

819
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,640
anymore yeah and the Trump

820
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,480
Administration might be able to s

821
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,280
Salvage you know John Deere or

822
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,000
Industries like that you know were

823
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,319
basically in homing that production but

824
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,839
they're not Global Industries at the

825
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:15,599
same scale as EVS or solar panels and so

826
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:17,400
on so if the Trump Administration is

827
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,760
going to really be

828
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,440
anti- clean technology then that's going

829
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,400
to put us four years behind on those

830
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,359
Industries and by then it might just be

831
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,520
too late so I mean as I I look at the

832
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:33,440
the nominees that that the president

833
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,400
elect is putting forward I'm I'm struck

834
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,880
by how their thinking is somewhat

835
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,440
ideological possibly not science-based

836
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,400
or science informed certainly not the

837
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,160
basis of science informed policy but

838
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,440
that's your thing so what's a guy like

839
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,960
you to do for the next four years you

840
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,640
just sort of retreat and and maybe work

841
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,440
on K2 education or is is there a role

842
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,440
for an outof work Economist or are you

843
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,760
out of work let me uh tag on to that

844
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,160
question in terms of not just what you

845
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,599
are doing for the next four years but

846
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,079
what do you think democrats should do or

847
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,079
think about for the next four years

848
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,359
there's a lot we can't predict but I'm

849
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,000
pretty sure they're not going to be in

850
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,200
power during the next four years but

851
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,520
what should they be thinking about so I

852
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,119
think there's bipartisan support

853
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,599
for

854
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,480
policies that reduce

855
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,280
emissions but the focus of the policy is

856
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,520
on something else and I'll give you an

857
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,839
examp example so we over the past few

858
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,960
months we've been through the new

859
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,640
climate policy Center here at MIT we've

860
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,960
been modeling several bills that

861
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:44,079
subsidize or promote or incentivize more

862
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,240
electricity transmission so those bills

863
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,599
if adopted would have a negative impact

864
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,640
on emission so we would get emission

865
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,400
reductions from being able to move the

866
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,200
electrons from the places where wind and

867
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,640
solar are most effective to where the

868
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,680
people live but what we've also shown is

869
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,400
those bills have huge impacts on

870
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,760
reliability and resiliency in the face

871
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:14,880
of storm so one in particular if you

872
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,760
were to pass that bill and have you know

873
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,920
we simulate a thousand storms across the

874
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,880
US that cut out generation because of

875
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,760
whether it's hurricanes or droughts or

876
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,680
and you can get 70% reductions in the

877
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:33,520
outages face by customers with that

878
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,319
additional transmission so that's a

879
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,520
bipartisan topic right we're all looking

880
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:41,359
for resiliency and reliability in our

881
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,240
electricity grid it has this co- benefit

882
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,240
that it leads to lower emissions there's

883
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,520
also the we talked earlier about the

884
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,920
Border tax adjustments based on carbon

885
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,440
content a republican in a Gulf Coast

886
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,119
State might support that because it

887
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,359
negatively impacts Chinese Imports but

888
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,760
that as Rob was mentioning might shift

889
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:07,359
the things we do buy to cleaner areas of

890
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,920
the world and that would have a benefit

891
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,520
from the climate perspective so I I see

892
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,440
the next four years looking

893
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:20,480
for co- benefits or looking for policies

894
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,560
that improve some other aspect of our

895
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,760
lives but also lead to lower emissions

896
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,720
and I do think there's a lot of room for

897
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,520
those policies do you think they're

898
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,119
going to listen to you is there a forum

899
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,920
or a some sort of channel that you work

900
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:39,800
through so the climate policy Center is

901
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,359
explicitly bipartisan we are actively

902
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,400
having conversations with both sides of

903
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:48,960
the aisle we're looking to work with

904
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,079
both sides of the aisle on understanding

905
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,680
what certain legislation or rules inside

906
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:57,400
of agencies might do to lots and lots of

907
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,359
outcomes so not just carbon emissions

908
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,480
that's our plan is to continue to have

909
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,280
those conversations maybe have more

910
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,079
state level conversations but I do think

911
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,359
there's scope here for passing

912
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,240
legislation that improves the climate

913
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,960
but improves other things that have more

914
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,960
bipartisan

915
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,839
[Music]

916
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,480
