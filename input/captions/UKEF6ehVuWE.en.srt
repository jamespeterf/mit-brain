1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,574
I'm Katharina Ribbeck.

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,609
And I'm Amy Keating.

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:14,314
And it was our pleasure to chair
the program planning committee

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,082
for today's symposium.

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,719
It's incredibly exciting
to see it coming to life.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,456
The hardest part of
this job, by far,

7
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:27,427
was putting together
just a single-day program

8
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,196
from the wealth of
ideas and innovation

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,565
that surround us at MIT.

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:37,137
It is, yeah, really this wealth
of discoveries and innovation

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,205
that makes MIT so exceptional.

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,242
Here we are not just
exploring new frontiers,

13
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,477
we are actively creating them.

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,913
Now we have the
privilege of hearing

15
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:52,218
from four remarkable
early-career-stage faculty who

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:56,189
exactly embody this spirit.

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,024
These rising stars
from chemistry,

18
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,062
biological engineering
and neuroscience,

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,198
are not only expanding
our understanding.

20
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,268
They're taking discoveries
in bold new directions

21
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:12,439
and really influencing the way
we think, the way we innovate,

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,542
and the way we collaborate.

23
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:20,814
So professors Oleta Johnson,
Bryan Bryson, Sara Prescott,

24
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,617
and Sinisa Hrvatin
will share with you

25
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,454
their visions for the
future in four short talks.

26
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,322
Please join us in
welcoming them.

27
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,759
[APPLAUSE]

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,666

29
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,967
Good morning.

30
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,770
I am excited to be here today.

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,305
I'm an assistant professor.

32
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,441
This is my second
year here at MIT,

33
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,212
and my lab is broadly
interested in using chemistry

34
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,647
to direct protein
traffic in cells.

35
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,183
Before I tell you
what that means,

36
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,552
I want to start by
asking you a question.

37
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,489
What do these five
people have in common?

38
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,424
I'll give you three
seconds to think about it.

39
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,861

40
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,897
All right, if you thought
that these people are

41
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:15,602
leaders, innovators, or icons,
I'd totally agree with you.

42
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,439
As it pertains to my research,
they share, unfortunately,

43
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,707
another commonality.

44
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,743
All five of these
people were diagnosed

45
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,312
with a devastating
class of disorders

46
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,549
known as neurodegenerative
diseases, that ultimately robbed

47
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,386
them of the physical and
cognitive faculties that

48
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,723
enabled them to have such
a huge impact on the world.

49
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,393
With that in mind, I invite
you to imagine a world

50
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,062
where a diagnosis with
one of these diseases

51
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:46,933
is not a timer, counting down
to some inevitable decline

52
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,569
in the way that you engage
with those around you.

53
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,307
My lab is working right now to
turn that world into a reality,

54
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,410
and I'll give you an overview
of how we plan to do this,

55
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,346
but first, I want to
be specific about what

56
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,349
these five different diseases
actually have in common.

57
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,386
If you look at the photos
at the bottom of the slide,

58
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:10,190
these are all photos of tissues
from patients that are diagnosed

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,324
with these diseases.

60
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,326
And you'll notice
these dark spots

61
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,062
that are on the
slide in these cells.

62
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,098
Those are proteins
that are aggregated,

63
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,801
a common feature of
all five diseases.

64
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,137
What that means at
the molecular level

65
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,039
is that proteins
that are normally

66
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,909
pretty flexible in a cell
to do their normal function,

67
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,311
they are somehow--

68
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,213
they somehow get
clumped together

69
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,049
in what we call these
protein aggregates.

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,319
We don't always know how they
happen or why they happen,

71
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,622
but I like to think of some
cellular protein highway

72
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,125
where one path gets cut off,
leading to this cellular protein

73
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:46,960
traffic jam.

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,196
Similar to if you were to say
shut down the Sumner Tunnel.

75
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,798
And now there's
a giant aggregate

76
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,700
of cars on the way
to the airport.

77
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,436
With that in mind, it's
important to consider

78
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,439
ways to prevent these
cellular protein traffic

79
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,708
jams from happening
in the first place.

80
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,445
Luckily, there's a protein
that I care about called DNAJB6

81
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,915
that is already very good
at directing protein traffic

82
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,617
and preventing these aggregates.

83
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,287
But as you've seen, it doesn't
always work in these diseases.

84
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,990
Based on what we
know about DNAJB6,

85
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,225
my lab has three
big-picture goals.

86
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,160
We want to develop
new chemical tools

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,696
that we can use to detect
these aggregates earlier

88
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,331
than we can right now.

89
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,967
We want to learn more
about the mechanisms

90
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,204
that DNAJB uses to direct
protein traffic to see

91
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,940
if there's any clues there on
what we could do as chemists.

92
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,510
And we want to discover
chemicals, small molecules that

93
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,314
can work with DNAJB6 to either
activate or mimic its activity

94
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,416
and prevent aggregates
from happening.

95
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,918
And I was really lucky to
recruit three fabulous graduate

96
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,888
students in my first year
to work on these problems.

97
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,992
Cordiana is working on a
fluorescence-based platform

98
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,862
for early detection
of protein aggregates.

99
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:00,233
Aaron is taking really
complicated DNAJB6 structures

100
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,202
and using chemistry to
make them more simple,

101
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,837
to make it easier
for them to study,

102
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,539
for us to study how they work.

103
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,810
And Isha is looking for chemical
detectors that activate DNAJB6

104
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,480
by acting as glues, recruiting
it to a protein of interest

105
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,782
in a disease of interest.

106
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,651
And that's just the beginning,
because last month I

107
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,487
recruited three more
fantastic graduate students

108
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,989
in my group who
are going to work

109
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,091
on three new projects
towards our goals,

110
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,261
and together we hope
that that will result

111
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,564
in better diagnostics and better
therapeutics that, had they

112
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:35,501
existed 20 or 30 years ago,
would give us more time

113
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,103
to learn from the
wisdom of experience

114
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,273
of people like Rosa Parks,
Muhammad Ali, or Stephen

115
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,174
Hawking.

116
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,745
But most importantly, we hope
that the tools that we develop

117
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,781
in my lab could be used to
improve the quality of life

118
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,917
for people who are diagnosed
with these diseases.

119
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,786
Ordinary everyday
people like you and me.

120
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,420
Thank you.

121
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,623
[APPLAUSE]

122
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:07,934

123
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,369
Good morning, everyone.

124
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:14,006
I'd like us to imagine a
world without tuberculosis.

125
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:19,879
This is the Granville mummy,
estimated to be found in 600 BC.

126
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,014
At the time when they
unearthed this mummy,

127
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,150
they thought that the cause
of death for this mummy

128
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,852
was ovarian cancer.

129
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,589
However, in the early 2000s,
researchers found that this

130
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,458
mummy had had tuberculosis.

131
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,027
Fast forward to
the 19th century,

132
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:39,031
where it's estimated that one in
seven individuals was dying from

133
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,166
tuberculosis.

134
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,137
This is an ad from the Christmas
Seals asking you to donate money

135
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,972
to stamp out tuberculosis.

136
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,708
But unfortunately, I'm here to
report that the Christmas Seals

137
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,912
were unsuccessful in this
campaign because today alone,

138
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,349
4,000 people will die from TB.

139
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,118
OK, so what would
be transformative?

140
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,522
What would be transformative
for TB is a protective vaccine.

141
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,991
And this is something
that we do not yet have.

142
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,760
We have one vaccine for TB.

143
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,365
It is over 100 years old, and it
doesn't meet the product profile

144
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,400
needed to end this pandemic.

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,704
However, if we did, it
would change history.

146
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,707
So looking at this graph, this
is TB incidence per million

147
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,445
on the y-axis and
time on the x-axis.

148
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,748
If we do nothing and we
just keep standard of care,

149
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,316
that's the red line.

150
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:34,687
If we had a 60% protective
vaccine and a mass vaccination

151
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,523
campaign, look at
what could happen.

152
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,093
All right, so the question
becomes, how do we get there?

153
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,230
How do we make a
protective TB vaccine?

154
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,598
All right, so
that's the question

155
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,600
that my lab decided to tackle.

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,703
So why aren't we there yet?

157
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,071
We heard about measurement.

158
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,407
I would like to submit to you
that this is a measurement

159
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,942
problem.

160
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,543
So the question
becomes, how do you

161
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,545
design a vaccine
in the first place?

162
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,948
We might all be experts
about designing vaccines

163
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,617
for viral pathogens,
but tuberculosis

164
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,352
is caused by a bacterium.

165
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,322
So when I think about this
problem as an engineer,

166
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,858
I think about the
following question, what

167
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,695
proteins from the bacterium
does the immune system see?

168
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,397
All right, this is an
especially hard problem

169
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,833
in the context of
infection with bacteria

170
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,703
because viruses have
tens of proteins.

171
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,572
TB has 4,000.

172
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:30,276
So it's not that simple just
to say which protein do I pick.

173
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,178
It's actually a
really hard problem.

174
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,281
And to make that problem even
just a smidge more difficult,

175
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,083
we have to do this
in a biosafety level

176
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,820
three environment, which
means that everything just

177
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,624
goes much slower, much more
complicated, and much more

178
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,493
arduous, because this isn't some
place where you can just say,

179
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,962
I want to try something
new and do it tomorrow.

180
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,931
This takes a lot of
effort and energy.

181
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,167
So despite those roadblocks, I'm
really excited to share with you

182
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,870
that we've made significant
inroads to this problem.

183
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,839
OK, so how do we do this?

184
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,375
So work led by an
incredibly talented graduate

185
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,610
student in collaboration
with Forrest White.

186
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,513
We set out to address
the measurement problem,

187
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,016
asking specifically
in human cells

188
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,552
across diverse human
genotypes, if we

189
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,788
infect with TB, what
proteins from the bacterium

190
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,690
are seen by the immune system?

191
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,892
So I'm going to call
this problem solved.

192
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,626
We can do it.

193
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,662
We can do it within days now.

194
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,997
OK, So now the next
question becomes,

195
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,432
if you can make
these measurements

196
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:30,136
and ask what the immune
system sees with bacteria,

197
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,606
can we ask what does
the immune system see

198
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,109
when you give a vaccine,
including those proteins

199
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,477
from the bacterium?

200
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,279
And that's what we've
been able to do now.

201
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,282
So now we can design
vaccines as mRNAs

202
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,452
and within weeks get an answer
about a particular design

203
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,286
that we've made.

204
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,355
And to give you an example
of what we've done just

205
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,658
in the last few years, is we've
made all these different vaccine

206
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,428
prototypes, and I don't have
the time to go through all

207
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,165
the details, but what we can
do now with these measurement

208
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,134
technologies and say, what if
we change just one parameter

209
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,769
about this mRNA vaccine?

210
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,571
How does it change
immune output?

211
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,341
So that's what you're looking at
here on the right graph, where

212
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,910
I'm just showing two vaccine
designs where we just

213
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,548
made a small 100 amino acid
change to the mRNA vaccine,

214
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,818
and we can change immune
output by orders of magnitude.

215
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,355
So while this has seemed like a
millennia-old problem for a very

216
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,991
long time, I'm very optimistic.

217
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,994
I'm incredibly optimistic
because I think we can do this.

218
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,396
So I'll leave you with
a provocative question,

219
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,665
which is, will the
next TB vaccine come

220
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,899
from Kendall Square?

221
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,468
And I think it will.

222
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,971
I'm very encouraged by this
because in the last six years

223
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,108
I think we've done so
much to answer really

224
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,809
a millennia-old problem.

225
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,444
But I think we can
do so much more.

226
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,313
And I think the
momentum is on our side.

227
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:47,947
Thank you.

228
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,150
[APPLAUSE]

229
00:10:51,150 --> 00:11:06,232

230
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,168
Imagine a world where we
understood how our daily stress

231
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,636
was damaging our health.

232
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,438
We could track it
with simple tests

233
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:16,142
and intervene to prevent or
reverse its harmful effects.

234
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,177
In this world, stress
would no longer

235
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,579
silently fuel chronic
disease, wreak havoc

236
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,583
on our mental health, and
reinforce social inequities.

237
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,519
We all face stress
in daily life,

238
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,622
but globally, stress levels
are now at an all-time high.

239
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,624
This Gallup poll asked
people around the world

240
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,125
to self-report
their daily stress

241
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,995
levels as part of a
Negative Experience Index,

242
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,564
and for over a
decade, stress levels

243
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,867
have been consistently
rising, driven

244
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,404
by factors like financial
insecurity, social isolation,

245
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,173
and workplace burnout.

246
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,476
These same studies show that
stress levels are unequally

247
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,779
distributed across different
countries and demographics.

248
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,981
Within the US, stress
levels are highest

249
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,018
in college-age adolescents,
in women, and low-income

250
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,453
and minority groups.

251
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,254
Looking at these
statistics, it's

252
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,224
hard not to feel that we are
living in a pandemic of stress

253
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,860
with marginalized
communities and our youth,

254
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,064
the very future of our nation,
bearing the heaviest burden.

255
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,999
The consequences
of this on society

256
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,435
are massive, damaging not
just our mental health

257
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,037
but our physical health as well.

258
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,139
Children, for example,
who experience

259
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,409
severe early life stress as
measured by high ACE scores,

260
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,778
lose over a decade
of life expectancy

261
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,480
and are at higher
risk for conditions

262
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,450
like cardiovascular disease,
infertility, and cancer.

263
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,854
This association between stress
and worse health outcomes

264
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,889
is also seen in animal models.

265
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,726
For example, early life stress
reduces survival in wild baboons

266
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,429
and cause mice that are
raised in lab environments

267
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,498
to develop predictable
pathologies,

268
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,200
like making their
very hair turn gray.

269
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,570
These observations tell us
that these associations between

270
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,141
stress and worse health outcomes
cannot be explained entirely

271
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,244
by diet, smoking, and access
to health care services.

272
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:02,815
And it begs the question of what
biological processes link stress

273
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,118
to increased disease
and mortality risk.

274
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,320
I'm a neuroscientist,
and my lab studies

275
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,223
how the brain controls essential
functions like breathing

276
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,191
and heart rate.

277
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,560
And we see stress not
just as a feeling,

278
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,664
but as a biological program with
specific purpose and patterns.

279
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,901
When we face a threat, the
brain primes the body for action

280
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,003
by triggering the
sympathetic nervous system

281
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,972
to release norepinephrine,
causing rapid breathing,

282
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,841
a racing heart, and sweating.

283
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,377
These circuits also
signal endocrine centers

284
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,878
like the adrenal
glands to produce

285
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,749
cortisol and other hormones,
keeping the body on high alert.

286
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,051
Cells throughout the body
receive these signals

287
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,953
and are forever changed.

288
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,622
With new tools, we can
now monitor and target

289
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,225
these pathways with
unprecedented precision

290
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,061
to ask which precise
circuits are disrupted

291
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,163
by chronic and severe stress.

292
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,399
How do stress signals
affect different cell types

293
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,101
throughout the body, and how
are these changes remembered

294
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,703
at the molecular scale?

295
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,371
Through this lens,
we can view stress

296
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,275
as a predictable program that
can be tracked and treated.

297
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,745
To understand this, we're
collaborating with other Boston

298
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,850
area labs, using animal models
to control stress exposures,

299
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,619
and then using advanced
imaging and molecular tools

300
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,487
to track within
individual animals

301
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,990
how this rewires brain
activity and disrupts

302
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,692
physiological systems.

303
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,028
These comprehensive data sets
capture a more holistic view

304
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,731
of stress and are helping
us predict causal brain

305
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,267
changes that alter
bodily states and lead

306
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,369
to stress-related disease.

307
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,838
Looking ahead, addressing
this health crisis

308
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,407
requires new perspectives
and solutions.

309
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,911
As for cancer research, we
must both learn core principles

310
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,380
while also embracing
stress' complexity,

311
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,050
and endotypes if we want to
advance precision treatments.

312
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,686
This effort will rest on
pillars of collaboration

313
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,890
across disciplines to better
understand the molecular scars

314
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,926
of stress and to build
evidence-based diagnostics

315
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,928
and interventions
within our community.

316
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,064
And I for one am looking
forward to this bright future.

317
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,466
Thank you all for
your attention.

318
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,869
[APPLAUSE]

319
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:20,653

320
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,854
Good morning.

321
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,188
My name is Sinisa Hrvatin.

322
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,490
I'm honored to be here.

323
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,525
I want you this
morning to imagine

324
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,695
a world in which suspended
animation were possible.

325
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,899
A world in which a 10-year-old
girl suffering an incurable

326
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,335
disease, like
maybe glioblastoma,

327
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,372
instead of imminently dying,
has the choice to enter a state

328
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,609
of suspended animation for
a few years, maybe a decade,

329
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,378
and then wake up at a time
in which there is a treatment

330
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,348
or perhaps even a
cure to that disease.

331
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:54,053
I know this is currently
science fiction, pretty much

332
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,955
complete science
fiction, but what

333
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,590
I want to share with you today
is that there are animals

334
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,860
in nature that have the
ability to enter similar states

335
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,098
and that have the ability
to enter something

336
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,568
like suspended animation that I
think we can learn so much from.

337
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,470
And then learn how
to eventually develop

338
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,639
suspended animation for humans.

339
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,642
So I'll share with you examples
of a few of these animals.

340
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,510
This is the Arctic
ground squirrel.

341
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,013
This animal lives
above the Arctic Circle

342
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,450
at very low temperatures,
and during most of the year

343
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,851
it has a normal
body temperature,

344
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,587
just like you and me,
around 37 degrees Celsius.

345
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,491
But during the winter, it can
survive by entering hibernation,

346
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,227
and it can lower its body
temperature all the way down

347
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,932
to around 0 degrees Celsius,
entering a sleep-like state

348
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,001
that we call torpor.

349
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,637
My laboratory studies
how animals enter torpor

350
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,340
and also how do
their cells survive

351
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,309
at these very low temperatures.

352
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,277
And I want to share with
you a couple of things

353
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,279
that we've recently found.

354
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,349
We identified a
population of neurons

355
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,686
in the brain that
controls torpor.

356
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,357
And remarkably, we can actually
initiate a torpor-like state

357
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,826
even in animals that
don't naturally hibernate,

358
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,995
just by stimulating
these neurons.

359
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,298
So here you can see an
example of a laboratory mouse.

360
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,034
This is a thermal camera image.

361
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,870
It has a body temperature
around 37 degrees Celsius.

362
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,105
But when you stimulate
these neurons,

363
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,940
you can lower the
body temperature

364
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,611
of this animal all the way down
to around 25 degrees Celsius.

365
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,280
Now, this is not as low
as a natural hibernator,

366
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,916
but it's actually
really cold for a mouse.

367
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,019
And we can do this not
only for minutes or hours,

368
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,289
but actually for days to weeks,
showing for the first time

369
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,660
that we can induce a
long-term torpor-like state

370
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,863
in an animal that doesn't
naturally hibernate.

371
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,032
We've also, in a
parallel study, started

372
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,002
looking at how do
hibernator cells survive

373
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,438
at these low
temperatures and seeing

374
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,508
whether we can learn from their
mechanisms to improve human cell

375
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,110
cold survival.

376
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,880
And here you can see an example
of a handful of human cell lines

377
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,750
that don't fare very well
at 4 degrees Celsius.

378
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,153
But then when we take
small molecules that

379
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,090
mimic some of the adaptations
that hibernators have

380
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,059
during hibernation and
treat those cells with them,

381
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,129
we can dramatically improve
their cold tolerance.

382
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,831
And you can
immediately imagine how

383
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:23,335
this could be useful for organ
storage or organ transplantation

384
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,370
and also how
eventually we could use

385
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,874
this to learn how to lower the
temperature of the human body

386
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,976
to lower and lower temperatures.

387
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,412
And finally, perhaps
the greatest example

388
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,482
of suspended animation in nature
are these tardigrades, cute

389
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,251
little organisms that actually
live all over our globe,

390
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,520
from the Arctic
to the Antarctic,

391
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,188
and they have an
incredible ability

392
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,858
to survive being
frozen all the way down

393
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,760
to -150 degrees Celsius.

394
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,563
And they can stay in that
state for months to years

395
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:55,200
and then come out of it
essentially unharmed.

396
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,071
We're trying to understand
how tardigrades survive this

397
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,107
and whether we can transfer
some of those adaptations

398
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,208
to human cells.

399
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,179
Now life on Earth has evolved
incredible adaptations

400
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,148
to survive in
extreme environments,

401
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,617
and I believe that by
studying these animals,

402
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,386
we'll learn to harness
some of the mechanisms

403
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,222
behind these adaptations
to advance medicine,

404
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,525
perhaps even one day open
the door to fantastic

405
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,827
possibilities of space travel.

406
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,531
Now, this work needs to start
with fundamental biological

407
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,331
discoveries.

408
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,700
But in order to develop
this as a technology,

409
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,138
we also need to collaborate with
engineers, chemists, physicists,

410
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:33,906
physicians.

411
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,842
And this is precisely why
there is no place like MIT

412
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,177
to pursue this dream.

413
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:38,844
Thank you.

414
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,214
