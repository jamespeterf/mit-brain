1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,399
okay so using spatial transcriptomics we

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,400
can measure 480 genes inside the cells

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:11,840
in these colon tissues but what about

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,440
the remaining genes so now let's

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,920
introduce a complementary technology to

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,320
spatial transcriptomics called single

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,560
cell transcriptomics or single cell RNA

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,800
sequencing and single cell RNA

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,800
sequencing is also a new technology but

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,119
it's a little older than spatial

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,599
transcriptomics and single cell RNA

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,800
sequencing allows us to measure the

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:38,719
expression of all 20,000 genes inside

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,079
individual cells so how does this work

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,200
uh let's look at the experimental

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,640
workflow together so we're going to

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,960
start with a solid tissue like the colon

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,559
and we're going to take a piece of the

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,920
colon and we're going to take that

20
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,920
tissue and we're going to dissociate it

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,039
into the individual cells that make up

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,559
the tissue so the tissue is being

23
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,079
dissociated into single cells and then

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,719
we isolate those single cells meaning we

25
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,920
spatially separate them this often takes

26
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,680
place by placing the cells inside liquid

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,520
droplets uh the cells are now isolated

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,200
and then we can extract from every

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,720
single cell RNA and this is going to

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,840
tell us which genes are expressed inside

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,720
that single cell now there's a lot of

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,079
details here but maybe the most

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,439
important detail is this step which is

34
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,600
that we have to dissociate the tissue

35
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,119
and so when we dissociate the tissue

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,960
we've lost all spatial information

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,920
meaning we don't know in the colon which

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,920
cell was next to which cell anymore

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,280
because we've broken up the tissue into

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,280
individual cells isolated them and taken

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,520
out the RNA so that's one really

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,360
important thing to uh remember here is

43
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,479
that single cell transcriptomics or

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,680
single cell RNA sequencing does not give

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,719
you any spatial information and that's

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,719
what actually spurred some of the

47
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,479
developments in spatial transcriptomics

48
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,799
which was people wanted to know where

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,880
the cells are in the tissue but this is

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,039
still a very powerful technology because

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,560
we're measuring all 20,000 genes in the

52
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,560
cell so let's finish this up now we have

53
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,080
the RNA that's been extracted from

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,360
single cells and we can use an enzyme

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
from viruses called reverse

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,920
transcriptase to make that RNA molecule

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,280
into a complimentary DNA molecule DNA is

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,560
a much more stable molecule to work with

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,599
and we can make many many copies of it

60
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,680
which is what's needed to carry out next

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,080
Generation sequencing and in Next

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,440
Generation sequencing we read out the

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,680
sequence of the DNA and that's a T C's

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,040
and G's and once we've read out that

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,160
sequence we can go and look up What gene

66
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,239
that sequence came from because as I

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,400
said earlier the entirety of the human

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
genome has been sequenced so we know

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
where all the genes are in the genome

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,800
what their sequences are and to some

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,480
extent what those genes do so once we

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,519
look up these sequences we can say you

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,040
know what Gene was expressed in what

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
cell so this is the type of data you

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,360
would see from a single cell RNA

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,360
sequencing experiment where the row are

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,480
each of the 20,000 genes in the human

78
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,959
genome and uh the columns are individual

79
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,440
single cells and for each cell I can

80
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,360
tell you how many times I counted a gene

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,959
transcript so in cell one for instance I

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,120
counted the gene transcript for a tcf7

83
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,280
three times versus in cell three I never

84
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,840
saw it in contrast uh in cell one we

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,840
don't see very many copies of epcam the

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,879
epithelial cell marker but we see a lot

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,799
of copies in cell 3 and so this

88
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,360
generates a very large data set you know

89
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,760
you have 20,000 genes we can look at

90
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,400
10,000 or 100,000 cells at once so you

91
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,400
have millions and millions of entries

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,879
here so this is a really really rich

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
data set so now let me give you an

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,519
example of single cell transcriptomics

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,680
applied to Uli colitis so this is a

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,599
study uh performed by Dr romik Xavier

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,920
who is one of the organizers of this

98
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,360
Challenge and he's at Mass General

99
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,840
Hospital and the Bro Institute and in

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,480
this study the Xavier group took uh

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,040
patients with ulcerative colitis and

102
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,439
took tissue biopsies and prepared each

103
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,920
of those biopsies for single cell

104
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,239
transcriptomics so now every single cell

105
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,560
that comes from this uler of Kida sample

106
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,480
is going to have 20,000 genes expression

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,639
measured so every single cell is a

108
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,359
vector of 20,000 measurements and we

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,280
have thousands of these cells and here

110
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,400
we're showing these cells projected into

111
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,919
a low-dimensional embedding called TSN

112
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,919
this is a nonlinear dimensional

113
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,919
reduction technique and the idea of this

114
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,919
technique is that if two cells have

115
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:34,639
similar gene expression in the high

116
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,160
dimensional space then when we show them

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,000
in the TS and embedding in two

118
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
Dimensions those two cells are going to

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,960
be close to one another in that uh

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,160
embedding so here we have uh the cells

121
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,360
colored by the cell type and if we look

122
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,280
at this blue cluster here we see that

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,080
the genes that are being expressed here

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,600
Mark B cells and if we look at the uh

125
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,320
kind of pinkish cluster we see these

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
genes are uh expressed normal in t-

127
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,199
cells and finally in this green cluster

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,520
we see genes that Mark myoid cells so

129
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,960
this is a good way of sort of looking at

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,759
single cell data and what you can really

131
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,840
recognize is that we're getting you know

132
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,080
thousands of cells and lots of data

133
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,479
because we're getting 20,000 genes per

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
cell so this is a really high

135
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,080
dimensional data set and again we're

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,360
getting 20,000 genes and not just the

137
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,919
480 genes that you would normally

138
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,680
measure doing a spatial transcriptomics

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,560
experiment okay so now let's recap what

140
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,479
you've learned uh these three sections

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
of lecture two uh the first thing we

142
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,120
talked about is that gene expression

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,360
programs are groups of genes that are

144
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,280
expressed together during a biological

145
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,160
process and that they can dramatically

146
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,160
change as we go from Health to disease

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,000
so comparing normal colon to ulcer

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,240
colitis or normal colon to colorectal

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
cancer the gene expression programs have

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,360
dramatically

151
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,680
changed and then the second thing that

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
you've been seeing is that there are

153
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,960
many technologies that we can use to

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,400
profile and measure human tissues so

155
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,479
we've introduced uh what PA ologists do

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,319
which is take tissue and stain with h&

157
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,880
to look at tissue structure we've

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,960
introduced the zenium spatial

159
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,199
transcriptomic experiment where we're

160
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,840
able to measure 500 genes and their

161
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,759
locations in space in the tissue and

162
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,240
we've introduced single cell RNA

163
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,560
sequencing or single cell

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,039
transcriptomics where we can measure the

165
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
expression of 20,000 genes in a Cell

166
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,280
however we lose the spatial information

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
so I think what you probably appreciate

168
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,080
is that each of these Technologies has

169
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,960
different strengths and weaknesses

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,520
and a common approach we take in biology

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,800
is to apply multiple Technologies to a

172
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
tissue in order to leverage the strength

173
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,000
of each technology and get a more

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,759
holistic view of what's happening in the

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,960
tissue and what's going wrong in

176
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,479
disease so we've covered at this point

177
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,080
biology and technology and in the next

178
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,400
lecture series we're actually going to

179
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,680
go into what data you will be provided

180
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,960
with during the competition and what the

181
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,840
actual crunches are what are the actual

182
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,319
problems going to be working on with

183
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,319
these data sets
