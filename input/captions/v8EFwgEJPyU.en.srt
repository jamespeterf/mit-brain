open cours whereare I sort of like to

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,960
emphasis emphasize my own view that the

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,160
best is still yet to

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,680
come in 2001 MIT made an extraordinary

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,480
commitment to publish in electronic form

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,920
the teaching materials we use in

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,320
virtually all our courses the entire

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,760
undergraduate and graduate curriculum of

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,559
this institution

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,879
and we committed to make those materials

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,720
freely and openly available for any

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,280
non-commercial purposes including giving

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,799
people the right to reuse them to modify

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,360
them and to repurpose them in in other

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,560
ways for educational and research

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,960
purposes today a little more than six

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,159
years later we're here to celebrate the

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,479
Fulfillment of that initial promise this

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,759
accomplishment was possible because of

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,079
the dedication of the MIT staff and

37
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,799

made open courseware a global movement

58
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,080
rather than just an MIT

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,680
project some are representatives from

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,239

stimulating and

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,360
fascinating discussion about the

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,519
potential that open course wereare can

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,200
unlock as we make knowledge available

94
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,200
globally and more accessible to around

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,239
the

96
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,599
world this afternoon we'll revisit the

97
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,599
path MIT took to reach this moment

98
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,079
explore the impact of open courseware uh

99
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,200
on the world and on education here in

100
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,799
the United States and abroad and look to

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,400
the future of open course Weare and

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,079
education both both in the short term

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,000
and in the longer term we're fortunate

104
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,720
to have here as our keynote speaker

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,680

107
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,479
detail later but he'll talk about

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,479
individual empowerment and how the

109
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,680
internet and Innovative usage such as

110
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,440
open course where of that technology are

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,639
making a difference for people around

112
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,720
the world we're also going to have a

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,680
panel of distinguished academics

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,800
researchers and scientists that will

115
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,919
include Hal abson Charles vest John cely

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Brown and Sam patroa and they'll help us

117
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,039
explore the implications and the future

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,479
possibilities of open

119
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,960
courseware later this afternoon we'll

120
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,840
also announce the launch of a new and

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,560
exciting MIT open course Weare

122
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,919
Initiative for secondary education yet

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,560
another chapter in the growing story of

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,759
what happens when we make course

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,560
materials accessible and freely

126
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,400
available but first let me introduce the

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,720
president of MIT Dr Susan hawfield she

128
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,199
serves as mit's 16th president and'll

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,479
give she'll give us her reflection as an

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,120
open course whereare I'd like to mention

131
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,080
I went back uh to her inauguration

132
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,199
materials uh I was involved in that and

133
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,120
I recalled that the theme of her

134
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,880
inauguration festivities the sort of

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:27,360
tagline was this sort of catchy phrase

136
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,000
uncommon in commmon which tried to evoke

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,319
what's uncommon about the place and what

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,280
we share in common with each other at

139
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,160
MIT and elsewhere around the world I can

140
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,360
think of almost nothing we've done at

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,680
MIT that better embodies that tag phrase

142
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,560
than open

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,039
courseware uh as someone will tell you

144
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,280
later over 90% of the faculty of MIT

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,160
have actually donated materials the air

146
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,479
course materials it's something we have

147
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,199
in common and the uncommonness of the

148
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,720
decision of MIT in around

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,400
2201 to take those materials and make

150
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,520
them freely accessible is truly uncommon

151
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,639
so with that I'm going to turn this over

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,639
to

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Susan thank you Steve uh it is a great

154
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,880
joy to be here today for the celebration

155
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,240
of where we are and the celebration of

156
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
where we're going to go um I want to

157
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,280
begin my comments by thanking our

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,919
faculty uh the MIT faculty as Steve just

159
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,199
said they invented open courseware and

160
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,280
they've made it the ESS that it is like

161
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,319
um so much of MIT it's also true for

162
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,599
open course where our faculty are the

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,919
real stars of our show um it was a

164
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,680
committee of Faculty from MIT uh that

165
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,840
first proposed the idea of open course

166
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,639
Weare in

167
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,840
2000 and since then Steve just said

168
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,599
about 90% of the MIT faculty have

169
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,080
participated

170
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,479
voluntarily by contributing their

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,680
teaching materials uh to the free and

172
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,639
open their free and open publication in

173
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,960
ocw now I have say i' say voluntarily

174
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,560
this is the nature by which we do the

175
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,919
work of the University our faculty do

176
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,680
things voluntarily and it is simply

177
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,039
wonderful that our faculty chose to

178
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,879
participate in open course were at such

179
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,120
a level um it's a remarkable level of

180
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,319
participation 90% I'm not sure there are

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,680
many things or even one or two things

182
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,720
that you could say all of our faculty

183
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,520
have chosen to do in unison the way they

184
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,560
have chosen to participate in open

185
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,000
courseware um and it really underscores

186
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,400
is the dedication of our faculty to

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,080
mit's teaching Mission often people

188
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,879
think of a place like MIT which is a

189
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,199
very profound research Mission and

190
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,520
imagine that our faculty are only

191
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,919
devoted to the research m mission but we

192
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,560
are enormously benefited by our

193
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,319
faculty's dedication to the teaching

194
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,759
Mission and they take this

195
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,680
responsibility very seriously our

196
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,120
faculty are passionate about teaching

197
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,800
and they're remarkably good at it over

198
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,360
the years this has been reflected in the

199
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,840
admiration MIT students have for their

200
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,680
professors and since open course were

201
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,520
launched we've seen that kind of

202
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,759
admiration reflected in the comments of

203
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,440
people who have used open courseware

204
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,599
around the world in addition to the

205
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,720
faculty our students have played a

206
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,599
seminal role in open courseware they've

207
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,479
been integral to its success um both as

208
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,759
ocw staff and as

209
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,440
collaborators MIT students have helped

210
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,759
to publish the faculty materials and

211
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,360
have contributed content as part of two

212
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,120
of our International programs the MIT

213
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,120
international science and technology

214
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,000
initiative which we call Misti which is

215
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,320
a program where we place MIT students

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,399
around the world and a second program

217
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,360
called the Africa internet technology

218
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
initiative both of these are essentially

219
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,240
summer programs MIT students have

220
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,920
traveled to China and to Africa to teach

221
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,480
courses at other youth universities

222
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,399
using open courseware materials in fact

223
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,360
what they've done in distant

224
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,880
universities is help the faculty of

225
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,720
those universities understand how they

226
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,640
can use open coursework in their courses

227
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,880
and last but not least um our students

228
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,079
have themselves encouraged faculty to

229
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,000
participate in ocw at a level that um we

230
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,560
could never have achieved without

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,200
them this kind of student faculty

232
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,640
collaboration is really at the heart of

233
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,360
MIT now in addition to the students and

234
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,320
the faculty there are many an enormous

235
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,040
number of individuals advisor

236
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,720
institutional partners and of course the

237
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,360
ocw staff who deserve our thanks for

238
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,480
their remarkable dedication to ocw and

239
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,640
to the realization of its promise that

240
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,040
we're celebrating today now there's

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
excuse me a special section in your

242
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,680
program where we list the people and I

243
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,079
would uh uh send your attention to that

244
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,120
as a way of understanding who and how

245
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:49,200
many participated in this but I do want

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
to mention just a few people by name

247
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,560
whose extraordinary contributions and

248
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,279
Leadership really had an a huge impact

249
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,120
on

250
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,880
ocw first I want to call out the faculty

251
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,440
leaders uh I think many of if not most

252
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,240
of them are here dick U Hal abbl Steve

253
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,920
lurman Tom magnanti and chera M migawa

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,079
without their Visionary contributions

255
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,560
and I'm flagging support the ocw project

256
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,880
would not have become what it is today

257
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,680
and I would just ask these faculty

258
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,680
leaders please to stand so we can thank

259
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,880
them um believe it or not institu

260
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,680
leaders sometimes have a role in what

261
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,320
happens that's good at a university and

262
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,480
there are two past institutional leaders

263
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,680
who were exceptional and absolutely

264
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,920
unwavering champions of ocw from its

265
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,639
initial concept to its Inception and

266
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,360
through its initial stages MIT president

267
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,000
ameritus Chuck vest now president of the

268
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,839
National Academy of engineering and and

269
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,160
former proost of MIT Bob Brown who's now

270
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,639
president of Boston University were

271
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,839
tireless Advocates of ocw both on and

272
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,120
off campus their leaders ship was

273
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,839
instrumental in securing the funding

274
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,880
that allowed MIT to get started and you

275
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:10,000
know I'm bringing early Skeptics of the

276
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,680
program on campus to understanding some

277
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,959
of the opportunities that ocw presented

278
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,360
uh I don't think Bob is here but Chuck

279
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,360
is and let's thank Chuck

280
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:29,760
also and last in this line of individual

281
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,399
recognition is uh ocws found found in

282
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,639
executive director an

283
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,519
marges uh an much to our sadness but joy

284
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,079
in her next opportunity she left MIT

285
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,440
earlier this fall to take a role in

286
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,880
public service with the Commonwealth of

287
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,720
Massachusetts she has taken on another

288
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,880
opportunity for transformation another

289
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,560

govern now what you're going to hear

298
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,120
about today you're a lot of numbers

299
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,680
reflecting the use of open course Weare

300
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,000
and you know numbers um after numbers

301
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,000
after numbers that Express the success

302
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,199
and the penetration of ocw into you know

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,279
the minds and lives of many I would just

304
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,760
provide one anecdote Everywhere I Go

305
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,160
over the world people provide me with

306
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,440
ocw anecdotes and um you know they

307
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,240
capture in interesting ways this spark

308
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,079
of curiosity that got lit the

309
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,959
satisfaction of an educational desire uh

310
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,240
that was made um uh one uh insight into

311
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,720
the impact of ocw actually comes um from

312
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,600
my daughter who is of that young

313
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,800
generation who is you know lives out

314
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,519
there on the frontier of Technology um I

315
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,839
only visit the frontier through her and

316
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,560
our students um I'm not out there myself

317
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:03,160
I'm too old um but in the middle midd of

318
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,959
September I was on a a a trip and I got

319
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,519
um I was talking to our daughter on the

320
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,920
telephone and she said mom you've got to

321
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,680
go on iTunes video this is not a site

322
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,639
that I have bookmarked I can tell you um

323
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,040
you said you what you'll find on iTunes

324
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,680
video are some uh MIT courses but what

325
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,839
she was pointing out to me is that

326
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,399
iTunes video does um a best 10 a top 10

327
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,360
ranking it's always changing telling you

328
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,560
what the top 10 courses are top 10

329
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,360
courses the top 10 videos are now you

330
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
all probably know that iTunes has a

331
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,480
segment of the of the site that's iTunes

332
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,040
U so iTunes University this is not

333
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,120
iTunes University I'm talking about I'm

334
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,560
talking just about iTunes video um for u

335
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,360
a week or two I don't know how long it

336
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,360
lasted but certainly for the middle week

337
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,399
in the middle of September um there were

338
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,320
two open course Weare sites videos that

339
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,079
were rank ranked in the top 10 guess

340
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,720
what they were number three was

341
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,720
classical mechanics we know it as 801

342
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,360
number

343
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,759
seven differential equations

344
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,399
1803 go figure I

345
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:13,839
mean what this expresses to me is the

346
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,959
hunger in this world for Quality

347
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,440
education the hunger for great

348
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,440
educational materials and I would say

349
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,040
and reflect on that is our joy in having

350
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,800
provided ocw to a world that is using it

351
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,160
so so one so wonderfully um we're

352
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,120
delighted that all of you have joined us

353
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,680
this afternoon thank you for coming uh

355
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,880
you for coming to partner with us as we

356
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,079
reflect on open course where and its

357
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,560
impact and we also think about uh where

358
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:47,000
ocw might take us in the future now the

359
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,639
story of ocw is best told by The Faculty

360
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,360
who created it and the individuals who

361
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,600
use it so we will begin the afternoon

362
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,040
with a short video that tells you a

363
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,199
little bit more about Open course we

364
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,199
thank you
