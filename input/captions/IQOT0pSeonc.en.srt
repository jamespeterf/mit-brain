1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,795
Whatever I've done, I've had to explore

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,798
through myself, through my own experience.

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:11,261
So creating my own path has been rewarding.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,848
But has been challenging
also because you don't have

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,643
a straightforward line to follow.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,980
I am from Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico.

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,984
It's a coastal city
in the southeast of Mexico.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,572
growing up there really changed me
or really put,

9
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,658
a stamp in my,

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,412
in my growing up. For example,

11
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,124
seeing all the inequalities that existed

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,379
shaped me in a way that I wanted to,
to help, to improve that.

13
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,216
I've always wanted to
and thought about being an entrepreneur.

14
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:55,472
the logic was you will create a company
that will do good and will help people.

15
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,893
I understood from the beginning
that in order to help, you need resources.

16
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:04,981
The way of being an entrepreneur was a way
of creating those resources. So I think

17
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,819
creating a company in my hometown
was important because I had the chance

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,073
to do something that could be meaningful

19
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:18,328
to the ecosystem and to the local economy
and be able to, in that sense,

20
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,747
try to help improve something.

21
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,876
I knew no women in my hometown

22
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,921
that did a master's degree in,

23
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,924
in an institution like MIT.

24
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,720
I couldn't relate myself
to someone that have been here

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,807
before that I could see myself in the future.

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,477
So I had to figure it out.
How to do it by myself.

27
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,145
And it took me some time.

28
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,315
My presence here, it's a privilege.

29
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:52,904
I would like that privilege
to be shared with other young women

30
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,741
and not so young women
that have the curiosity

31
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,451
to explore this path.

32
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,830
Your talent combined with your passion

33
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,041
are the best recipe to bloom

34
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:08,124
and to flourish in an ecosystem like this.
