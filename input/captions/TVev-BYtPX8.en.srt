1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,920
well I'm very very to have happy to have

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,320
C and V student here who's going to talk

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,559
to us about factoring soling factoring

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,120
with quantum computers uh hi everyone

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,639
thanks very much for having me uh my

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,359
name is SE and I'm going to say a bunch

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,720
of things about Quantum factoring uh so

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,039
actually this talk is going to have two

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,519
parts so the first part is going to be

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,439
uh an overview of what we know about

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,680
Quantum factoring and the main thing I

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,080
want you to take away from that is that

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,480
even though uh the first breakthrough

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,840
happened 30 years ago there's still a

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,119
lot of stuff that's been happening since

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,000
then and there's in fact been a lot of

17
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,280
exciting developments just in the last 2

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
years and then the second part is going

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,320
to be a result that I have with some

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
collaborators who are all here which I'm

21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,079
really happy about and that's just as a

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,879
quick teaser that's going to show how to

23
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,360
quantumly factor some integers in

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,079
sublinear space on a quantum computer so

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
we'll get that but let me start with

26
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,120
history so uh let's start from the

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,160
beginning uh there is a crazy amount of

28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,480
money going towards Quantum Computing uh

29
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,719
the government's throwing a ton of money

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,480
at it startups are getting a lot of

31
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,239
money for it and also big Tech firms

32
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,600
like Google and IBM uh investing uh

33
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,880
significant amounts of effort into

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,840
building a large quantum computer so let

35
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,720
me start with a very simple question why

36
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,640
and I would say the answer uh to put it

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,880
simply is that there are some problems

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
that quantum computers could solve that

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
we believe are completely uh intractable

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,720
to solve with a classical computer um in

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,240
fact even a classical super computer but

42
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,920
as soon as a quantum computer comes into

43
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,640
the picture they become a lot easier and

44
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,680
um I would say this is kind of the main

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
reason why there's so much excitement

46
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,600
because they have something very unique

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,520
to provide and I would kind of view the

48
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,000
poster child of kind of this Quantum

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,439
classical Gap as being the integer

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,840
factorization problem so given a

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,240
gigantic integer that I'm going to

52
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,920
denote by Big N I want you to find its

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,600
prime factorization in time that's

54
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,280
polinomial in its length in bits so as a

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
very simple example if the input's 35

56
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,600
I'm going to want the algorithm to tell

57
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,719
me that it's 5 *

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,159
7 and classically uh we've actually you

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,159
know people have worked on this problem

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,079
for decades uh it's been of Interest

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,159
maybe for

62
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,000
centuries uh but the State of Affairs

63
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,800
has kind of been stuck for uh over 30

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,440
years now we have this kind of 2 to the

65
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,720
end to the 1/3 algorithm and that's kind

66
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,080
of the end of the story which is much

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,599
much slower than polinomial time um and

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,200
it turns out uh as I'll get into later

69
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,319
that the story completely changes if you

70
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,360
allow Quantum algorithms uh Shaw in 1994

71
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,200
showed that you can actually uh run a

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,400
Quantum algorithm that does this in

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,000
polinomial time so a massive massive gap

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,720
between the Quantum and classical

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,200
difficulty of this

76
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,040
problem uh so let me you know if you're

77
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,440
not interested in integer factorization

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,360
let me tell you a couple of reasons why

79
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,840
you should still care about this problem

80
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,879
so the first one and I think the one

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,360
that kind of gets most of the buzz is

82
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,280
breaking cryptography so uh we just

83
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,239
heard from Alexandra kind of what this

84
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,560
setup looks like we have Alice and Bob

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,319
and she wants to send a message to Bob

86
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,400
and what we want is for uh the message

87
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,840
to be encrypted um so so so that like

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,120
say an EES dropper in the middle who

89
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
sees the encrypted message has no idea

90
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,360
what's being sent but Bob on his side

91
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,040
can decrypt and um find out what Lis

92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,599
Senter so uh there are a few proposed

93
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,560
ways of doing this uh one of these is

94
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,239
called the RSA public key crypto system

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,000
that's rsna on the right and this is

96
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,480
kind of uh built uh the security of this

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,840
is built assuming that it's hard to

98
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,640
factor large integers so uh as Alexandra

99
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,040
said the scientists might be sad that we

100
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,920
don't know how to factor on a classical

101
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,680
computer but that made the

102
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,680
cryptographers happy

103
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,560
um then Along Comes a quantum computer

104
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,680
and the story flips now the scientists

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
are happy and the cryptographers are sad

106
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,680
um why is that if the E dropper had a

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,920
large quantum computer they could Factor

108
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,640
the large integer and then the security

109
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,439
is completely dead they can see exactly

110
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,879
what Alice sent Bob um so no good so

111
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,760
this is kind of maybe the kind of most

112
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,840
popularized

113
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
implication uh the second more subtle

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,720
implication that I want to get into is

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
proofs of quantumness so the setting

116
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,519
here uh is that like there is a large

117
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,000
company and they have built a gigantic

118
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,280
quantum computer they're really excited

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,920
uh and they um you know they put out a

120
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,400
press release they put out a paper um

121
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,000
but Alice uh is maybe like you and me

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,239
and just has a humble laptop and she

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,840
doesn't know whether to believe this

124
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,959
company that for neutrality I'm going to

125
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:24,360
call XYZ ABC Labs um and uh the question

126
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,080
is if Alice is skeptical what can this

127
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,520
company do to convince Alice that they

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,120
really have built a quantum computer and

129
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,680
one answer given everything I just told

130
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,919
you is to factor a large integer of

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,320
Alice's choice so Alice uh picks a

132
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,800
gigantic integer of her choice and sends

133
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,479
it along to the company and it's going

134
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,240
to be much much bigger than 10 digits

135
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,199
but uh bear with me I need to fit this

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,080
on the slide um so they the company gets

137
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,759
this and if they had a large quantum

138
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,360
computer they should be able to run

139
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,520
Shaw's algorithm and send back a

140
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,120
factorization to Alice and once they've

141
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,560
sent the factors it's easy for Alice to

142
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,160
multiply the numbers and check that they

143
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,000
did this correctly and at this point if

144
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,440
they didn't have a quantum computer as

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,960
far as we know it should be completely

146
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,240
infeasible for them to factor this

147
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,000
massive integer that Alice has sent them

148
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,720
so if they actually do succeed then

149
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,520
Alice kind of has no choice but to throw

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,000
our hands up and say okay fine I believe

151
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,840
you so this is what uh I mean by a proof

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,880
of quantumness and factorings ALS

153
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,319
factoring also gives us um a way to set

154
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,000
up a proof of

155
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,000
quantumness and the third implication um

156
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,960
is maybe a little tangential for a

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,440
crypto security day but Let Me Entertain

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,759
You anyway it's just intellectual

159
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,600
curiosity I think um and the reason this

160
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,919
is important is that we could get to the

161
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,919
point where uh we've built a large scale

162
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,600
quantum computer but by that point we've

163
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,800
migrated to post Quantum cryptography

164
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,919
anyway so there's no longer a security

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
threat um but the the proof of

166
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,160
quantumness application still stands and

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,880
I would also argue that this is a really

168
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,560
nice problem for kind of understanding

169
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,120
what we can and can't do with quantum

170
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,160
computers and I think one uh question

171
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,000
that I particularly like a lot is kind

172
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,080
of what uh what kind of structure in an

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
integer makes it easier to factor we

174
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,560
have a very good handle on this um

175
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,840
question classically but quantumly we

176
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,120
don't really have much to show for it in

177
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,599
fact what I'm going to get into in the

178
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,120
second part of my talk is kind of an

179
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,880
overview of what we know in terms of

180
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,800
this

181
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
question uh so that's kind of why you

182
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,440
should care about factoring now let me

183
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,440
turn to the State of Affairs so Shaw's

184
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,560
algorithm came out in 1994 so that means

185
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,240
we've known for over 30 years that if we

186
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,240
had a large scale computer we could

187
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,680
Factor large integers and break RSA

188
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,440
cryptography um but it turns out that uh

189
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,759
we can't Factor large inages on a

190
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,560
quantum computer and RSA cryptography is

191
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,280
still as far as we know secure um in

192
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,479
real life and the reason for this is

193
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,800
that there's this very small problem

194
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,840
that no one's actually managed to build

195
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,199
this quantum

196
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,400
computer and uh why is that I don't

197
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,639
really have time to get into why but let

198
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,440
me kind of give you this kind of vague

199
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,639
uh sentence by Craig gney that I think

200
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,240
does Justice to it which is that kind of

201
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,720
our Quantum data is just constantly

202
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,440
trying to disintegrate and running any

203
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,919
Quantum algorithm or carrying out any

204
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Quantum computation is kind of like

205
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,039
trying to ride in the sand and it's just

206
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,240
constantly getting blown away by the

207
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,800
wind um so uh super annoying and so I

208
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,240
think if we want to change this state of

209
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,440
affairs and actually carry out

210
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,360
complicated uh calculations on a quantum

211
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,560
computer we kind of need three things to

212
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,919
happen together so the first one is that

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,560
this writing in the sand is really a

214
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,400
physical problem so the first thing we

215
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,120
need is Hardware improvements in terms

216
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,240
of how we represent Quantum data

217
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,680
physically the second thing we need is a

218
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,840
thing called Quantum era correction

219
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,440
which uh I won't get into but you can

220
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,599
basically think of it as a way to

221
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,319
recover and figure out what happened

222
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,720
before the wind blew away whatever you

223
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,800
were trying to ride in the sand and the

224
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,759
third thing is uh Quantum algorithmic

225
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,479
improvements so yes we already have

226
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,599
polinomial time algorithms for factoring

227
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,759
and that's great um but given the fact

228
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,759
that we're having so much trouble

229
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,319
scaling quantum computers if we could

230
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,159
come up with even faster Quantum

231
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,599
factoring algorithms we're then asking

232
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,319
less of the hardware engineers and the

233
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,280
quantum era correction researchers and

234
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,879
so I think improvements are needed in

235
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,280
all of these directions to make progress

236
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,720
and the axis that I'm going to talk

237
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
about and what I've worked on is the

238
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,680
third category so Quantum algorithmic

239
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,800
improvements so that's what I'm going to

240
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,919
focus on for the rest of this

241
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,479
talk um before I kind of get into a

242
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,360
history of kind of what we know about

243
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,120
factoring let me set up some efficiency

244
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,680
metrics like you know what should be in

245
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,639
your mind when you think about a Quantum

246
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,879
circuit and uh many of you might have

247
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,360
seen classical circuits and I kind of

248
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,680
want you to think of it as the same

249
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,759
thing except that you're now applying

250
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,719
reverse logic reversible logic gates to

251
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,159
a fixed number of wires so with the

252
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,880
classical logic gate you know you take

253
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,560
two input wires and then out comes a

254
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,080
completely fresh third output wire um

255
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,640
that's not the case with a Quantum gate

256
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,760
it's going to act on a fixed number of

257
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,080
wires that are start off in some input

258
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,200
State and then it ends in an output

259
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,000
state so in the bottom left I've shown

260
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,839
like one example of a Quantum logic gate

261
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,279
this is a gate that takes three y's as

262
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,160
input and EXO the third bit with the end

263
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,720
of the first two bits so you could kind

264
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,720
of think of this as the quantum analog

265
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,200
of an end gate but uh this is how how we

266
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,959
kind of represent Quantum circuits and

267
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,519
I'm going to focus for Simplicity today

268
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:09,120
on two efficiency metrics so the first

269
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,760
one is Gates which is the number of

270
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,800
Elementary operations or circles in this

271
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,240
um Quantum circuit on the right and the

272
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,480
second metric is space so the number of

273
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,320
wires or lines and uh classically it's

274
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,640
not too common to uh sweat all that much

275
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,320
about space complexity it turns out for

276
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,920
kind of the scalability reasons I hinted

277
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,200
at earlier this is super important

278
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,839
quantumly so I'm going to stick to these

279
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,560
two metrics um uh for the rest of the

280
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,120
talk okay so with that history so um as

281
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,320
I said the story starts with Shaw's

282
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,440
algorithm in 1994 and what he showed is

283
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,440
that uh you can Factor any integer Big N

284
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,560
um and I'm using little n to note its

285
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,040
length in bits and the number of gates

286
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,360
is something like o Tilda of n^ s and

287
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,920
here I'm using o Tilda to hide constant

288
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,640
and poly logarithmic factors um just for

289
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,519
Simplicity

290
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,000
and again classically you might think of

291
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
n squ Gates as being really good but

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,640
given that we're having so much trouble

293
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
uh scaling up quantum computers it's

294
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,440
actually important to shave this down

295
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,480
even further uh the space on the other

296
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
hand is pretty good it's O and it's like

297
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,120
you know roughly the cost of just

298
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,000
writing down big end so you know maybe

299
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,480
that's not too

300
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
bad uh and then things remained quiet

301
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,519
for almost two decades um until uh lee

302
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,959
Pang duta came out with this result in

303
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,839
2012 that doesn't fact arbitrary

304
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,800
integers it targets integers of the form

305
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,399
p^2 q and the reason I want to make this

306
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,839
distinction is that if you could Factor

307
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,959
any input then you break RSA

308
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,360
cryptography and of course you can kind

309
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,600
of have the proofs of quantumness I

310
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,600
talked about earlier uh but on the other

311
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,200
hand if you can only Factor p s q uh

312
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,639
there's no longer any threat at all to

313
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,839
RSA cryptography from this algorithm

314
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,839
however it still works as a proof of

315
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,200
quantumness Alice can easily pick p and

316
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,000
Q on her side and then send p s q over

317
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,600
to the company um

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,160
so okay with that in mind what does the

319
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,519
efficiency look like so the space is the

320
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,959
same as Shore it's uh O then uh but the

321
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,920
gates they actually managed to bring

322
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:14,279
down all the way to OA event so near

323
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,320
linear so um really quite a lean

324
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,880
circuit um okay so then again things

325
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,800
remained quiet for over a decade or so

326
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,160
and then uh just two years ago OD dead

327
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,720
rev came out with this really nice um

328
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,720
factoring algorithm that once again is

329
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,079
in sh territory uh you can Factor any

330
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,079
integer

331
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,519
and uh the good news is he manages to

332
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,120
shave the number of gates down from n^ s

333
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,880
to like n the 1.5 using some very cool

334
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,600
ideas um bad news is that the space uh

335
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,079
in his algorithm also gets blown up

336
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,320
rather than n it's n to the 1.5 and

337
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,839
again classically you might not care um

338
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,360
quantumly this is kind of the end of the

339
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,519
world um because of all the scalability

340
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,760
issues we

341
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:58,600
have okay so uh my first result on

342
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,639
Quantum factoring with my advisor vinard

343
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,200
um is basically fixing this problem we

344
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,760
show how to uh reimplement regab

345
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,480
circuits so that the gate complexity

346
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,120
stays the same but the space goes down

347
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,839
to O til event so you can really think

348
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,880
of this as like a Best of Both Worlds

349
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,600
result uh between reg and Shaw's

350
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,279
algorithm uh so that's one result and

351
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,079
then the second result which I'm really

352
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,760
excited about and I'm going to tell you

353
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,440
more about shortly is with Vino then two

354
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,360
more collaborators here Greg Kahana

355
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,480
mokua and Katherine vankirk and here

356
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,600
we're once again in the lpds land where

357
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,639
um we're factoring integers of the form

358
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,959
p^ s q and additionally uh we're going

359
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,720
to leverage a setup where like Q is much

360
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,800
much less than P um and here the number

361
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,920
of gates is O Tila of n so it matches

362
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,519
the lpds circuit but the space we

363
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,480
actually managed to push down below

364
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,839
linear to something like n the

365
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,040
2/3 um so I think this was a surprise to

366
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,040
us and I think the reason why um I would

367
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,440
find a result like this counterintuitive

368
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,160
is that really saying that uh you don't

369
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,800
even need to ask your quantum computer

370
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,800
to write down n and yet it you can

371
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,480
somehow use it to factor n um so we'll

372
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,680
I'll kind of get into a very bird's eye

373
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,040
view of how we managed to do this um but

374
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,720
that's kind of the

375
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,800
history okay so uh what next um for

376
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,600
factoring so I would kind of view the

377
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,760
NSTAR as being to uh factor a large

378
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,240
integer on a real quantum computer so

379
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,839
algorithmically what we need to do to

380
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,320
get there I think oh yep you say Q is p

381
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,920
q is n 2/3 bits yeah I'll I'll explain

382
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,160
that later write down q but not n yes

383
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,639
yeah exactly yeah that's right um yeah

384
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,600
so it's O of log Q bits um to be precise

385
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,320
um okay good uh so algorithmically I

386
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
think it's really a matter of nailing

387
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,480
down and optimizing the concrete costs

388
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,600
of these algorithms so on my on my

389
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,079
results slide I was hiding constant

390
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,399
factors I was hiding poly log factors uh

391
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,480
on top of that like there are lower

392
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,240
order terms being hidden like all of

393
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,920
that matters a lot in terms of kind of

394
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,720
which circuits are going to be

395
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,360
instantiable in practice so I think um

396
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,360
that's kind of the most important thing

397
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,839
algorithmically once we get to that

398
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,399
point where we're satisfied with kind of

399
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,440
the concrete size of these circuits I

400
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,440
think it really has to be an

401
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,360
interdisciplinary effort with kind of

402
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,160
the hardware people and the QC people

403
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,480
because there are these three different

404
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,959
problems but I don't think they're

405
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,120
completely independent they kind of

406
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,160
intersect each other in wonderful or

407
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
Annoying Ways depending on who you are

408
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,519
um but I think you know once we get to

409
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,600
that point I think it will really take a

410
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,160
team effort to um get all the way to

411
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,759
actually factoring

412
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,480
something okay um so before I move on to

413
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,880
the next part of my talk I'm going to do

414
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,680
a non-interactive Q&A and people are

415
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,720
welcome to interrupt and make it

416
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,079
interactive um so the first question is

417
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,480
uh why factoring so some of you might

418
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,360
know that there's this other problem

419
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,759
called the elliptic curve discreet log

420
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,680
problem um that is classically much

421
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,600
harder than factoring and Shaw's

422
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,320
algorith solves that equally well um so

423
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
why not use that there's a bigger gap

424
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,079
between the quantum and classical

425
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,160
difficulty of the problem why not go

426
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,240
with that and I'll offer two answers so

427
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,399
the first one uh is related to something

428
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,920
that shr said in his talk this morning

429
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,920
that elliptic curve arithmetic is kind

430
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,759
of a pain it's very complicated and we

431
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,360
think that in practice it's too way too

432
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,600
much to ask about quantum computers at

433
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,560
least to begin

434
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,040
with and the second reason is that I

435
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
think a conceptual one which is that

436
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,160
factoring seems to admit a richer

437
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,680
variety of quantum algorithms so I think

438
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,519
it's just a more ripe problem for study

439
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,160
so you know of the five algorithms I

440
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,880
listed on uh a couple of slides ago it's

441
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,759
only the first one Shaw's algorithm that

442
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,519
has anything to say about ecdlp the

443
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,680
other four are only for

444
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,759
factoring problem for integers for

445
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,560
example for uh D helmet mhm uh great

446
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:54,839
question um so discrete log problem um

447
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,240
modulo and integer um is so reg's

448
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,959
algorithm also covers that um reg's

449
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,920
algorithm and uh my efficient variant of

450
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,639
it with v those also cover discret log

451
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,279
these pqu Q results don't have anything

452
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,279
to say about discret log but all of the

453
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:11,120
factoring ones um extend equally well to

454
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:14,399
disc log um good

455
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:20,279
question um okay

456
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:24,160
yeah uh what is the space complexity of

457
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:27,120
tic uh uh it's still the astics are

458
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,800
actually the same as Shaw's algorithm um

459
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,440
but the concrete costs are a bit of a

460
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,800
mess like there's a lot kind of each

461
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,399
operation you're doing like several

462
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,880
multiplications and additions but ASM

463
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,120
totically it's the

464
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,199
same uh good more

465
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,880
questions okay in that case let me ask

466
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,279
my second question which is okay if

467
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,040
we're having so much trouble scaling

468
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,440
quantum computers are we really going to

469
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,639
see them on the scale that we need to

470
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,759
factor large integers and uh speculation

471
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:00,319
of this form is probably above my pay

472
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:03,600
grade but it's not above vods so

473
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:07,319
uh Yep this is vard's 2040 challenge uh

474
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,839
so $240 says we can Factor 2040 bit Ines

475
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,679
by 2040 uh these are vard's words not

476
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,520
mine if you're interested in taking uh

477
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,199
him up on this beted uh see him after

478
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:21,079
after my talk during the coffee break um

479
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,959
okay cool um so with that let me move to

480
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,559
the second part of my talk which is on

481
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,520
this recent result with Greg Vin and

482
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,960
Katherine and this is on proofs of

483
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
quantumness from factoring peace squ q

484
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,600
and let me before I get started on any

485
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,360
details let me Circle back to the thing

486
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,240
I said earlier uh this question of kind

487
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,240
of what types of integers are easier to

488
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,559
factor and this part of the talk is kind

489
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,240
of answering that question so uh it

490
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,400
turns out somehow that integers of the

491
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,280
form p s q are especially easy to factor

492
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,000
uh compared to normal integers in ways

493
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,320
that uh we don't even see classically

494
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,080
which I think is interesting um and in

495
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,000
addition kind of Al new result is that

496
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,480
if Q is really small we can actually

497
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,600
leverage that structure as well um but

498
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,679
we'll see all of that that's just kind

499
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,919
of something to keep in the back of your

500
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:09,080
mind okay so this these two slides are

501
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,400
all I want you to know about Quantum

502
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,360
algorithms for the rest of this talk um

503
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,799
so the so the main thing that kind of

504
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,960
the main kind of quantum algorithm that

505
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,360
we need is a thing called period finding

506
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,880
so the setup here is that you have

507
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,320
Oracle access to a strictly periodic

508
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,080
function with some unknown period T and

509
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,600
by strictly periodic what I mean is that

510
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,679
uh f ofx is going to be equal to of Y if

511
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,799
and only if X and Y differ by a multiple

512
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,080
of T so you're not allowed any other

513
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,679
collisions and then the informal theorem

514
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,559
statement is that you can quantumly

515
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,520
recover t uh using essentially only the

516
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,760
G the resources that you need to compute

517
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,080
F ofx when X is like poly t uh that's

518
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,640
kind of the content of the theorem and

519
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
I'll just mention that this is also the

520
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,640
centerpiece of Shaw's Quantum factoring

521
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,880
algorithm uh for completely different

522
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,880
reasons that I don't have time to get

523
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
into but this is kind of what's going on

524
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,400
uh in his algorithm as well

525
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,640
okay uh but it turns out that we need a

526
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,159
slightly different version of this

527
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,720
theorem uh which I'm going to call

528
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,919
General Quantum period finding and this

529
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
is due to an observation by main sleeper

530
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,240
a couple of years ago and here the game

531
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,039
changes and instead of a strictly

532
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,559
periodic function it's just a periodic

533
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:20,480
function so if X and Y differ by a

534
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,400
multiple of T they still evaluate to the

535
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,559
same thing but I can have other

536
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,600
collisions so in this diagram I've

537
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,000
actually gone all the way I've taken the

538
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,039
same diagram but I've actually had bed

539
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,039
every value to Z or one so uh it's a

540
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,799
completely black and white periodic

541
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,440
signal and now what I'm saying is that

542
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,039
uh quantumly we can still recover the

543
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,919
period T um um most of the time there's

544
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,600
some technical caveats there and in fact

545
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,600
it's actually exactly the same algorithm

546
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,159
just like a more careful analysis um so

547
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,679
this is kind of the variant that we will

548
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,120
need all right so that's it on Quantum

549
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,559
algorithms um I also do need to set up

550
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,880
some number Theory preliminaries though

551
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:02,600
um so let me introduce an object called

552
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,320
the Leandra symbol so we say that an

553
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,679
integer a is um a quadratic residue

554
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,320
moduo a prime P if it's congruent to

555
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,960
some Square moduo P or in other words uh

556
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,960
you know you can add some multiple of P

557
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,559
to it to get a square that's kind of the

558
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,159
gist um and then the Leandra symbol is

559
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,440
basically just some way of kind of

560
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,080
indicating whether this is the case so

561
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,200
we're going to say it's one if it's a

562
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
non-zero quadratic residue we're going

563
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,000
to say it's minus one if it's not a

564
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,640
quadratic residue and this there's this

565
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,400
corner case where if a is divisible by P

566
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,400
uh we're going to say it's zero but most

567
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,000
of the time you should think of the

568
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,520
Leandra symbol as being plus or minus

569
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,760
one the zero is just kind of a weird

570
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,640
Corner

571
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,159
case Okay so that's the Leandra

572
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,400
symbol and now uh let me move to a

573
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,720
generalization of this called the jacobe

574
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,080
symbol which is basically where the

575
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,840
second input rather than being Prime is

576
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,400
now allowed to be a composite odd

577
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,159
modulus and the way this is defined is

578
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,480
that uh you know given as input um an

579
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,960
integer n with its prime factorization

580
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,559
like so you define the jacobe symbol of

581
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,120
a with respect to n by taking its jacobe

582
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:09,240
symbol basically you take the

583
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,960
factorization of n but everywhere you

584
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,600
see a prime you replace that Prime with

585
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,279
the jacobe symbol of a with respect to

586
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,799
that Prime so that gives you this

587
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,120
expression and uh let me make a quick

588
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,000
note for intuition that the quadratic

589
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,880
residue characterization I made on the

590
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,720
last slide um for the Leandra symbol

591
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,039
actually does not carry over here um

592
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,559
this is just kind of some other object

593
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,240
um and the reason that's the case is

594
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,480
that once n is composite it's possible

595
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
for the jacobe symbol to be one um

596
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,559
without a being a quadratic residue mod

597
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,720
n um that's just a comment for

598
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,640
intuition okay uh but as far as

599
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,240
algorithms go I'm only going to need two

600
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,279
properties of the jacobe symbol so the

601
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,120
first one is that it's periodic um with

602
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,360
like it only really cares about what a

603
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,720
is modul n and maybe this shouldn't

604
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,720
surprise you given how um I defined it

605
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,679
earlier but basically what it means is

606
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,320
that if a is congruent to B modul n then

607
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,720
A and B should have the same jacobe

608
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,200
symbol with respect to

609
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,080
n and the second property I'm going to

610
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,720
use um is this very cool fact that we

611
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,360
can actually compute the jacobe symbol

612
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,120
in NE linear time and um this is not

613
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,400
obvious from what I've told you in

614
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,480
particular if you were to try and

615
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,159
compute it by factoring n and then like

616
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,799
using that expression well then I've

617
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,159
asked you to factor n and like we don't

618
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,960
know how to do that in polinomial time

619
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,480
um but it turns out there's some

620
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
completely different way of doing it um

621
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,600
there's some completely different uh

622
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,120
classical way of doing it um that lets

623
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,039
you kind of carry out this computation

624
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,120
much faster um but I don't have time to

625
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,240
get into that we're just going to use

626
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,480
this black box okay um so with that I

627
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,880
can now introduce the lpds circuit from

628
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,320
2012 which is what we build on and here

629
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,520
I'm going to tell you how to quantumly

630
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,360
factor p² q and the starting point is a

631
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,919
very simple observation which is

632
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,559
basically saying let's look at the

633
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,400
jacobe symbol of a with respect to n

634
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:03,200
given that n is p Q I can write it like

635
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,279
so where the jacobe symbol as you know a

636
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,080
mod p^ 2 * a mod q and as I said earlier

637
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,520
almost all of the time a mod P is going

638
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,080
to be plus or minus one so when you

639
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,640
square it it's going to be one and that

640
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,720
disappears and you just get the jacobe

641
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,080
symbol of a with respect to q and now um

642
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,559
from the periodicity property I

643
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,320
mentioned of the jacobe symbol this

644
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,039
thing is periodic with period Q so if we

645
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,360
could find this period then we have q

646
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,720
and then of course we have P that's and

647
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,600
that's game over and uh that's exactly

648
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,559
what we have a quantum computer to do we

649
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,360
run Quantum period finding and then we

650
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:39,240
recover q and hence

651
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,039
P um okay good and the gate complexity

652
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,640
of this as I mentioned earlier is

653
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,720
something like the cost of computing

654
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,640
this jacobe symbol when a is at most

655
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
poly Q um so this is something like uh

656
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,159
this is NE

657
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
linear and if you implement this kind of

658
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,440
in the natural way uh the space is also

659
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,120
going to be NE linear um okay so this is

660
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,039
the lpds circuit um before I get to our

661
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,400
results I'll quickly check for questions

662
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,400
since I introduced a lot of

663
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,640
stuff

664
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,200
okay

665
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,279
um so we have classical algorithms for

666
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,880
factoring p² q that use completely

667
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:22,960
different techniques um uh but I think

668
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,520
here we get we get special savings like

669
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,799
we don't have a Classical period finding

670
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,440
algorithm that's kind of the story so

671
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,640
this specific setup is only something

672
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,399
can do

673
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,399
quantumly uh good more

674
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:42,039
questions okay then I will move along um

675
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,720
okay and now onto our results so what we

676
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,000
basically do is that we manage to push

677
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,159
the space down to uh essentially o of

678
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,760
log Q rather than log n and the center

679
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:52,480
the kind of central ingredient of our

680
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,840
result is a new way to compute the

681
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,120
jacobe symbol of a with respect to n and

682
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,919
we're going to exploit two observations

683
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,480
so the first one is that a has to be

684
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,960
poly of Q it doesn't have to be as big

685
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,120
as n so log a is something like o of log

686
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,600
q and this could potentially be much

687
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,360
less than o of log n so this is

688
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,440
something one could hope to

689
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,480
exploit and the second thing is that n

690
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,840
is actually classically known and so

691
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,880
what this means is that you can kind of

692
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,440
quantumly stream through the bits of n

693
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,840
um to save space um and this might sound

694
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,159
a little high in the sky so let me

695
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,120
provide a picture to kind of explain

696
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,520
what's going on so the object on the

697
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,240
right is our quantum computer so this is

698
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,039
super space constrained um it only has

699
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,080
like o of log QQ bits nowhere near

700
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,960
enough to hold n but sitting in the

701
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,360
middle is a classical computer that's

702
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,919
controlling the quantum computer it's

703
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,200
sending instructions telling the quantum

704
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:42,520
computer what operations to carry out

705
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,799
and what you should imagine is that the

706
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,399
classical computer kind of has access to

707
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,159
all of n so looks at the bits of N and

708
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:51,520
chunks it into chunks of size o of log q

709
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,960
and what it's going to do is it's going

710
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,240
to take these chunks one at a time and

711
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,600
forward them along to the quantum

712
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,080
computer so the quantum computer at any

713
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,520
point in time is only holding one of

714
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,320
these chunks which is why it only needs

715
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:07,240
log Q um bits of memory but it actually

716
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,039
reads through all of then over time um

717
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,399
and uh I'm not telling you anything

718
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,919
about how a setup like this could

719
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,520
actually be used to compute the jacobe

720
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,480
symbol that takes quite a bit of work

721
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,080
but this is kind of how it's even

722
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,600
possible um okay um okay so that's the

723
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,440
deal um the resulting circuit we kind of

724
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,679
match the lpds result where the number

725
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,360
of gates is O total of log n uh but now

726
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,600
the space is shaved down to O total of

727
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,919
log

728
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,120
Q so now there's a question of how one

729
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,840
should set parameters so if you make q2o

730
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,039
large uh you know the lpds circuit is

731
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,039
space log n our circuit is space log Q

732
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:43,320
if Q is too big then uh our circuit

733
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,679
doesn't have anything new to offer we

734
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,720
haven't made life any easier for the

735
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,440
quantum

736
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,600
computers um on the other hand if you

737
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,000
make q2o small you could imagine that

738
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,360
there are classical algorithms that

739
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,880
could somehow exploit this kind of added

740
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,840
structure to run faster than general

741
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,159
purpose classical factoring algorithms

742
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,480
and we don't don't want that because the

743
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,440
name of the game here is a Quantum

744
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,799
classical Gap if we make things easier

745
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,440
for the classical computer that's no

746
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,880
good either so it turns out that if you

747
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,760
kind of dig into kind of what we know

748
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,799
about classical factoring The Sweet Spot

749
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,080
is something like log Q being log n the

750
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,120
2/3 and that's how we get our proof of

751
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,799
quantumness uh where the number of gates

752
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,640
is near linear but the space is actually

753
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,520
sublinear it's um n the

754
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,600
2/3 okay so that is our result and now

755
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,559
let me just conclude with some uh more

756
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,320
open questions

757
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,720
um so one is you know are there other

758
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,360
Quantum factoring algorithms that

759
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,799
exploit special structure in N um as far

760
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,080
as I know I've literally told you about

761
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,159
everything we have um whereas in the

762
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,559
classical case we have a lot so I think

763
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,240
it's super interesting to kind of see

764
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,919
whether there are other ideas out there

765
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,480
um and secondly and you know importantly

766
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,240
in practice can these algorithms be

767
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,000
boosted using some weird number Theory

768
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,279
magic to factor um you know generic

769
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,640
integers n or at least RSA integers

770
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,200
right you know just a product of two

771
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,679
primes like can we somehow boost this to

772
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,320
factor those integers more efficiently

773
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,360
um the best thing we have to say to this

774
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,480
effect is um an observation in our paper

775
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,159
same paper with the four of us is that

776
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,960
uh you can actually use this p s q

777
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,799
business to completely Factor um any

778
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,720
integer where its prime decomposition

779
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,519
has distinct exponents um so you know if

780
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,000
I give you this N I can actually find

781
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,960
all the Primes and all the powers not

782
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,890
just like kind of one factor um uh yeah

783
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:37,360
and with that I'll stop thanks very very

784
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:40,600
[Applause]

785
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,480
much uh just quickly for the like into

786
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,000
the 2/3 is that just because like number

787
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,880
field zip is like into the 1/3 exactly

788
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,640
yeah and the best classical algorithm

789
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,120
that would exploit a small q runs in

790
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,720
like time like exponential in root log Q

791
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,519
so when you match those paramet is it's

792
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,519
yeah

793
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,519
yeah so what circuits themselves aren't

794
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,559
stateful right they always give the same

795
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,440
output for the same input right uh when

796
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,200
let me ask a real question when you're

797
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,360
sending the chunks in it doesn't

798
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,039
remember what chunks have already been

799
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,679
sent in right you're doing some

800
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:16,960
classical computation on the end to

801
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,480
reconstruct the factor yeah so your um

802
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
so the only thing that the quantum

803
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,640
computer needs to use the chunk to do is

804
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,039
to compute this jacobe symbol um so it's

805
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,360
going to use the chunk to compute the

806
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:26,640
jacobia symbol and then it turns out

807
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,880
that it can just forget about that chunk

808
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,120
and move on to the next chunk

809
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,480
classic the end that computes the final

810
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,200
factor from those symbols exactly like

811
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,200
um kind of as part of the quantum period

812
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,279
finding uh algorithm yeah that's

813
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,159
right please just to clarify like there

814
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:47,159
is State like Quantum State that's

815
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,360
maintained between each chunk so you do

816
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,760
have to do some classical posst

817
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,320
processing but there is like Quantum

818
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,240
State maintain so like you get a chunk

819
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,919
you do something and then p a Quantum

820
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,159
state that has to do with it and then

821
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,240
you get the next trunk what you do with

822
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,880
the next trunk has to do with the

823
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
existing Quantum state from the previous

824
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,399
J so it's not you can do these things

825
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,080
totally separately as like separate

826
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:06,720
Quantum ciruits or something okay does

827
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,480
it make sense yeah but that also brings

828
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,919
another problem which is that not not

829
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,120
only do you have a hard time having a

830
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,440
lot of cubits you also have a hard time

831
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,760
having to be stable over time right oh

832
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,000
good yeah you do need to maintain

833
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,960
coherence through these but the nice

834
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,720
thing is we actually show something that

835
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,240
se didn't didn't mention so far I mean

836
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,279
you can I don't have to answer this

837
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,960
question I don't know what you're about

838
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,480
to mention fair enough we also show that

839
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,320
you can do this in in quite low depth

840
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
uh so also suppling your death so it's

841
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,679
actually super good in terms of the CO

842
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,679
as

843
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,760
well take a break and take the rest of

844
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,760
the questions in the break thank you
