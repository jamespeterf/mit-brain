00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Morning

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,040
everyone. My name is Batis Puvier,

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,760
founder and CEO of Diplo AAI.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm here today to tell you about what we

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,519
do, which in a nutshell is to take a

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,440
product that you are building and to

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,160
identify and track every single

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,320
regulation, law, and standard that

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
applies to that product. So you can

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,039
imagine this is a task that takes hours,

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
weeks, months to do, and it's errorprone

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,000
and so forth. Um we're very very proud

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,039
across the last three years to be

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
supporting some of the largest

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,040
manufacturers in the world that trust us

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
to be embedded in their product

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,239
development process. You see some of

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,680
those that are listed uh on this slide

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
here. We have a few case studies towards

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,600
the end as well. In a nutshell, I'm sure

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,680
this is probably not a huge surprise,

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
but regulations are going out of

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,719
control. There are objectively more

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
regulations published every single day

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,039
across many more jurisdictions, a

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,879
fragmentation, lack of harmonization

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,800
across countries. And then of course you

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,520
have all the software horizontal

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,600
regulations things like PAS materials

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,600
data privacy AI cyber security recycling

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,439
EPR all those topics that are coming out

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
that honestly didn't exist before. So

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,400
what this does is it really slows down

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
development time and leads to risk for

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
business launch. Um, of course, what

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
happens is you have really, really bad

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,320
visibility in terms of what is tracking.

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,759
Potentially, you are operating in over a

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,119
hundred countries around the world and

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,640
you need to know for every single

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
country what are all the requirements

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,000
you have to follow. You want to know as

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,680
soon as they change so that if you're

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
building something which honestly may

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
take 5 years, let's say, you need to

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
know as soon as something changes so

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
that you don't come to launch realize

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,200
you're not compliant in China for

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,680
example, then not able to launch as

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
well. Now, in a nutshell, the system

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,079
does three things. Uh the first part is

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,399
tracking, right? So pretty simply, the

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,399
system will look at every single update

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,920
that happens around the world. So to

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,479
give you a sense of scale, there are

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,439
4,000 regulatory and legal updates every

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,880
day just in the United States alone at

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
the federal and state level. And that's

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,119
really any regulation, any law, any

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,719
meeting, any press release, any speech,

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,119
any hint of a regulation that might come

62
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,640
up. The fact is for any of you, you

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,400
know, out of those 4,000, probably 99.9%

64
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
don't apply to you.

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,440
But the fact is 0.01% do. And the

66
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,040
question is how do you get the guarantee

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,040
that you are finding every single

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,640
requirement for your product without

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
having to look at those thousands that

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
apply. And so the tracking says we're

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,239
going to look at maybe like 20,000

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
updates around the entire world find the

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
10 things that apply to the company. And

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,080
that's where the second part comes in.

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
So then engineers and R&D folks are

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
using the platform to say great we found

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,160
these 10 things that potentially affect

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,599
our product today. The real question is

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,680
what do you do as a result? What is the

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,280
impact? Is it a design change, which is

81
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
maybe the worst case? Is it a compliance

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
change? Is it a reporting change? What

83
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
do you have to do? Again, we may we may

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,440
have found these 10 things for you,

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
which is great, but each of those 10

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,599
things could be 200 pages long. And

87
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,840
again, this is where engineering and and

88
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,959
and R&D teams are reading one by one to

89
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
figure out the requirements. So really,

90
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,159
this is where that, you know, AI can

91
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,400
support and jump in for you. And

92
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,879
finally, the distribute is about getting

93
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,560
that information out to the engineering

94
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,680
and R&D teams, right? Imagine you've

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
you've tracked something, you found some

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
change that's really critical to some

97
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
system that you're building. You've done

98
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,159
the analysis, you know what to do. Now

99
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
that the most important thing arguably

100
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,840
is to get the word out and tell people

101
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,519
about it and and give the engineers the

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
tools to understand exactly what they

103
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,400
have to follow, what are the nuances,

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,319
what are the gray areas, etc. Um, give

105
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,239
you a bit of a case study. We are uh

106
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,360
live uh with one of the largest OEMs

107
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,280
around the world, you know, more than

108
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
100 billions in revenue and they trust

109
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,879
us to work with them from the initial

110
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,400
product development phase all the way

111
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,840
through to launch. Um the way that they

112
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
evaluate it, which is honestly the way

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,879
that happens most times, is you do a bit

114
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
of an AB test. And from their

115
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,560
perspective, the first thing that

116
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,799
mattered was efficiency. So how long do

117
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
they spend today manually going to

118
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
websites finding those thousands and

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,760
thousands every single day across many

120
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,439
teams decentralized around the world and

121
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,959
finding all the government updates every

122
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,519
single day. So they reporting spending

123
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,640
around 480 minutes or hours and hours

124
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
essentially every single day and with

125
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,720
the system they find 10 minutes uh to

126
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
look at those relevant alerts. At the

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,280
end day this is not that surprising

128
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
humans are not built to look at

129
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
thousands and thousands of things as

130
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,760
this is where AI can jump in as well. So

131
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,280
obviously a huge huge time saving which

132
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,639
is where a lot of the business case was

133
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,120
built but arguably more important is

134
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,759
what are the net new requirements that

135
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,199
they found that they would not have

136
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
found otherwise. So this was a

137
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
three-month P side by side. They had

138
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,880
their regulatory teams by the way there

139
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
are around 50 people that are doing this

140
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,840
full-time finding everything across all

141
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,919
the countries and yet around 30% of what

142
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
the system recommended they had reported

143
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,040
to have not found and were critical. Of

144
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
course these are not your standard

145
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,160
regulations. These are all the newer

146
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,919
ones around data privacy, AI, especially

147
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,479
in different parts of the world and and

148
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,520
globally too. And so, as you can see,

149
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,720
there's lots and lots of different ones.

150
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
The key ones that I've talked about are

151
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
around robust tracking, what does it

152
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,520
mean for you to not miss a single

153
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,759
requirement, the efficiency you can have

154
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,639
and minimizing all those redevelopments

155
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,840
as well. So, very happy we have a booth

156
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,199
in the other room. Very happy to talk

157
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,440
again, and thank you all very much for

158
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,440
your time.
