00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,440
I'm Cara Miller. And I'm Rob Stoner. And

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,839
from the MIT Energy Initiative, this is

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,150
What If It Works, a podcast looking at

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,599
the energy solutions for climate

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:17,680
[Music]

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,600
change. Today, we talked to a serial

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,199
entrepreneur who insists sustainable

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,039
alternatives do not have to be that

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,960
complicated. A lot of people expect

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
technology to be very fancy and

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,520
therefore very expensive. And so when

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
you see simple

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,040
solutions, people often overlook them.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,760
That's Ariel first, a professor of

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,960
chemical engineering at MIT. She's the

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,640
co-founder of multiple startups. And so

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
that's one of the challenges that we

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,680
faced in our research is people say,

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,399
well, it's so easy. Is it really this

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
technological advance? And we say it is

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,840
because it's accomplishing what we want

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,800
to accomplish just without hundreds of

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,079
millions of dollars of infrastructure

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,320
required. In a minute, we're going to

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,119
talk about athletic wear, believe it or

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
not. But before we do, the key to lots

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,840
of first environmentally minded

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,640
breakthroughs is something pretty small.

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,159
Actually, it's very, very small. My

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
research has always been at the

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,119
intersection of engineering and biology.

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,240
And I think people often underestimate

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,640
what biology can do. So my lab looks a

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
lot at the natural environment and the

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,240
microbes that are there. And they can do

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
pretty much any chemical process that we

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,079
want to do and that chemical engineers

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
have been working for hundreds of years

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,360
to try to accomplish, but they can do it

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,119
more efficiently and in a living

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
organism that can also stay alive while

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,079
it's doing that. So if we look to those

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,439
systems that have this uh head start on

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,159
us through evolution, then we can come

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,520
up with simpler solutions. Which brings

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,840
us to athleisure and a conversation that

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,040
first had with one of her undergraduate

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,079
students. One of them was telling me

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
about waste in the US and the average

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,640
person in the US throws out about 80

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,800
pounds of clothes a year and almost all

52
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,879
of that is polyester. So, we got to

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,200
thinking, well, is there a way for us to

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,560
help with this problem? There are places

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
in the world now, especially in the

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
global south, where you can't even see

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,440
the ground because there's so much

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,440
textile waste. But the waste is not

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,160
coming from the global south. It's

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,120
coming from the global north from places

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,480
like the US. And when you donate your

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
clothes or when you recycle your

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,200
clothes, that's where they often end up.

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,000
And so then they're either burned, which

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,040
is releasing toxins into the air that

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,319
these people breathe, or they're left to

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,160
degrade slowly on land. And again, this

68
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,599
ties back into our goal of equity,

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,480
right? It's really inequitable for

70
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,200
people in the global north to be heavy

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
consumers of these products and then

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,120
ship them off when they're done to be

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
someone else's problem. And many of

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,680
those clothes are made out of

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,040
plasticbased fabrics like polyester,

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,159
like spandex. So if you break them down,

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
you encounter a new set of problems. So

78
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,200
one of the challenges we see with a lot

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,720
of plastic recycling is that when we do

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
it with current methods, we end up with

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,200
microlastics. And these generally end up

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,920
in the ocean or in drinking water or in

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,519
food systems. And the health effects of

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,000
them aren't totally known, but they're

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,239
probably not great. So, our goal was to

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,879
figure out how we can take these

87
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,879
polyesters, these things that they make

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,560
most of the fast fashion clothes out of,

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,120
and turn them back into things that

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,080
companies would want to use. Then we can

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,319
basically circularize the fast fashion

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
economy. So, you're not generating more

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,560
of these starting materials that

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
generally come from fossil fuels, and

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,080
you're instead recycling it from these

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,599
clothes. and Ariel first and her

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,360
students figured out a way to do it.

98
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:07,360
How? So, this was actually inspired by a

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,680
technology that we had in the lab and we

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,400
were thinking about ways we could better

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,120
use it, which is um basically our

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,120
ability to just decorate microbes with

103
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,479
these proteins that can do whatever we

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
want them to. So, we pick the right

105
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,600
protein and it can do whatever task we

106
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,520
tell it to. And the great thing is we

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,199
can basically freeze dry these microbes.

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,880
So we can turn them into astronaut ice

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
cream if you've had that or if you've

110
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,800
seen the freeze-dried fruit. It's not

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,639
that good, but but it works really well

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
for killing the microbes but keeping

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,400
these proteins active. So we end up with

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,840
this really light powder that is very

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,280
very active and that means we can make

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,280
kg of this stuff for dollars and so it

117
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,840
really decreases the cost of protein

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,800
materials which has been one of the

119
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,960
challenges in bioengineering. And so we

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
were you know thinking about what we

121
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
think these would be great for. And the

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,560
great thing is even synthetic clothes

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,039
have a lot of chemical bonds that look

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,720
like chemical bonds in our bodies. And

125
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,479
what that means is that there are

126
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,080
proteins out there that can chew up

127
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,000
those bonds and split them. And so we

128
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
went searching for some proteins that

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,280
can do that. We found some and we were

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,280
able to kind of decorate cells with

131
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,840
them. And we found that they can chew up

132
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,600
polyester, the synthetic material, very,

133
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,600
very quickly. So this is what I like

134
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
about your style. Again, you're not

135
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
solving the naive problem that would

136
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,320
come to mind at first. Eat this stuff,

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,320
make it go away. It's turn it into

138
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,080
something we can use and recycle it and

139
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
create a loop. And that's sort of the

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
definition of sustainability, I think.

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,199
But again, this is not coming from me.

142
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,360
This is coming from the high schoolers

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,199
and undergrads that we work with who say

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,000
things like, well, most people when they

145
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
do plastic recycling, if they're doing

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
it kind of to the end product, it ends

147
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
up as CO2. So, how are you really

148
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
solving a sustainability problem if

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,320
you're generating CO2? And so, we were

150
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,440
thinking about how we can kind of bypass

151
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,960
that step. It's really hard to change

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,840
people's behavior, right? So, instead of

153
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,360
asking people to potentially not shop at

154
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,880
their favorite stores, we're making

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,960
decisions that would allow them to do

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,840
things in a circular way. You know,

157
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,919
there's a lot of industries that are not

158
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,080
going to be able to be decarbonized,

159
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,680
especially in the near term. So, what

160
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,840
can we do to stop generating more CO2

161
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
and maybe take some of those emissions

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,440
and use them to generate starting

163
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,919
materials again to circularize these

164
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
economies? Okay. So, when you have that

165
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
shirt that like nobody wants anymore and

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
it's made of polyester and then you

167
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
unleash the microbes and they eat it and

168
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,560
you like hold up this test tube and

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
there's like a little liquid in it,

170
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
right? And it's like this is all that's

171
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
left of the shirt. What is that? What is

172
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,720
in that test tube? So, that is what's

173
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,360
called monomer. So that's the small

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,039
chemicals that they make these polymers

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
out of, which is just a fancy word for

176
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,759
the things they make the thread that

177
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,120
makes polyester out of. So they're just

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,479
the polyester starting

179
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,240
materials. So the great thing is,

180
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,639
especially for polyester specifically,

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,520
is those molecules look like things that

182
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,919
microbes in soil eat. So in addition to

183
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,720
being able to use these for chemical

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,280
recycling, you could also just use them

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,240
as kind of feed stock for microbial

186
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,080
processes. So, where's the catch? How

187
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
come we're not using this? Or maybe we

188
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,639
are. So, the catch right now is most of

189
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
our clothes are not just polyester. So,

190
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,599
what we're working on now is making more

191
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,759
of these astronaut ice cream materials

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,160
that have different proteins on them so

193
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
that you can throw in a mix of things to

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
degrade whatever mixture of waste you

195
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,680
have. Again, I see. So, you don't have

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,319
to sort the clothes, which would be an

197
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
expense. Exactly. You get smart. So what

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,880
is in clothes that microbes that you

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,800
don't yet have the microbes to eat? So

200
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,360
things like nylon is a pretty prevalent

201
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,599
one especially in athleisure or elastin

202
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,840
which is what's in all the stretchy

203
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,080
athleisure material. When you look at

204
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,919
them often they have mesh panels or

205
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,560
things like that that are different

206
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,879
materials and so you have to be able to

207
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
chew up all of it. I guess there's sort

208
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
of two things you could do. one is like

209
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,000
the whole cycle as you say you could

210
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
degrade a shirt and then you could have

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,199
maybe the building blocks to make a new

212
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
one so you don't have to use petroleum

213
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,800
as you said to like do it again but it

214
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,599
also seems like even if you can't sell a

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,560
company on like let's go full cycle like

216
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,440
let's do this you can at least say this

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,159
is better than throwing it in the trash

218
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,919
can than chopping it up into little bits

219
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,320
as you say in like microplastics and

220
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,479
they're wherever at least to totally

221
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
degrade it and then throw So that what

222
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,919
was in the test tube away is far better,

223
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,480
right, than what we're doing now. Yes,

224
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,240
definitely. And one of the things that

225
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
is really fantastic about this is you

226
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,720
don't need any chemicals to do this

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,040
degradation. So in addition to thinking

228
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,640
about chemical engineering scaled

229
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,720
processes where you would have this in a

230
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,560
large reactor or whatever, can we use

231
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,200
things like at home composters where you

232
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,519
would throw in our microbes and some

233
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,000
water with your clothes because that's

234
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,760
all we need to do this degradation. So,

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
if you can do that, then you could do it

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,040
at home. You wouldn't have to ship your

237
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
clothes off to be recycled. But what

238
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,720
happens when you get these bugs out out

239
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,320
all over the place in everybody's homes?

240
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
The bugs get out and they eat my

241
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,920
clothes. So, the the great thing is

242
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,200
these bugs are dead, so we're not

243
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,279
worried about them kind of being an

244
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,120
invasive species, which is a valid

245
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,519
consideration when you think about

246
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
engineered microbes. But because we

247
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,560
killed them, turn them into astronaut

248
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,240
ice cream, that's not an issue. And so

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,000
we've engineered them to basically turn

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,160
on at high temperatures. So at

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,800
temperatures that most people aren't

252
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,480
wearing clothes, you know, we're talking

253
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,000
almost boiling water. So unless you're

254
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
wearing your clothes in the deep sea

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,560
vent. Exactly. So then we can kind of

256
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,080
control when these microbes turn on. So

257
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,000
how do you how do you engineer something

258
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,200
to be that tough? Lots of talented

259
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
students. Well, as you know, I'm a total

260
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,160
 when it comes to DNA. From our

261
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
past conversations, I've pointed out to

262
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,720
you that the DNA you've used in some of

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,079
your approaches is too fragile to be

264
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,760
used in the way you're planning to use

265
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,399
it, but you've pointed out to me that

266
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,880
it's not.

267
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,880
People underestimate DNA, I think. And,

268
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,279
you know, with a lot of the current

269
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,640
tools we can use for engineering

270
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,720
microbes, we can tune them with very

271
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
high precision. And for these proteins,

272
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,399
we can tune very specific pieces of the

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,160
protein as well as kind of the whole

274
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,480
microbe itself. So how many of these

275
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,800
proteins we're putting on the surface,

276
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
how stable they are is impacted by that.

277
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,560
Kind of how they're connected to the

278
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,720
microbe itself. And that impacts how hot

279
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,880
we can turn up the sauna on them

280
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,040
basically. So So give us an example if

281
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,040
you can of of how you've how you've done

282
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,519
this. What sorts of applications does

283
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,600
this find its way into? Yeah. So, we

284
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,560
think a lot about circularizing

285
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,360
economies and one of the main ways we

286
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,440
look at that is with critical materials.

287
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,920
So, um there's lots of things that we're

288
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,880
now realizing we need a lot more of to

289
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,399
make things like solar panels and

290
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,560
batteries. Um even batteries both for

291
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,079
your car and for your cell phone and

292
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,240
your smartwatch. And we're not very good

293
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,760
at recycling those battery materials

294
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
right now, but we're going to have to

295
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,640
start if we want to use batteries more.

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,959
And so we've also been able, just like

297
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,000
we can put proteins on microbes that

298
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,320
chew stuff up, we can put proteins that

299
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,240
specifically grab stuff from pretty

300
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,720
complex mixtures. So say you have a ball

301
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,000
pit, you only want the yellow balls. We

302
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,600
can put a protein on there that only

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,920
grabs the yellow ones and leaves all the

304
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,560
other colors. And so that's basically

305
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,720
what we do with these metals that are

306
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,160
these crit critical materials. That

307
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
sounds like it's mimicking the

308
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,360
biological use of DNA to to gather

309
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,120
together strands of proteins. Yeah. So

310
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
these are basically the DNA we're using

311
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,360
to tell the microbe what to do. So here

312
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,720
we're using DNA to basically program.

313
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,040
And then in some of our other work, we

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,160
do use DNA more as a material, but here

315
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,399
we're using that to tell the microbes to

316
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,839
make proteins that we then use as kind

317
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,680
of like the claw toy. is the idea there

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,079
that you're recycling a battery. It's

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,160
got a mixture of metals in it and you're

320
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,680
trying to say, well, this is this metal

321
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,240
and you're trying to sort them so that

322
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,920
you can then like take that pure thing

323
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,560
and say, okay, well, what are we going

324
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,360
to use pure lithium or whatever for

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
again instead of being it being a jumble

326
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,040
of other things. Yes. Exactly. And right

327
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,959
now the way people do that, people have

328
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,480
come up with very sophisticated chemical

329
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,360
tools to do that, but they're often very

330
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,440
energy intensive. And this is another

331
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,000
example of where evolution, you know,

332
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,760
these proteins come from these microbes

333
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,760
needing one specific metal and not

334
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
wanting anything else. And so they need

335
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,440
to be able to grab that one metal and

336
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,839
nothing else. And so if we take those

337
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,320
proteins and use them, we can get that

338
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,160
same specificity that it's nearly

339
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,000
impossible to get right now chemically.

340
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,720
When I think about clothes companies and

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,320
and the sort of appeal that they make to

342
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,720
people and the environmental impact that

343
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
they would like to have, like I would

344
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
think that if they knew anything about

345
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,959
what you're doing, which they might not,

346
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
but you could get companies to make,

347
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,360
let's say, simpler leggings that didn't

348
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,839
have mesh panels and saying like, if you

349
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
buy this legging, you don't have to

350
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,279
there other we make the ones with the

351
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,839
mesh panels or we do this or that, but

352
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,440
if you buy the like plain black

353
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,240
polyester something something because

354
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,760
it's simpler. Look at the awesomeness

355
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
that we can do with this. And people

356
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,800
might be like, well, they're like all

357
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,800
about the same price. I'll do the thing

358
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,440
that seems green. Yeah. I mean, that's

359
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,959
the goal. And at least in Europe, that's

360
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
going to be the direction everything's

361
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,560
heading. So, there are some mandates in

362
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
the EU that are going to make all

363
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,160
clothing have to be made of a single

364
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,120
material. Basically, they're doing it to

365
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,120
improve existing recycling processes so

366
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,560
that you can recycle more clothes. But

367
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,600
it would significantly help us kind of

368
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,120
if you could have single stream. Yeah.

369
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,839
Are they doing that specifically to

370
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,360
enable you? No. No, definitely not. That

371
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,800
would be fantastic. But um this is

372
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,120
existing recycling technologies

373
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,120
generally depend on very pure feed

374
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
stock. So very pure input. So you can't

375
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
have these mixed materials. You can't

376
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,160
have those leggings with that mesh

377
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,399
panel. So just to use current methods of

378
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,000
recycling, they're making this a mandate

379
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,720
that you have to use kind of single

380
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,240
types of fabric. Has anybody come to

381
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,519
you, a government or a company, and said

382
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,639
like this is yes, we'd like to do this.

383
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,399
Yes. So we've we've had some really

384
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,160
fantastic interactions with groups that

385
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,079
have made documentaries about textile

386
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,440
waste. They're very passionate about

387
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,120
solutions to that, right? They don't

388
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,959
want to just educate people on the

389
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,040
waste. They want to help solve that

390
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,079
problem. And so, uh, we're working with

391
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,560
them to get access to some of these

392
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,480
textile dumps in the global south. And

393
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,120
so that we can try once we have these

394
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,839
mixtures of microbes to degrade mixed

395
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,720
textiles and help clean up the

396
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,399
environment there without needing to

397
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,760
burn the clothes, which is what happens

398
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,959
now. How does that pay for itself? Does

399
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,720
the government have to provide the

400
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,279
funding to do it? Are you making a

401
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,440
useful product somehow? It honestly will

402
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
depend a lot on clothing/chemical

403
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,920
companies because if they start to see

404
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,000
value in these starting materials that

405
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,839
aren't from fossil fuel feed stocks. So

406
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,760
they may be a little pricier but they're

407
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,040
not going to be orders of magnitude

408
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,120
pricier. They're not going to be 100

409
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,360
times pricier. Then they can purchase

410
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,120
these and it would be useful for them

411
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,380
because then they and create a loop.

412
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,919
Exactly.

413
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,919
[Music]

414
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,560
As I mentioned at the beginning of the

415
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,839
show, Ariel First is not just an

416
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,120
entrepreneur. She's a serial

417
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:03,199
entrepreneur, and her efforts to create

418
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,920
a greener world extend to another

419
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:09,120
company of hers, Helix Carbon, which

420
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,440
also taps into her love of biology.

421
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,639
Helix Carbon is inspired by the DNA

422
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,040
Helix. Um, we talked a little bit about

423
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,759
how DNA is the genetic code, right? can

424
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,720
help cells program making proteins. But

425
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,160
DNA is this three-dimensional material

426
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,440
that has really cool properties beyond

427
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,079
just the letters of the bases. DNA has

428
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,800
two strands that unite in a specific

429
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,040
way. First says, and the two strands are

430
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,240
brought together by hydrogen bonds,

431
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,800
which are not particularly strong, and

432
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,279
that works almost like Velcro or like a

433
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,440
zipper coming together. these two things

434
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,199
that are floating separately, they come

435
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,639
together very tightly, but it's also

436
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:56,240
reversible. And so this allows us to use

437
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,480
DNA to regenerate things. What FIRST is

438
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,079
looking to do with this DNA is to help

439
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,000
facilities that generate a lot of carbon

440
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:07,199
dioxide use it in a way that's helpful

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,559
to them. And that means turning it into

442
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,799
all sorts of useful products, plastics,

443
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,880
paint, liquid aviation fuel, and these

444
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,959
are things that people call tough to

445
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,959
decarbonize industries because, you

446
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
know, it's going to be really hard to

447
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,959
make a plane fly on solar power alone

448
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,360
right now. So, these are things that are

449
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,079
going to take longer to fully reach an

450
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,720
energy transition. And so, until then,

451
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,039
we can at least make their process net

452
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,919
zero, right? because we're pulling CO2

453
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,400
out to be the start of that process. So,

454
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,120
how do you use the CO2 that facilities

455
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,160
emit in a more effective way than it is

456
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,720
currently being used? FIRS says what

457
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,720
Helix carbon does is it makes synthesis

458
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,919
gas, also known as sin gas. It's a

459
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,120
mixture of carbon monoxide and

460
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,440
hydrogen. Right now, it costs about $700

461
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,640
a ton if you get it from fossil fuels.

462
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,799
costs about $1,200 a ton minimum to get

463
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,960
it from electrochemical processes. So

464
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,280
people don't want to use it because it's

465
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,799
not sustainable or profitable for their

466
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,200
company, right? Don't want don't want to

467
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,240
use the electrical process. Yeah.

468
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,480
So, we have been able to basically stick

469
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
our catalysts onto one strand of DNA,

470
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,160
stick the other strand of DNA on a

471
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,320
carbon electrode, which decreases the

472
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,600
cost of our system, and that decreases

473
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,360
the amount of energy we need by about

474
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,520
30%. And it brings the overall cost per

475
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,120
ton of sin gas to about $350. So, it's

476
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,120
win-win because it will actually

477
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,960
incentivize companies to capture their

478
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,440
CO2 and convert it into something they

479
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,640
can actually use. I guess sin gas is the

480
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,640
main input to fiser tropes process for

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,840
for making hydrocarbons. Yes. So okay.

482
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,880
So this is a gas that's already being

483
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,480
used and the fisher tropes process that

484
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,039
would be used to make things that like

485
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,200
could power a big ship to go across the

486
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,880
ocean or something, right? So it's

487
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,280
there's already a need. So what you're

488
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,720
trying to do is just say like don't use

489
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,320
this, use this other way of making it.

490
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
It's better for the environment and

491
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,480
you're trying to make it cheaper. Yes.

492
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,559
And it can all be done on site. So now a

493
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,160
company would install our system. It

494
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
would capture CO2 that they're already

495
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,600
emitting and turn it into sin gas right

496
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,840
there in a shipping container sized

497
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,880
unit. Sin gas prices are pretty strongly

498
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,799
tied to natural gas prices. And so as

499
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,799
those

500
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,280
fluctuate, so does company costs. And so

501
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,840
now they know exactly what their cost

502
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,760
will be long term for SN gas. So you can

503
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,760
participate in futures markets very

504
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,160
efficiently. I guess that's not that is

505
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,480
beyond my area of expertise, but people

506
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,679
can with this tech. And are there many

507
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,520
companies that are doing both things?

508
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
They're emitting CO2, so they'd be a

509
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,799
good candidate for capturing it and

510
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,600
wanting sin gas. Yes, most kind of

511
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,640
chemical plants right now use sas for at

512
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,559
least one of their processes. And so

513
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
most conventional chemical factories

514
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,240
could use this technology probably for

515
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,160
those and they're also big emitter big

516
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,160
emitters. So this just sounds to me like

517
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,679
an incredibly valuable company. You

518
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,520
you've got sounds like a lock to make

519
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,720
all of the sustainable air fuel, all of

520
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,760
the e diesel, all of the e gasoline, all

521
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,080
of the e every fuel. And from the way

522
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,840
you're describing it, companies that are

523
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,520
in these businesses should be tripping

524
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,360
over themselves to license your

525
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,200
technology. Is that happening? Yeah. Or

526
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,720
do they need to hear this podcast to

527
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,120
know? We already do have a lot of

528
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,480
interest from pretty large kind of

529
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,400
chemical companies and it's very

530
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,000
exciting because um we do see a lot of

531
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,080
external interest from people who are

532
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,840
just interested in sustainability. So we

533
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,679
won the climate and energy prize. It was

534
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,679
$100,000 in non-dilutive capital plus

535
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,840
what was very exciting is the $5,000

536
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,880
audience choice award. And so that was

537
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,360
really gratifying for us to see that

538
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
this was impactful and meaningful to not

539
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,880
only the judges in the large

540
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,200
petrochemical companies, but also to the

541
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,760
general audience who were listening to

542
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,080
all the pitches. So without screwing up

543
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,120
your access to dilutive capital, the

544
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,360
kind of capital you're really going to

545
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,200
need to go big on this, where's the

546
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,880
catch? Actually, there there is no

547
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
catch. There's no catch. Well said.

548
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,480
That's that's my challenge. People ask

549
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,640
me that and I just uh the great thing

550
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,200
about the DNA we're using is it's

551
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,760
synthetic DNA so it's chemically made.

552
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,240
So it's not like we're taking DNA from

553
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,320
any sort of biological thing and it's

554
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,679
very inexpensive. It means we can use

555
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,760
significantly lower amounts of catalyst.

556
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,320
So the expensive metal parts of this and

557
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
we can use carbon electrodes that are

558
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,400
much more sustainable and less

559
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,799
expensive. So it really also decreases

560
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,880
the overall cost of these systems to

561
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,120
enable their broader use. So obviously

562
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,840
we're targeting these large prochemical

563
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,880
companies, but this could also be useful

564
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,280
for turning things like solar power into

565
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,440
chemical storage because if you can make

566
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,600
that solar energy go into one of these

567
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,760
systems to make things like ethylene,

568
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,640
you then have something that's

569
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,120
chemically stored energy. So, so what's

570
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
what's the advantage here for the

571
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,559
developing world where you have a lot of

572
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,039
interest? I mean, how do they benefit

573
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,679
from this uniquely or especially because

574
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,400
these systems are very inexpensive and

575
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,039
they can run off of systems that don't

576
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,880
require a power grid. You can set these

577
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,320
up pretty much wherever you want. What's

578
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,320
these? These is a electroly a sin gas

579
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,159
making machine or so s gas is our

580
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,440
initial target but we also have

581
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,240
catalysts that can make things like

582
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,320
ethylene and so that's good for chemical

583
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,880
energy storage cuz then you can use that

584
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,360
either for plastics or burn it directly

585
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,720
and so in a lot of places that don't

586
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,440
have grid connections so where solar or

587
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,080
battery storage is a challenge this

588
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,000
would allow them to basically capture

589
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,480
energy from clean systems and keep it in

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,559
chemical energy. So, so ethylene is a

591
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
fuel. Yes. Is it a useful fuel or can

592
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,200
you get to a useful fuel by the same

593
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,320
sort of logic? Yeah. So, we can take

594
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,799
that and make it into longer chains. So,

595
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,799
liquid fuels. Um, you can also use

596
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,679
ethylene directly and burn it. It's not

597
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,360
the most efficient but it is a source of

598
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,440
chemical energy. So, so you could

599
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,880
imagine one of your plants sitting in

600
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,880
some village in West Bengal. That is the

601
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,799
goal. powered by a solar panel. Cool. I

602
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,720
want in.

603
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,400
So, I mean, a lot of the stuff you're

604
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,919
doing that we've talked about, you're

605
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,799
kind of on this path to

606
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,960
commercialization when things come out

607
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,600
of the lab and then you're hoping like,

608
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,000
oh, you know, we can like change how we

609
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,159
deal with athleisure pants or whatever.

610
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,080
What are the biggest hurdles that you

611
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,080
hit? Is it like it's hard to get people

612
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
to invest? It's hard to get people to

613
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,840
understand the technology. I I don't

614
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,760
know, you know, what what's the hardest

615
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,400
thing about going on that path from like

616
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,840
the lab to the to the marketplace?

617
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Honestly, within the MIT ecosystem, it

618
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,840
really hasn't been difficult. Of all the

619
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,720
places I've been, MIT is really very

620
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,480
strong for that. So for Helix Carbon, I

621
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,480
was actually approached by two MBAs who

622
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,520
were interested in commercializing this.

623
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,480
they had heard about it in one of their

624
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,799
classes and their goal in coming to

625
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,919
Sloan for an MBA program was to find a

626
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,240
sustainable tech to commercialize and so

627
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,760
I feel like I get a lot of support in

628
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,559
the areas that I'm not as comfortable

629
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,440
with as uh kind of engineering faculty.

630
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,840
So they do the business plan, they do

631
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,799
all the customer discovery work, they

632
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,240
build their network, and they're even

633
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,240
the ones who are going to be doing the

634
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,720
actual fundraising. So pitching to VCs

635
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,279
and all of that and so having that as a

636
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,600
resource I think kind of circumvents a

637
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,679
lot of the main challenges with

638
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,279
technology commercialization.

639
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,960
You've been involved in a program that

640
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,760
was set up by our former former

641
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,600
president the the great uh Susan

642
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,000
Hawkfield who's a dear friend called

643
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,679
female faculty entrepreneurs FFE. Is

644
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,919
that right? Uh I think they've changed

645
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,760
the name now to faculty founders but yes

646
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,200
it's the same program. So how does that

647
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,480
work and is that is that what you're

648
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,880
talking about when you're when you're

649
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,279
talking about how easy it's been? Yes.

650
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,640
So that is a fantastic program that was

651
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,039
basically set up through the school of

652
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,679
engineering to train female faculty on

653
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,240
how to be entrepreneurs because female

654
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,039
faculty at MIT start companies at

655
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,960
onetenth the rate of male faculty. So

656
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,039
the thought is that that leaves a lot of

657
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,240
tech on the table that should be

658
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:45,440
commercialized. And um the thought

659
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,520
between Susan Hawkfield and Sangabia

660
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,520
um who was one of the other people

661
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,840
running the program was that a lot of

662
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,559
this is just because of lack of exposure

663
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,200
and so it was to kind of train us. We

664
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,840
got industry mentors. It helped build a

665
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,320
network of other faculty on campus that

666
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,400
are interested in commercialization and

667
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,840
it's been really useful. It also

668
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
connected me to a lot of the student

669
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,039
entrepreneurship programs which have

670
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,960
helped my students um think about their

671
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,120
technology and also to some of these MBA

672
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
students who have helped us

673
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,840
commercialize. And so the the bigger

674
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,320
question, what do you feel like are the

675
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,880
challenges ahead or like how hopeful do

676
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,760
you feel about the trajectory we're kind

677
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,240
of on in terms of energy usage?

678
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,799
Obviously, we're really trying hard to

679
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,799
keep the global temperature in check.

680
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:37,919
Honestly, I feel very positive about the

681
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,440
way sustainability technology is moving.

682
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,640
And a lot of that honestly is I've

683
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,919
mentioned this a couple times, but it's

684
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,159
the high schoolers and undergrads that

685
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,600
work in the lab. They are incredibly

686
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:51,039
determined and missiondriven to make the

687
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,840
world a healthy place for everyone. And

688
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,960
so they are the ones driving a lot of

689
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,039
our motivation and you know the actual

690
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,320
translation of this tech and making sure

691
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:06,039
what we can do is actually usable and

692
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,640
cost effective and transportable,

693
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:11,520
accessible. So I really have to give

694
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,520
credit to them for that.

695
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,480
You mentioned to me that you were

696
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,600
thinking about ways to destroy these

697
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,520
so-called forever chemicals, PAS and POS

698
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,720
and those sorts of things. Is that

699
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,279
really going to be practical, do you

700
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,080
think, using these techniques? It has to

701
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,760
be right. We we need methods to degrade

702
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,080
these chemicals that don't also impact

703
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,200
the environment. A lot of the chemical

704
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,320
strategies to degrade forever chemicals

705
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,760
involve more PAS involve more of these

706
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,520
chemicals because that's what captures

707
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,360
them best. And these are chemicals that

708
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,200
are unleashed by like have been in

709
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,240
plastic and they get unleashed. Yeah.

710
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,200
These are things like non-stick cookware

711
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,360
in the Northeast. They're also on a lot

712
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,840
of the military bases and a lot of the

713
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,480
firefighter training sites because

714
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,760
that's what's used in firefighting foam.

715
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,840
Also, dental floss, like what are they

716
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,480
thinking? Yeah.

717
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,559
Stuff you put in your mouth. Yeah. Yeah.

718
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Okay. And but this stuff hangs around in

719
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,480
water and in the ground and stuff. And

720
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,640
so you're trying to We're trying to

721
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,720
destroy it. Yeah. With microbes. Yep.

722
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Okay. This has become a major priority

723
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
for a lot of companies that produce

724
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,039
chemicals of various kinds because it's

725
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:27,360
it's just getting everywhere. So the

726
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,880
great thing about evolution is if you

727
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,600
look at a lot of these sites that have

728
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,600
very high levels of these chemicals,

729
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,440
there are microbes growing there. And

730
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,000
the way they're growing there is by

731
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,640
evolving to eat these compounds, these

732
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,159
chemicals. And so, you know, by pulling

733
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,960
out the proteins that are responsible

734
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,559
for that and kind of putting them on our

735
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,799
microbes, on our astronaut ice cream

736
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,200
microbes, we can at least start to

737
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,559
degrade these and make them either to

738
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
the point where they're no longer

739
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,320
potentially harmful for humans or

740
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,000
animals, uh, or just fully degraded.

741
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,679
That's amazing. It's like the upside of

742
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,679
the downside of like, you know, there's

743
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,640
these like the Pacific Garbage Patch and

744
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,240
all this stuff and you think, "Oh,

745
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,399
that's terrible." But then like I guess

746
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,960
somewhere there's like some little

747
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,960
organism that's like I could eat this.

748
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,559
This is pretty tasty. This is why I

749
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,240
think and I'm going to get a lot of

750
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,440
flack from my lab and my family for

751
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,320
saying this, but microbes are the

752
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,799
coolest because they have found microbes

753
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,720
that living in gold mines and abandoned

754
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,279
gold mines that have basically shifted

755
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,679
all of their metal usage to gold cuz

756
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,840
that was what was abundant. And you can

757
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,760
pretty much find that in any environment

758
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,919
that is non kind of native. The microbes

759
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,360
there have evolved to use what's around

760
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,760
them. Ariel first is a professor of

761
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,480
chemical engineering at MIT. She's also

762
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,679
the co-founder of two companies. Ariel,

763
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,120
thanks so much for being here. This was

764
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,159
great. Thank you so much. This was

765
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,159
really fun. Thanks, Ariel.

766
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,640
What if it works is a production of the

767
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,399
