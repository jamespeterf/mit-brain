1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:05,200
I'll be talking about

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:08,400
colocalization which is predominantly a

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,480
method used to find overlaps between

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,120
gwas and eqtls start off with something

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,639
that a lot of people are probably

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
familiar with but which is foundational

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,039
to the whole topic which is linkage

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
disequilibrium and that's basically the

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,720
fact that variants that are near one

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,960
another on a chromosome tend to be

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,000
inherited together uh and because they

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,519
tend to be inherited together if one of

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,320
the variants creates a change in some

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,440
kind of TR we're measuring like height

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,800
or cholesterol the other variants that

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,239
are inherited with it tend to also be

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,039
statistically associated with the trait

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,920
so when you have a gwos Locus it looks

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,640
something like this where there might

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,600
only be one variant in this Locus that

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,719
actually Alters the trait in humans but

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,640
you have many many variants that the

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,120
gwos identifies as statistically

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,760
associated with

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,640
it and this is a problem if we want to

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,719
compare two gws right here we have the

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,680
same

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,040
Locus and we're looking at two different

29
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,360
traits which I'll get into in a bit uh

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,880
and it might be the case that when you

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,320
have these two trades you have a variant

32
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,880
that's genomewide significant in both of

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,680
them it's statistically associated with

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,799
the trade on the left and the trade on

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,079
the right but that doesn't mean that

36
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,920
that variant or any variant is

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,320
necessarily causitive for the changes in

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,680
both traits in fact you could have

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,400
variants that are different from that

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,720
original variant in fact also different

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,399
from one another that are responsible

42
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,600
for the two traits and that could mean

43
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,000
something very different biologically

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,000
than if the same variant is causing

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,880
both or alternatively to have a

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,479
more oh well so yeah as I said a gene

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,640
that's significant for both traits is

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,960
not enough and to get around that we

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,520
have to look at the entire locus of the

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,200
association we have to look at the

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,799
entire Locus in a way that considers

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,640
linkage

53
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:03,360
disequilibrium uh and a positive example

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,840
uh would consider linkage in this kind

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,640
of way so here we have the most

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,720
significant variant for the trade on the

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,120
right and we can see that uh even though

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,519
this variant is technically significant

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,040
in this other trade notice that this uh

60
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,280
P value scale is very high uh it's

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
clearly not the most significant variant

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,040
and these variants that are in linkage

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,000
disequilibrium with the variant in the

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,800
trade on the right are not in linkage

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,160
disequilibrium

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,200
on the left and that's evidence that

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,120
even if you do have a shared significant

68
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,120
variant it's not a shared causitive

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,000
variant uh and in this uh alternative

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,200
example you have two very similar

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,920
looking

72
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,599
chws uh and in the locus on the right

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,440
the most significant variant is also

74
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,800
significant for the trade on the left

75
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,840
and even though it's not the most

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
significant variant in the trade on the

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,879
left the linkage pattern where we see

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,400
these variance in tight linkage with

79
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,440
this purple variant is pretty similar

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,080
and that's evidence that in this case

81
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,720
you do have shared significant variants

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,599
and that those shared significant

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,319
variants are likely due to a shared

84
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,080
positive variant and the reason we care

85
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,400
so much about this is that we often want

86
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,080
to compare gws and

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,319
eqtl and the reason for this is most gws

88
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,120
are

89
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,360
non-coding and because they fall in

90
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,319
non-coding regions the mechanism isn't

91
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,239
as immediately clear as if they fell in

92
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:45,519
the coding region of a protein one idea

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,519
is that they may often affect Gene

94
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,319
regulation and so the question we want

95
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,120
to ask is does this same variant that's

96
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,519
responsible for the gas trate also alter

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,959
the expression of a gene variants that

98
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,360
alter the expression of genes are called

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,239
eqtl or expression quantitative trait

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,480
Losi and mapping them works very very

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,319
similar to GW and so because of that we

102
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,680
can do use this method of comparing to

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,359
gws Losi to link eqtls and gws so here

104
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,359
actually the trait on the the left is

105
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,759
LDL

106
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,520
cholesterol and the trait on the right

107
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,600
is the expression of the

108
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,960
CP Gene which is known to be linked to

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,080
LDL cholesterol and so this VAR whatever

110
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,880
variant is altering the expression of

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,240
this Gene also seems to be altering the

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,800
expression of the level of cholesterol

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,000
in humans and that's not proof that

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
changing the expression of this Gene

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,400
changes the level of cholesterol but

116
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
it's pretty strong

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,080
evidence so I'm going to be talking

118
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,120
about two families of methods uh the

119
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,160
first method is transcripton wide

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,919
Association studies or

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,680
TS and there are quite a few pretty Sim

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,280
versions of this the second set of

123
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,880
methods are colocalization methods both

124
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,160
of these answer a pretty similar

125
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,880
question probably some very strict

126
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,280
people would say that TS aren't

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,440
colocalization methods uh but I'm going

128
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,080
to give some time to about and so PW

129
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,800
methods basically correlate gene

130
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,280
expression between a

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,639
gwas uh sorry

132
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,600
correlate the genetics of a g was and a

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,680
gene expression trait

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,919
so this would be pretty straightforward

135
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,560
if you just had gene expression measured

136
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,680
in the same individuals you had the GW

137
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,280
was tra and you wouldn't even need

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,600
genetics in fact you could just look at

139
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,759
whether the expression of this trait of

140
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,160
this Gene was correlated with the trait

141
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,400
but it's pretty rare that we have both

142
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,600
of these sets of data in the same

143
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,199
individuals so originally how TS worked

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
is they looked at the genetic

145
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
Association ations that affected

146
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,360
expression and then they looked at which

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,199
variants were present in the

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,199
individuals uh that the gws was run on

149
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,080
and you can impute to a certain level

150
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,639
you can infer what the likely level of

151
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,479
expression in these individuals is and

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,360
then with this estimated expression you

153
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:28,080
can compare that to the GW was

154
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:30,080
tray um so you start off with the the

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,240
Snips for expression

156
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,759
which you identify in some expression

157
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,039
data set such as gex then in other

158
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,039
individuals you use their genomes to

159
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,680
predict the expression and you can

160
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,919
compare that to the trait and then later

161
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,479
versions uh simplified this so that you

162
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,720
can actually do it just with summary

163
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,919
statistics you don't need the genomes of

164
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,000
the individuals in either case and at

165
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,680
this point it's essentially a genetic

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,160
correlation test but because it's a

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,240
genetic correlation test for uh

168
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,759
expression in some other trait it is

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,400
looking at that relationship between

170
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:11,440
gene expression and say LDL

171
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,879
cholesterol uh TOS is very powerful but

172
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,800
it's imprecise now I've only talked

173
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,360
about one method essentially but the

174
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,440
different methods of ts are very very

175
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,599
similar uh and it

176
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,360
works very well

177
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,360
when the positive variant is actually

178
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,840
missing from one of the data sets which

179
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,280
can be a huge problem for other methods

180
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,560
but because it's just relying on the

181
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,759
correlation TS isn't that thrown by

182
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,960
that uh however we also know that many

183
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,120
genes in a Locus have correlated

184
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,599
expression that uh genes tend to go up

185
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,159
or down together and in that case TS

186
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,360
can't really distinguish between them

187
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,879
and you often have multiple hits in a

188
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,680
Locus when you have these multiple hits

189
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,479
you know you end up with a lot of

190
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,520
positive findings so I think TS is very

191
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:10,360
good uh when you're you know doing some

192
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,440
sort of exploratory analysis but tends

193
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,080
not to have the specificity that you'd

194
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,000
want to really consider it confirmation

195
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,039
of some

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,639
idea so going to go on to colocalization

197
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,639
methods please do feel free to to

198
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,479
interrupt with questions I can still get

199
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,840
everyone to the next talk on

200
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,560
time uh cocalis ation

201
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,800
methods ask a slightly different

202
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,159
question if T asked are the genetics of

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,039
gene expression and the GW trait

204
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,120
correlated colocalization asks is there

205
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,440
a variant that is responsible for

206
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,560
altering gene expression and altering

207
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,320
the GW was trait so the statistical

208
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,800
methodology of all of these methods

209
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,240
looks something like this what is the

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,959
probability that a variant is

211
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,160
in in a Locus is causal for a change in

212
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,720
expression and also for a change in the

213
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,640
GW

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,959
trait and how can we measure that

215
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,839
conditional on the data we've observed

216
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:19,720
in our gws and our eqtl

217
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,160
mapping and essentially this is fine

218
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,320
mapping right because if there was no

219
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,519
linkage disequilibrium this would be an

220
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,480
easy question if there was only one

221
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,120
positive variant in a Locus

222
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,240
that would be the only variant you would

223
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,959
find because there tend to be these

224
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,040
correlated Association statistics we try

225
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,000
to narrow those down with fine mapping

226
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,760
and when we narrow those down

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,360
together uh you have this joint fine

228
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,240
mapping that is essentially what most

229
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,600
colocalization

230
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,160
is uh part of the reason colocalization

231
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,880
is powerful is because as a basian

232
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,600
method it kind of lets us flip this

233
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,160
question around so instead of asking

234
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,600
just what is the probability that this

235
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,640
variant is linked to expression and to

236
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,800
the gwos trait given the data we

237
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,600
observe we can ask

238
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,600
well what is the probability that these

239
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,320
data would occur

240
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,680
if we assumed that the variant is truly

241
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,800
an eqtl and truly a xwas

242
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,200
Association and then what we have over

243
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,279
here on the right is we have our our

244
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,000
prior because this is a basian method it

245
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,839
includes our estimation before looking

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,839
at any of the data that the gwas hit and

247
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,600
the eqtl are the same variant and the

248
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,480
prior is actually one of the areas in

249
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,079
which different calization methods tend

250
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,000
to

251
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:47,920
differ so one important way in which

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,399
colocalization methods can gain power is

253
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,440
by not just looking at individual

254
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,480
variants because sometimes you don't

255
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,600
care which variant is an eqtl and which

256
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,200
variant is responsible for the change in

257
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,440
the GW was trait you just care whether

258
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,480
it's the same variant and in those cases

259
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,760
you can do this joint fine mapping and

260
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,360
then you can actually sum it up over a

261
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,720
region so you can take the probability

262
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,680
that you know this first snip is

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,079
responsible for both the expression

264
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,680
change in the gws trait change combine

265
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,680
it with the probability that this next

266
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,120
snip is and this next snip and so on and

267
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,160
so

268
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,399
on uh so some important things to

269
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:34,399
remember about colocalization

270
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:38,680
again it's not actually testing

271
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,600
causality if we find a calized Locus we

272
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,639
tend to assume that the change in

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,279
expression is contributing to the change

274
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,720
in the GW trait but we don't know that

275
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,560
this is the case it could be that uh the

276
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,160
change in the gas trait actually somehow

277
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,040
leads to a change in the gene expression

278
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,720
or it could be and this is probably more

279
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,800
like likely that they both share some

280
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,240
third cause that the expression of some

281
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,480
other Gene affects the expression of

282
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,320
this Gene and also affects the gwas

283
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,199
trait and this was sort of like the the

284
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,639
challenge Tas faces where you have these

285
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,639
correlated expressions of genes in

286
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,880
nearby

287
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,519
Loi and should also remember that

288
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,680
because it's a basian a set of basian

289
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,639
methods the output of colocalization

290
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,320
analysis is typically a probability this

291
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,000
probability can have a lot of different

292
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,120
names posterior probability Regional

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,279
colocalization probability uh etc etc

294
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,560
but it all kind of means the same thing

295
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,680
it's the probability that after doing

296
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,959
this analysis in this Locus the same

297
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,160
variant is responsible for the changes

298
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,240
in expression in gwas trait so a

299
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,760
posterior probability of 0.9 in this

300
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:05,079
case would mean that we're 90% sure that

301
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,079
the same variant is responsible for both

302
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,760
changes this of course given our

303
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,560
assumptions given our methodology and

304
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,399
given the data that we've

305
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,279
observed so there are a lot of

306
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,560
colocalization

307
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,320
methods uh and in fact I haven't updated

308
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,480
this slide from previous times I've used

309
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,279
it so there's actually additional ones I

310
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:32,440
could have added since then uh some of

311
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:35,320
the most common ones are collo EAP and

312
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,639
inl which has since become fast

313
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,079
Ino uh so I'll talk a little bit about

314
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,399
the differences that tend to occur

315
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,360
between them because they they all have

316
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,040
that same basic premise at this point

317
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,959
which is jointly fine mapping expression

318
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,600
in the gws trait but one of the things

319
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:56,920
they differ in is how they handle alic

320
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,639
heterogeneity it's possible that the

321
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,240
association in a Locus isn't just due to

322
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,199
one variant that affects the GW trait or

323
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,880
one variant that affects the expression

324
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,360
of the gene there could be multiple

325
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,639
variant that are affecting the ex uh the

326
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,600
expression and in that case because

327
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,560
these variants are in linkage

328
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,000
disequilibrium you end up with a very

329
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,600
different set of summary

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,560
statistics and it becomes even harder if

331
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,120
you have say multiple variants that

332
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,040
affect a trait but only in but only one

333
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,639
variant that affects expression in the

334
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,560
locus then you'd still probably want to

335
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,440
return a positive colocalization result

336
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,639
because after all there is a shared

337
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,120
variant affecting both the gws trait and

338
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,759
the expression but it might be more

339
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,440
difficult to detect so some methods uh

340
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,199
are really designed around allowing alic

341
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,519
heterogen

342
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,720
heterogenity uh to

343
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,120
exist additionally because it's

344
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,560
essentially a fine mapping method there

345
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,120
are lots of different fine mapping

346
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,440
algorithms lots of different fine

347
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,880
mapping methods that you can use as the

348
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,480
basis for

349
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,720
colocalization and as other fine mapping

350
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,320
methods improve you tend to get improved

351
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,839
performance of

352
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,560
colocalization

353
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,360
additionally

354
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,920
uh pardon me these methods differ in

355
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,199
their prior probability so remember we

356
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,279
have that assumption up front of How

357
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,240
likely it is that the eqtl and the GW

358
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,720
are the same Sniff and there are

359
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,120
different things you could consider here

360
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,639
you could for example just say it's

361
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,079
totally random that there's some

362
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:41,759
probability that a snip is an eqtl some

363
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:44,199
probability that it's a Jos Associated

364
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,759
variant uh and those two probabilities

365
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,959
are entirely

366
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,959
independent you could also just have

367
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,920
something built in where you could say

368
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:56,920
well based on our understanding of the

369
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,560
biology of Gene regulation we think that

370
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,800
if a variant is an eqtl

371
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,720
it's you know say three times as likely

372
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,160
to also be a Goos

373
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,800
Association or you can look at the

374
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,360
summary statistics from the eqtl

375
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,560
analysis and from the gwas and try to

376
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,279
estimate the enrichment so you look at

377
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,600
how much overlap there is how large that

378
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,560
overlap is compared to what you'd expect

379
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:28,319
by chance and then you use that is your

380
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,920
prior in all the individual low sign and

381
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:33,000
uh addition Al and this is I think

382
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,319
perhaps the most important thing if you

383
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,759
just want to use results from cooll

384
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:40,319
localization there are very different

385
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,160
prior prob uh sorry posterior

386
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,000
probability cut

387
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,880
offs in frequenti statistics there's

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,120
kind of the accepted P less than 0.05

389
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,319
cut off which you know you'll have to

390
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,279
scale for multiple testing but which we'

391
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,839
have all sort of agreed on and I don't

392
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,560
think there's a threshold everyone's

393
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
really agreed on with B

394
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,120
statistics so depending on the method

395
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,520
and who's running the method I've seen

396
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,559
for these calization studies posterior

397
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,799
probability cut offs of 90% or greater

398
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:18,919
50% or greater 20% or greater 10% or

399
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,919
greater or even in one case 5% or

400
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,480
greater so that would mean that you

401
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:27,559
could have a Locus where you think that

402
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:31,120
there is only a 5% chance that the same

403
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,160
variant is responsible for both the eqtl

404
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,760
and the gwos association and you're

405
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,799
still returning as a hit so if you want

406
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,080
to use these data please please please

407
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:45,760
please check what the cut off

408
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,440
is generally what I use is fast inl uh

409
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,400
this isn't necessarily the best method

410
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,799
though it's the best for the things I

411
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,600
tend to be doing with colocalization it

412
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,840
allows a Le look heterogenity so it

413
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,400
still works pretty well if there's more

414
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,520
than one causitive variant in a Locus uh

415
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,919
additionally it estimates the prior

416
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,039
probability using the enrichment in the

417
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,480
data so it isn't just based on our

418
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,080
biological understanding it isn't just

419
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,159
assuming these things are independent

420
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,520
which we know is untrue it's looking at

421
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,960
the data across the entire genome

422
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,320
estimating How likely they are to

423
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,799
overlap and trying to use that in any

424
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,159
individual

425
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,440
Locus so how well does Co I have a quick

426
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,880
question oh absolutely um how we or do

427
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,360
we at all think about multiple testing I

428
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,840
know you talked about it with the

429
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,080
frequentist way but Invasion do we

430
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,520
adjust that pip threshold for when we

431
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,360
have more tests or how should we think

432
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,840
about that yeah you can't uh in basian

433
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,360
statistics you can't do uh just the same

434
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,480
sort of say Bon frony correction that

435
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,840
you can do with P values

436
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,440
uh it also just

437
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,600
depends how you want to use these data

438
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,840
if you want to test a specific Locus

439
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,120
right obviously you have to do don't

440
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,960
have to do any multiple testing

441
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,440
correction if you're looking across the

442
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,480
genome often in basing statistics we

443
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,799
don't have that kind of correction we

444
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,799
just have say the 90% cut

445
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,320
off um I have two questions the first

446
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,679
question is so it sounds like calization

447
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,640
is like stronger than T was or like more

448
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,919
strict is that right and then the second

449
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,000
question is what happens if you're

450
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,360
colocalizing a Locus that truthfully has

451
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,120
has multiple causal variants but you're

452
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,080
only using a single causal variant

453
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,320
assumption does that result in t result

454
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,559
in false positives false negatives or

455
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,640
hard to say yeah so to the first

456
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,360
question I think colocalization methods

457
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,440
tend to be more conservative than TS uh

458
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,679
as a result they also have weaker power

459
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,919
uh and I think this this weaker power is

460
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,760
also why the posterior probability

461
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,679
threshold often

462
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,360
gets lowered to pretty generous levels

463
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,320
and then as to the second question what

464
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,919
the effects of having multiple positive

465
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,840
variant while assuming that only one

466
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:14,120
exists generally this will lead to false

467
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,480
negatives uh if the two variants are say

468
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:21,640
roughly similar in their effects

469
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,760
then the fine mapping will just sort of

470
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,159
divide the effect up between them and if

471
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,039
say only one of those variants is

472
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,919
actually causitive for the expression of

473
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,919
the gene it'll try to put as much of

474
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,280
that fine mapping probability in that

475
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,799
one variant and will thus weaken the

476
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,120
amount of overlap you're

477
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:46,600
getting if you have uh the same two or

478
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,840
more positive variants that both affect

479
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:55,000
the gws trait and the eql trait I

480
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:59,440
think in in theory you should get better

481
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,080
per um better performance

482
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,120
then you would with partial overlap even

483
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,400
with these methods that assume one

484
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,400
causitive variant but in practice this

485
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,400
actually magnifies LD differences

486
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,320
between populations so you're still

487
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,480
going to take a hit to your power thank

488
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,080
you

489
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,440
welcome so we've been talking about

490
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,600
power which is perfect and how often you

491
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,840
find things because the answer to how

492
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:32,000
well colocalization works is not great

493
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,200
uh most methods have found somewhere in

494
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,440
the range of 20 to

495
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:44,919
35% of gwos lowai are explained by eqtls

496
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:48,200
so this means if say you have uh an LDL

497
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,960
gws and you think you have uh an

498
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,279
independent Locus in a region there's

499
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,520
maybe a quarter to a third chance that

500
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,360
when you look at this Locus you're going

501
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,840
to find an eqtl that seems to explain

502
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,480
it if it's not clear why this is this is

503
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,799
actually a something that people are

504
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,919
still arguing about a lot uh there's a

505
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,919
lot of possibilities and this is despite

506
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,039
the fact that as I've complained about

507
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,600
the posterior probability cutoffs are

508
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,240
often pretty

509
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,799
generous so you know as I said it's a

510
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,640
matter of debate people are arguing

511
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,279
about this a lot this is one of my

512
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,159
favorite paper titles of all time where

513
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,120
are the disease Associated

514
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,559
eqtls and a lot of the the possible

515
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,320
answers uh include just problems with

516
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,279
with power or it could be that there is

517
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,159
an eqtl that explains the Goos variant

518
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:39,039
and it's in a specific cell type or

519
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,799
there's a gene by environment

520
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,279
interaction that makes us struggle to

521
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,640
find it it could matter only early in

522
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,760
development there could be essentially

523
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,640
any

524
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,080
context that is required for the eqtl to

525
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:57,600
matter that we're not finding in our

526
00:22:52,080 --> 00:23:00,279
eqtl mapping studies and one uh very

527
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,960
very specific point that I want to make

528
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,840
is there's a commonly cited number

529
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,000
you've seen I've seen it cited over and

530
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,799
over and over again that

531
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,360
colocalization explains 43% of jws lowai

532
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,520
in fact it's probably the most common

533
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,600
number I see

534
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:19,400
cited and part of the reason I even

535
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,559
wanted to do a primer is just to specify

536
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,400
that this is a misreading of the paper

537
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,679
people get it from it is from the gex

538
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,679
paper which uses an unusual Co

539
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,240
localization method I don't think they

540
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:35,400
do it incorrectly but they divide the

541
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,600
genome into independent linkage blocks

542
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,640
and then look at whether there's any

543
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,080
overlap in the block an independent LD

544
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,880
block can of course have multiple gwas

545
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,360
Losi and if you have a highly polygenic

546
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,240
trait like say height you're actually

547
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,679
almost guaranteed to have multiple

548
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,559
independent associations in a gws Locus

549
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,600
so in that case When you're counting

550
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,679
whether that Locus is a hit or not you

551
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,480
have multiple probabilities for it to be

552
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:07,600
a hit and if you say have four Jos hits

553
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,840
in one of these blocks and one of them

554
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,480
colocalizes in this statistic that's

555
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,279
getting reported as one out of one

556
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,559
colocalizations again I don't think this

557
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,799
statistic is incorrect it's a

558
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,919
computationally simpler thing to do this

559
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,320
wasn't the main point of the gex

560
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,799
paper however when this number is cited

561
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,799
it's usually presented as the fraction

562
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,039
of gwas Losi that are explained and this

563
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,600
is actually giving a pretty artificially

564
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:41,399
High estimate of how well this method

565
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,840
works so I'm going to have a summary and

566
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:48,799
then talk a little bit about how to use

567
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,679
these methods so eqtls may explain the

568
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,720
mechanisms of non-coding Goos

569
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,399
associations there are statistical

570
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,720
methods that we used to see whether

571
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:02,279
eqtls explain these associ a and the two

572
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,240
big families of these are transcription

573
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:09,720
wide Association studies and calization

574
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,919
methods uh these methods often say more

575
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,039
about a region or a locust than they do

576
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,840
about individual variance because we

577
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,039
often care more about the locus than we

578
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,520
do about any of the individual variants

579
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,440
however most OS associations are not

580
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,039
explained by these methods yeah so uh I

581
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,279
had a question kind of related to uh I

582
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:34,760
guess when you run T and Colo with

583
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,919
exactly the same gws and eqtl data is

584
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,799
there are there cases where you may have

585
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,159
strong Tas signal but weak Colo signal

586
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,760
and vice versa and sort of do you have

587
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,000
any recommendations for how to reconcile

588
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,000
those differences I guess before you go

589
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,960
into the description of how each of

590
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,640
those kind of practically work yeah

591
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,799
that's a really good question if and in

592
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,640
fact if you run a colocalization method

593
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,640
and a TS method on the same data set you

594
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,679
will get uh very imperfect overlap and

595
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,200
in fact it's worse because if you then

596
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:07,640
run say another toos method and another

597
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,720
colocalization method on the exact same

598
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,039
data set the TS methods and the

599
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,840
colocalization methods will often not

600
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:19,080
even overlap that well uh and how I

601
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,000
would handle that again I think TS is is

602
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,799
good for for certain

603
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,559
exploratory

604
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,000
uh

605
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,720
examinations but it tends to to have a

606
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,120
lot of false positives and it tends to

607
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,760
report genes in sets because these genes

608
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,679
have correlated Expressions so if you

609
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,240
have a your Gene is a positive result in

610
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,080
t was you don't even necessarily know if

611
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,720
it's specifically that Gene or another

612
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Gene in Locus so if

613
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,640
there's uh imperfect

614
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,159
overlap I think in that case it depends

615
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,000
what you're planning to do with this if

616
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,760
you know you just want maybe a large set

617
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,919
of genes that you're going to be

618
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,480
testing uh then TS might be the way to

619
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,640
go if testing these is more difficult or

620
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,440
you want to make more specific claims

621
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,679
then TS is probably a little too broad

622
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,279
and you're probably going to want to use

623
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,080
a co-localization method you might even

624
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,480
want to use multiple co-localization

625
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,960
methods uh the results won't perfectly

626
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,440
overlap and in fact imperfect overlap in

627
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,240
that case is not proof that the result

628
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,799
is false um but typically I you you can

629
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,559
have more confidence that positive

630
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,840
result is a true positive using the

631
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,399
colocalization methods that makes sense

632
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,399
thank you you're

633
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,440
welcome um so I understand here we are

634
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
talking about Jas and eqtls but I just

635
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,600
wanted to extend the question to other

636
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,519
qtls right there are pqtls and other

637
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,720
qtls being developed and people start

638
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:53,360
using colocalizations for pqtl and Jas

639
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,279
colocalization um results so how do you

640
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,440
see that U because eqtls are way more

641
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,600
denser but pqts we have only few

642
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,799
proteins for which we have these qtl

643
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,880
mapped so how do we look into

644
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:09,000
colocalization methods when we have to

645
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,679
apply it to pqtl or other qtls and the

646
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,919
other question is how do we even think

647
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,440
about these priors when we look into

648
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,399
these other kind of

649
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,159
data this this is something I I really

650
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:20,840
like thinking about and something about

651
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:24,960
which I have a lot of opinions that I'll

652
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,840
try to keep relatively brief but yes

653
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,440
basically any association that kind of

654
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,120
has the form of a gws or eqtl mapping

655
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,080
you can use colocalization with we tend

656
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,000
to do it a lot with

657
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,840
eqtls because we have relatively

658
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,120
abundant eqtl data compared to a lot of

659
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,039
molecular other molecular qtls and we

660
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,720
tend to not only have relatively

661
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,559
abundant data but we have it across a

662
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,000
fairly large number of tissues Which is

663
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,960
less likely to be the case with things

664
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,120
like

665
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,039
pqtls but people have done Co

666
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,760
localization analyses using

667
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:08,640
pqtls uh and it's hard to

668
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,840
compare the power there because one they

669
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,000
tend to be done in blood which is also

670
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,519
the eqtl tissue where we tend to have

671
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,039
the highest power uh and it tends not to

672
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,799
be on the same scale but there are

673
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:25,080
definitely

674
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:28,919
pqtls that colocalize with gwas hits

675
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,799
that no eqtl colocalizes with

676
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:35,760
somewhat more surprisingly there are

677
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,720
gwas hits that colocalize with an eqtl

678
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,360
and there's no pqtl that I'm not sure if

679
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,880
that makes as much conceptual sense so

680
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,120
it might just be something like power uh

681
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,799
or the fact that you can actually have

682
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,960
eqtls that are shared across tissues

683
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,799
even if the

684
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,200
pqtl uh that's associated is not shared

685
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:59,120
and then again you can do it with pretty

686
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,720
much any molecular qtl uh there was a a

687
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,519
paper fairly recently that did them with

688
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,519
chromatin accessibility qtls and that

689
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,519
actually had much much higher power than

690
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,360
we've been seeing with

691
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,080
eqtls uh and I asked rayun who wrote

692
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,080
that paper why he thought that was and

693
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,919
he he

694
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,880
said it probably has to do with the fact

695
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,760
that it's easier to measure chromatin

696
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,440
accessibility qtls it's a bit more of a

697
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,480
a binary measurement as opposed to the

698
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,640
the Contin

699
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,120
distribution of gene expression and it's

700
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,760
a measurement that or an observation

701
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,240
that might be more consistent across

702
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,880
cell types tissue types Etc so even if

703
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,919
there is say a very cell type specific

704
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,919
eqtl we might be able to detect

705
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,080
something like chromatin accessibility

706
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,720
utl so there is a trade-off between a

707
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,519
few of these different things right

708
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,559
between how accessible and how

709
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:00,519
well-powered the data are uh between how

710
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:04,559
good we are at measuring the data and

711
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:07,519
also just how relevant the data

712
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,320
are you're

713
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,720
welcome I was curious have you looked at

714
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,200
how many of the

715
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,240
eqtls had localized what GW was because

716
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,399
you said the other way around like

717
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,399
there's 20% of all gwas Loa or a little

718
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,120
bit more than that that had a eqtl that

719
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,120
Co localized but have you look at the

720
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,480
other way around like have all the eql

721
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,440
signals being claimed by any

722
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,679
yeah I I don't have a number I think

723
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,919
generally it's it's lower um because you

724
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,559
know you can

725
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,559
imagine

726
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:44,880
that there are many traits for which the

727
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,919
expression of most genes doesn't matter

728
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,760
at all even if a large portion of say

729
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,240
height is explained by the expression of

730
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,120
genes it won't rely on the expression of

731
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,720
every chain uh so it's possible that if

732
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:04,159
we did really get a fully

733
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,720
comprehensive list of human gws traits

734
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,760
we'd start finding associations with the

735
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,480
expression of nearly every Gene but even

736
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:17,080
then we wouldn't find associations with

737
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:20,440
every eqtl because in fact we

738
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:24,480
have observed eqtls for almost every

739
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Gene in the gex project and so in most

740
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,960
of these situations where we have uh a

741
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,799
gws hit that we would expect to

742
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,600
colocalize with a nearby Gene say I've

743
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,720
been using LDL as an example a lot

744
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,559
there's a gws hit near ldlr the LDL

745
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:46,200
receptor Gene uh ldlr has an

746
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:50,279
eqtl you really might expect that that

747
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,080
eqtl explains the Goos association with

748
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:56,159
ldlr uh and it doesn't there might be

749
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,880
some ldlr eql that we haven't found yet

750
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,399
that does but that's specific eqtl seems

751
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,399
not to be

752
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,320
explanatory okay so I think I can get

753
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,799
through the rest of this and

754
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,399
probably under five minutes actually and

755
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,519
and then we can head over to the other

756
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:18,360
talk uh but these are just some

757
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,960
resources because in a lot of cases a

758
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,039
lot of these analyses have been run so

759
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,279
if you want to ask you know some

760
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:28,120
specific question you might have to do

761
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,080
it yourself but if you're just looking

762
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,159
for genes whose expression is associated

763
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,840
with the trait you're actually unlikely

764
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:40,039
to have to do the analysis yourself so a

765
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,279
large toos resource is toos Hub which

766
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:45,440
has uh hundreds of

767
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,399
traits and then models for the

768
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,159
expression of almost every Gene so you

769
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:52,039
can look for a trait or you can search

770
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,559
by a

771
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:58,279
gene uh and it'll tell you what the

772
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,320
associations are and you can see that

773
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:04,880
you know in for this significant LDL gas

774
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,599
Locus there are actually a lot of genes

775
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,119
that are reported together because uh

776
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,520
likely due to their correlated

777
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:16,839
expression it's difficult to distinguish

778
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,839
which gene or which genes is ultimately

779
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,919
responsible for

780
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,200
colocalization one of the most common

781
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,480
methods is Colo and it's also I think

782
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,639
one of the easier ones to use because

783
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,639
it's an r package so a lot of people are

784
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,520
already going to be comfortable with the

785
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:38,399
environment uh you can this is I I think

786
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,520
the the upto-date version some of these

787
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,040
methods have actually been converging a

788
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,879
bit and so now at this point collo and

789
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,079
fast and lo are very

790
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,359
similar but I have run this it is fairly

791
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,839
easy to run then fast and lo which is

792
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:57,920
what I tend to use is perhaps a little

793
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:00,640
trickier it's a command line tool but

794
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,720
one benefit is that they actually just

795
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,960
do have the eqtl side of it done if you

796
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,800
want to work with the gex data they've

797
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,599
already done the fine mapping uh and

798
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,599
that can go into estimating the

799
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,320
enrichment for the priors and that can

800
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,520
then go into the co- localization itself

801
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,280
true to the name it is pretty fast so

802
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,640
what you have to provide are just the F

803
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,240
mapped gws statistics and it's still

804
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:34,440
relatively straightforward to run there

805
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:38,200
also a variety of resources for

806
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,240
displaying potentially colocalizing

807
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Loi uh so this is Locust plot this is

808
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,839
one packaged uh our package that can be

809
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,640
used you can tell really in my earlier

810
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:53,640
plots I just took the right side of

811
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,760
these uh meanwhile the left side is also

812
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,240
uh basically showing a QQ plot for the P

813
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,280
values of both both lowai and you can

814
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:06,119
see in our our positive control Locus

815
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,040
that the P values tend to be relatively

816
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,440
correlated which is

817
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:16,400
encouraging and then uh there's also eqt

818
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:19,760
plot uh which I tend to really like it

819
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,079
has a lot of information conveyed on it

820
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,839
which can make it a little harder to

821
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:27,359
read quickly but it manages to show you

822
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:30,160
the effect sizes the associations of

823
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,680
both both traits all in one plot and

824
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,640
both of these are are pretty easy to use

825
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,839
they're both our packages as well so I'd

826
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,480
like to acknowledge my postdoc mentors

827
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,880
as well as Shamil SV in whose lab I I

828
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,079
learned most of the things I've talked

829
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:51,839
about today as well as the mpg primer

830
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,800
series that's it that was great um I'll

831
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,560
start us off with a anonymous question

832
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,839
online they say eqtl studies tend to

833
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,640
have much smaller samp sizes than gws

834
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,800
studies this may lead to poorly

835
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,920
estimated LD and not so great fine

836
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,119
mapping in the eqtl data even before

837
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,160
attempting the

838
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,319
colocalization so are there any good

839
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,200
ways to improve your power for example

840
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:16,480
with the reference population LD or a

841
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,680
minimum study size for the eqtl that you

842
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,560
would

843
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,920
recommend yeah and I think that's that's

844
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,240
getting it a what I think is a pretty

845
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,560
important point which is that I think

846
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,119
typically we're

847
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,560
the jwas Losi we're pretty confident in

848
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,520
because we don't have to worry about

849
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,480
context we don't wor have to worry about

850
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,079
developmental timing we just measure

851
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,359
something about an individual and look

852
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,800
at their genome uh I don't have a

853
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,960
specific cut off for the power of an

854
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,839
eqtl study one thing to consider is that

855
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,640
even

856
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,280
though uh eqtl studies tend to have much

857
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:58,160
lower sample sizes eqtls often have much

858
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,240
larger effect sizes than gws low

859
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,119
you can have an eqtl that's changing the

860
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,200
expression of a gene by double digit

861
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:09,640
percent which you're unlikely to find uh

862
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,160
for for an association in say an LDL gws

863
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,960
so it also does depend on what eqtls

864
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,800
you're looking at uh as for the the fine

865
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,880
mapping that can be tricky depending on

866
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,760
whether you're working with summary

867
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,520
statistics or the actual genomes you

868
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,599
might want you might be forced to use uh

869
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,359
a reference population

870
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,040
LD uh but if you have the genomes you're

871
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,240
probably going to want to use the ins

872
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,280
sample LD because even if it is a

873
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,800
smaller set it is the set of individuals

874
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,800
you're working

875
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,400
with I'm gonna keep asking questions um

876
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,000
to follow up on the population LD a lot

877
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,160
of these large GW Ed multi-population

878
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,880
meta analyses and a lot of eqtls include

879
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,160
samples from all different ancestries

880
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,960
and population

881
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,680
so if you're stuck with summary

882
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,640
statistics how do you accurate how do

883
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,720
you best find the best reference LD

884
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,720
panel and how important is

885
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,160
that yeah I'm not sure how you would

886
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,800
find the

887
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,079
best uh LD reference now most of these

888
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,040
methods have simulations on how much of

889
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:26,760
undetected structure you can have in

890
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,319
your gws or eql population and still

891
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:34,040
work and in fact there

892
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:35,920
are uh applications of these methods in

893
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,960
agriculture where we can actually see

894
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,680
that in the very stratified distribution

895
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,720
of

896
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,800
breeds uh you actually still have pretty

897
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,800
high power

898
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,839
so even though I tend to think that

899
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,680
perhaps the papers are really optimistic

900
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,000
about how well they can handle

901
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,839
population structure it's actually not

902
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,520
uh a lost

903
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:06,480
cause uh and if you can basically get a

904
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,960
reference that allows fine mapping to

905
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,040
work well enough then you should be

906
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,400
pretty well positioned to use

907
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,960
colocalization was when you say 20 to 35

908
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,400
are you talking about line

909
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,000
mapped hits or just all GW Losi uh just

910
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,040
trying to think through yeah it does

911
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,920
depend how you measure it it's generally

912
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,400
people people are trying to report

913
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,440
independent uh gws hits so you you can

914
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,040
try to detect the independence through

915
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,240
fine mapping it should separate into

916
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,160
different clusters you know in theory

917
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,440
you could also use some kind of stepwise

918
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,640
approach to counting the number of Loi

919
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,000
but given that you're fine mapping

920
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,800
anyway I think most people are just

921
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,400
reporting the the number of 95 or 90%

922
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,200
credible sets in F among those only 20

923
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,960
to

924
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,240
35% williz is there any other hypothesis

925
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:07,200
out there for what biological mechanism

926
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:11,200
could be going on that yeah ISL pqtl oh

927
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,599
um it isn't an eqtl or pqtl are we are

928
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,960
we just missing it is it like the

929
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,079
missing heritability thing I we're gonna

930
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,480
get there we're gonna find the eqtl if

931
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:22,720
you ask me uh I think we are just

932
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:28,720
missing the correct eqtls that they are

933
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:32,119
more specific than the you know adult

934
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,160
bulk tissue postmortem samples that

935
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:39,359
we're typically working with have been

936
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:42,560
able to reveal uh and that as we refine

937
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:45,800
methods as we look in more specific cell

938
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,760
types across development Etc we're going

939
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,240
to increase the number of

940
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,880
colocalizations in fact I think we're

941
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,720
already seeing that in a lot of cases

942
00:41:50,880 --> 00:42:00,079
it's largely a power game I guess could

943
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,720
you kind of refine your analysis say the

944
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,880
most you know with your Pips the highest

945
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,960
with the best eqtls we're you know we're

946
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,800
getting that number much higher like if

947
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:14,920
you stratify those gws hits you know

948
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,200
kind of according to levels of evidence

949
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,720
like you said in terms of we like these

950
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:23,640
eqtls it's a well-powered the right cell

951
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,680
type issue type and then we've got you

952
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,880
know strong fine mapping among that

953
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,680
subset that we're capturing most of it

954
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,839
among the rest is what I'm just trying

955
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,079
to kind of gauge the sense that you know

956
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,119
instead of a binary you know this is

957
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,880
what we're getting are we doing a lot

958
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:47,079
better at our most obvious or at least

959
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,359
well kind of characterized Lo yeah and

960
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:51,040
it's true typically you know the higher

961
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,119
end of these

962
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,880
estimates uh come from say blood eqtls

963
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,079
and relevant traits there just because

964
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:05,720
that's power is the highest um part of

965
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:08,839
the issue though seems to not simply be

966
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,720
that we're struggling to find map eqtls

967
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:14,000
or that we have the eqtls we're finding

968
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,240
have really weak

969
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,440
power it seems to be that we're finding

970
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,319
the wrong

971
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,480
eqtls

972
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:25,200
so it it may it's probably a power or a

973
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,119
context thing at least in my opinion but

974
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,640
it's a power or context thing that's

975
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,920
actually causing us to look in the wrong

976
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,200
place rather than just adding some noise

977
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,200
to the data
