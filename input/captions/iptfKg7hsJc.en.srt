1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,879
but now uh moving right along and I I

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,440
feel like this presentation is going to

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,240
bring us from kind of the beginning uh

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,840
where John was talking about the

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,120
workforce challenges that have bubbled

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,160
up from the past uh on to to Bruce and

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,880
Chris talking about the challenges of

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,359
the present and then uh FZ who's who's

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,640
working on such interesting uh problems

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,519
in in Ai and generative AI where I feel

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,800
like it's it's more futur looking and

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,080
and more perspective so um really

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,400
excited to hear your uh presentation Fez

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
and and look forward to what you have to

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,239
share

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,160
thanks for the invitation Ben um so hi

17
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,800
everyone I'm I'm I'll be talking about

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,719
AI for advanced design and first let's

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,399
start with what do we mean by Design

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,559
because design can mean a lot of

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,399
different things for different people

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,399
and when we focus on AI for design we

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,039
are mostly thinking about engineering

24
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,960
design where you are creating a plan for

25
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,000
either a product systems or Services

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,840
based on technical or functional

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,120
requirements this can mean you are

28
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:06,159
designing simple Parts simple assemblies

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,280
more complex assemblies or systems and

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,360
different networks now when we are

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,799
thinking about design like let's take

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,600
the case of the car design process and

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,720
if I talk to a car designer designer and

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,280
think about how they design products

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,960
there is the usual standard design

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,880
process where they would understand the

37
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,520
user Personnel they would do some

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,240
competitor analysis understand the

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,439
market basically identify the key design

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,920
parameters come up with some conceptual

41
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,600
sketches then do uh refined design make

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,520
a 3D CAD model send it to their

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,880
simulation friends and they might run

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,360
some cfd simulation they might send it

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,600
for a wind tanel test and so on and

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,479
there is research showing that 70% of

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,200
the life cycle costs of a product are

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,799
determined by the decisions that the

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,600
designers are taking in the early stage

50
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,920
of design so this is what we think the

51
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,000
design process is and what we read about

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,360
but in reality the process is much more

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,960
complex I mean in the car industry they

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,399
call it there is the devil cycle where

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,400
you go back and forth between the sketch

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,560
and the cad and the simulation and

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,599
entire process if we think about the car

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:23,319
design process it can take up to 5 years

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:26,239
uh going from a concept to a market so

60
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,640
this leads to insufficient exploration

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,680
there is difficulty meeting constraints

62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,599
there's also time in efficienc loss and

63
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,000
finally there's a lot of communication

64
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,120
burden but overall when we think about

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,200
it right like there is a challenge that

66
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,200
we see where people do not explore

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,879
enough because the cost of exploration

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,840
is very high and this is something which

69
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,040
we think a lot about and the key

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,879
motivation for us is how can AI enable

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,640
humans to create better designs faster

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,840
and and this is really uh critical for

73
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,280
many sectors we are talking about

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,080
whether we are it's Aerospace Automotive

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,760
energy shipping uh there's many sectors

76
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,519
where the design process applies to

77
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,440
different products now today's for talk

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,319
will focus a lot around generative AI

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,040
which has the potential to help with

80
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,720
some of this Mission let's start with

81
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,120
definitions like generative AI is a

82
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,760
field of AI that uses algorithms to

83
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,400
create new and original content such as

84
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,239
text image video and other media this

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,760
was written by a generative AI model

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,200
having said that most of us associate

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,239
generative AI with large language models

88
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,640
but generative AI is much broader than

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,000
that and it has been around for a while

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,120
from Models like mixtures of goian

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,159
variational autoencoders Gans diffusion

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,879
models topic models and so

93
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,480
on but at a fundamental level right when

94
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,799
you think about what generative AI is

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,799
doing this is a one-dimensional data and

96
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,200
you can see a histogram and effectively

97
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,120
a generative AI model is trying to fit a

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,239
curve to this distribution it's learning

99
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,400
the distrib ution that we want to

100
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,480
approximate now it's much easier to see

101
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,079
it in onedimensional data but imagine if

102
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,480
you have a single image that is thousand

103
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,319
by, pixels there is a million

104
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,439
distributions that you're running

105
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,840
simultaneously now what has changed like

106
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,919
why are we talking about it a lot a lot

107
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,360
now I think this is a good example of I

108
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,320
just in 2021 if I want to generate an

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,199
image of a group of elephants walking in

110
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,039
muddy water this is one of the best text

111
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,560
to image models 2022 2023 2024 and now

112
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:38,280
we are also seeing like models which can

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,960
generate entire videos based on text

114
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,759
problem so there is a lot of development

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,680
that has happened and disruption in

116
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,240
anything which is multimedia related but

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,560
the key thing we have been thought

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479
thinking about is what happens in

119
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,280
engineering how does this impact in

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,880
engineering and this is a really

121
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,600
important question because at a

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,440
fundamental level all these models are

123
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,680
doing are they are learning a very

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,639
complex data dri distribution and if

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,520
they can learn complex distribution from

126
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,960
text and image modalities can they

127
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,360
actually learn something about

128
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,360
engineering and we see that the

129
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,840
applications have been there across

130
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,759
different sectors from healthcare

131
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:22,240
industry financial retail and media

132
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,039
entertainment there is uh there is uh

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,360
claims that Char GPT and models like CH

134
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,280
GPT will change the word make jobs more

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
efficient however what we have found

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,520
from

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,160
Explorations and our thought processes

138
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,639
that the current AI models are not there

139
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,840
yet however there is a lot of promise

140
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,120
that we are seeing in the way design and

141
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,880
Manufacturing is done and I think we are

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,319
thinking a lot about at MIT on how can

143
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,400
we create the Next Generation AI model

144
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,319
that can enable us to reshape design and

145
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,800
Manufacturing so why are we talking

146
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,600
about next generation and I think the

147
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,039
key thing is where what are the

148
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
fundamental challenges with current

149
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,160
generative a model and a big thing which

150
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,160
I'll be talking about today is this idea

151
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,199
around Precision which is can we come up

152
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,880
with generative AI models that are

153
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,280
designed to produce highly accurate and

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
specific outputs that meet precise

155
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,800
requirements and this is really

156
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,800
important for engineering because uh we

157
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,759
have to come up with designs that work

158
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,240
and that function in the real

159
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,440
world there are other challenges also I

160
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,560
think in the interest of time I'll only

161
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,440
talk about a few challenges so let's

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,240
start with precision ative AI models and

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,759
in Precision generative AI models the

164
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,960
first problem I want to talk about is

165
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,720
this idea of structure design using

166
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,639
something called topology

167
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,680
optimization these days a few companies

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,240
are offering products around how to do

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
generative design or topology

170
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,720
optimization and the key idea there is

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
that you are given some domain and you

172
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,360
you are given some requirements in this

173
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,560
case you have some boundary conditions

174
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,759
like loads you want to use less material

175
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,919
so I want a structure which is stiff but

176
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,919
it's also using less material and there

177
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,319
are solvers like solid isotropic

178
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,599
material and with penalization method

179
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,479
that have existed for some time and I

180
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,800
think they are great for the tasks that

181
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,240
they do having said that they might get

182
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,199
stuck in local Optima and they may be

183
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,720
computationally expensive for expensive

184
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,680
for complex problems so what we think

185
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,039
about is can generative AI amortise the

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,800
cost of optimization so can we actually

187
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,720
come up with generative AI models that

188
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,800
can use experience to help these

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,560
optimization models do much

190
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,960
better so this is exactly how we think

191
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,960
about is like can we can we create a

192
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,960
data set of problems and once we train a

193
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
model given a new problem can it

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,879
instantly generate a lot of designs all

195
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,479
right so first let what have other

196
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,319
people done we look at some of the

197
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,440
existing methods and what we found is

198
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,080
that there is some promise in generative

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,120
AI models being able to generate

200
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,840
Solutions

201
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,639
so each row you have the ground truth

202
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,479
and then the top row is what generative

203
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,919
AI models come up with but having said

204
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,520
that we see that there's a lot of things

205
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,479
that cannot be manufactured there's

206
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,280
manufacturability defects and they're

207
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,199
not working as well as we would have

208
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,240
expected especially in conditions that

209
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,319
are out of

210
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,360
distribution the key reason here is that

211
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,960
almost all the generative AI models that

212
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,000
are uh imported from computer science

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,080
they are often focused on statistical

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
similarity which is they try to mimic

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,719
the data that they have seen But in

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,880
engineering it's really important that

217
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,519
you have to understand the performance

218
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,479
and the physics and that creates a big

219
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,760
issue because things that look similar

220
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,399
might all perform very differently so we

221
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,880
looked at we started looking at this

222
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,720
problem again the same idea with where

223
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,800
if you're using a model like di there

224
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,120
are diffusion models which are extremely

225
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,079
powerful generative models and we

226
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,120
started thinking about can these

227
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:03,160
generative models create 2D structures

228
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
and the first naive way of doing this

229
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,200
was like okay you can take a large

230
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,000
collection of designs that are optimal

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,920
and we can train a diffusion model to

232
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,760
solve this problem now this does not

233
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,000
work very well for the reasons that I

234
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,240
outlined so the next thing we started

235
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,160
thinking about is what how can we bake

236
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,040
in the engineering so we started looking

237
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,720
at what are our goals our goals were

238
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,480
things like compliance floating material

239
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,200
as a as a proxy for manufacturing and

240
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,560
once we can do that we came up with

241
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,800
methods that can incorporate this

242
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,440
regressor and the classifier performance

243
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,560
within the generative model using

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,560
something called guidance and the good

245
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,760
thing about guidance is that maybe you

246
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,880
train your diffusion model today 6

247
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,519
months down the line you change your go

248
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,600
goals you say now I don't care about

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
compliance I care about thermal

250
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,800
performance you can just change this

251
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,079
module and it's very modular so you can

252
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,760
get new new designs without retraining

253
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,920
from scratch so we do this and we saw

254
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
that already we got a lot of improvement

255
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,839
in compared to the previous generative

256
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,160
models so this is a huge Improvement

257
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,839
eight times less error in compliance 11

258
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,800
times more uh better manufacturable

259
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,839
designs as measured by floating material

260
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,079
but we were not satisfied this was like

261
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,600
looking very promising we couldn't see

262
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,120
that many cases it would actually come

263
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,240
up with new designs but we wanted it to

264
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,640
be actually even better we wanted it to

265
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,079
think on like how can we really bake in

266
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
the optimization ation performance and

267
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,160
what we started doing was we started

268
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,279
looking at this idea of learning not

269
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,760
only from the best designs but learning

270
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,440
from the trajectory of optimization that

271
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,440
has been obtained and this was critical

272
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,320
because the models can now learn from

273
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,360
nonoptimal designs and this is uh in the

274
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,240
newps paper we showed how you can take

275
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,079
this and bake it into the diffusion

276
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,839
model trajectory by saying the diffusion

277
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,600
model trajectory tries to mimic the

278
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,800
optimization trajectory and what we saw

279
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,440
this led to huge Improvement both in

280
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,760
terms of speed being faster and also

281
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Precision having said that and I think

282
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,440
one of the key things that we liked

283
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,800
about this was the diversity of designs

284
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,519
so in any given row you can see that for

285
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,279
the same problem it can almost instantly

286
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,160
generate many designs that are diverse

287
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
for the same problem so it was capturing

288
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,279
some notion of

289
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,720
multimodality having said that we wanted

290
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,800
to go 3D so we started looking at more

291
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,600
complex problems and also multi-domain

292
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,040
so now we are training not on a single

293
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,880
domain but multiple domains and came up

294
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,360
with these ideas around how can you

295
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,839
represent these problems in a in a

296
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,680
domain agnostic way so for that you have

297
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,800
to come up with simulation

298
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,079
representations that can be represented

299
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,160
as Point Cloud invariant Point clouds

300
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,320
and also the geometry as fields and by

301
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,200
doing that we found that this really

302
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,000
accelerated the process now we have

303
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,360
2,000 times faster than Sim which was

304
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,760
the previous Baseline and this speed up

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,480
which is 2,000 times comes up up at a

306
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,600
cost but that cost is only 32% accuracy

307
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,519
so given this now you can actually go

308
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,200
and do 3D almost instantaneous design

309
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,760
where you can change the loads and see

310
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,199
what the designs change and if you want

311
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,440
even better performance you can add it

312
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:19,880
to the optimization five steps or 10

313
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,040
steps and you can get even better

314
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,440
performance with 15 times faster so the

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,560
general key message is I think what we

316
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,079
have found is the generative

317
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,120
optimization architectures can really

318
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,040
help amortise the cost of optimization

319
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,560
so things we were already solving but

320
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,720
now we can solve it much faster and much

321
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,639
better and there is uh they are often

322
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,720
domain agnostics so we've talked about

323
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,720
topology optimization with DARPA we are

324
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,880
looking at multimaterial design we are

325
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,600
looking at car design the the same

326
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,920
Concepts can really apply across

327
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,279
different

328
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,839
domains and in the future we expect a

329
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,240
lot of foundation models to support

330
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,600
inverse design tasks now this has been

331
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
applied for aircraft design and ship

332
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,279
design where we have looked at different

333
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,680
types of challenges for each field like

334
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:13,959
data bias and lack of data and I think

335
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,279
the key idea is that u in general the

336
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,040
challenge is we don't have a lot of data

337
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,839
a lack of public data set so if you are

338
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,720
an organization thinking about

339
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,360
generative AI what you should really

340
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,160
think about is how can I invest in data

341
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,000
and create data sets that are useful and

342
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,839
and we have looked at it from many

343
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,120
perspectives we have created large data

344
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,519
sets and made them public I think there

345
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,079
is a lot of Promise around synthetic

346
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,160
data also we've looked at the idea of

347
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,560
negative data where you train the models

348
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,480
not just on good designs but also on bad

349
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,880
designs and finally transferring

350
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,920
Knowledge from other data domains so

351
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,320
this is just some examples of data sets

352
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,279
from cars and turbo Machinery to

353
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,199
topology optimization and ships that we

354
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,560
have created and again the the methods

355
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,000
can broadly apply to many other areas

356
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,639
that are of interest and we have looked

357
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,839
at many of them

358
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,920
ourselves with that I want to change

359
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,040
gears and talk more about design

360
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,959
co-pilots and in the first case we were

361
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,920
talking about accelerating optimization

362
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,959
now we want to talk about helping humans

363
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,199
like if this is problems where normally

364
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,120
people don't use AI at all for Designing

365
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,120
and we looked at the problem of bicycle

366
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,240
design we we teamed up with a company

367
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,480
called bik cat which where frame

368
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,040
Builders from across the world uh go and

369
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,560
create CAD models for bikes and we

370
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,519
started looking at how do you design

371
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,639
bikes for people and it's not just about

372
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,759
engineering performance the cfd or the

373
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,120
structural performance it's also about

374
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,600
things like the ergonomics or kind of

375
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,720
subjective performances like a user may

376
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,639
say I want a futuristic black cyberpunk

377
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
style road racing bicycle how do you

378
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,839
optimize for

379
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,519
this so the first way we looked at this

380
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,800
is we started thinking about it as uh

381
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,240
can I actually help a designer

382
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,199
autocomplete a design so imagine that

383
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,600
you go on a CAD software and you design

384
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,639
half the bicycle and you say you know

385
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,320
what can you just autocomplete my entire

386
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,880
design based on things that you already

387
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,920
know so we looked at this problem as a

388
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,959
problem of missing data from an Excel

389
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,399
sheet so if you have an Excel sheet and

390
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,360
your design can be written down in an

391
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,959
Excel sheet imagine there are some

392
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,639
columns that are missing so these are

393
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,040
the values that are missing we can train

394
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,079
a new type of generative model which can

395
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,800
fill in these values of in the Excel

396
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,240
sheet and it doesn't give you a single

397
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,000
value it gives you a lot of values and

398
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
this key idea is around this diffusion

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,560
imputation model which we work with

400
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,680
Toyota research and we have a Patent

401
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,199
filed for it and we can see that these

402
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,440
diffusion imputation models can really

403
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,920
fill in many values which are diverse so

404
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,160
they don't give you a single option they

405
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,319
give you many options and given an

406
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,600
incomplete CAD model it can complete the

407
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:57,120
cad model in many ways and it can really

408
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,319
show that it not only comes up with good

409
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,319
designs good ways to Auto comp the

410
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:05,120
design but it also comes up with diverse

411
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:07,319
ways so you get a lot of diversity and

412
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,959
also you get low error rates which is

413
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,759
quite promising in helping humans also

414
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,680
we have looked at the idea of the whatif

415
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,120
scenario so if you are a bike designer

416
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,000
and you want to design a bike maybe you

417
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,120
ask can I what if my bike look like this

418
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,600
other bike I found on the internet but

419
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,240
maybe I also want this my bike to be a

420
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,759
futuristic black cyberpunk style and I

421
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,319
also want engineering performance so how

422
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
can you really optimize in this

423
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,120
multimodel space where you have all

424
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,519
these competing objectives and we have

425
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,680
looked at that the current AI models

426
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,639
enable you to do it by combining

427
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,680
optimization and machine learning

428
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,920
representations and the key idea is to

429
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,360
think of it as a counterfactual search

430
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,240
question where you're asking can I

431
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,440
actually make a minimum amount of change

432
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,079
to make the designs really useful but

433
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,399
also meet the new desired requirement so

434
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:01,360
you want to reduce the weight you want

435
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,360
it to be ergonomic and you want it to be

436
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,400
futuristic but broadly speaking like I

437
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,120
think a general question for that comes

438
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,079
up is we are seeing all these Vision

439
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,480
language models large language models

440
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,959
and can they actually help engineering

441
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,959
designers and we did a study on many

442
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,839
many problems in design process from

443
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,520
Material selection understanding

444
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,839
sketches to problems around

445
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,480
manufacturability assessment and a

446
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,440
general takeaway was that for early

447
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,240
stage designs these models are actually

448
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,240
quite good they can really understand

449
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,960
many of the abstract designs which were

450
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,760
surprising we can manufacture some of

451
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,400
the products based on a design sketch

452
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,039
but for more complex designs that

453
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,480
require Precision the models are not

454
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,480
there yet so in this case you're trying

455
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,360
to come up with a cad model with a hole

456
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,280
which is not through and the models

457
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,799
really struggle to do that very well and

458
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,760
this is an area of improvement where the

459
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,320
AI community and the the researchers

460
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,440
should think about how can we increase

461
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,480
Precision on creating better models

462
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,640
and again the key highlight is that we

463
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,080
want to come up with designs that are

464
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,720
suitable for much higher complexity so

465
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,640
we are looking at complexity of not just

466
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,640
chairs and tables but multiple component

467
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,520
designs that we want to aim for to

468
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,400
really help designers and when doing

469
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,039
this like when we are creating these

470
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,919
Foundation large language models

471
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,320
ourselves I think a key question we

472
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,240
asked was can we even evaluate our

473
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,159
designs so given a new AI model like

474
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,440
let's let's say we come up with a new

475
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,000
vision language model how do we really

476
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,440
know it's better and to do that we

477
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,840
started working with the MIT Motorsports

478
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,960
team and we started looking at this idea

479
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,000
that for any designer a large chunk of

480
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,960
their time and a large chunk of their

481
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,720
frustration is based on reading a huge

482
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,080
design rule book and understanding

483
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,760
what's in there so we looked at a design

484
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,720
rule book and we said Can these

485
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,000
generative AI models understand design

486
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,480
rule books and answer questions about

487
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,440
CAD model so for this we created uh

488
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,440
Benchmark problems so based on our

489
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,640
actual mit's Motorsports CAD models and

490
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,919
questions from it we created these

491
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,120
questions on like can you extract the

492
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,840
rules can you actually find what are the

493
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,840
dimensions in this drawing can you tell

494
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,000
me if this rule is being followed or not

495
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,200
in this design and so on and across the

496
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,039
board I think a common message was that

497
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,360
the current generative AI models are not

498
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,480
there yet for very complex

499
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,320
uh questions in this although there is a

500
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,480
lot of promise that we are seeing with

501
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,919
new models performing much better than

502
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,360
the previous

503
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,919
models so that's more about helping

504
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,679
humans so we talked about assisting

505
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,280
optimization helping humans and I want

506
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,840
to wrap up with a third part around much

507
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,400
complex design spaces and these are

508
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,200
problems in very large discrete and

509
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,600
continuous spaces we use the example of

510
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,159
mechanical linkage mechanism design so

511
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,400
for folks who are

512
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,039
new to linkage mechanism design if you

513
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,480
see a robot walking or if you looking at

514
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:09,760
your car wipers or many other like

515
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,039
robotic designs these are often driven

516
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,880
by mechanical linkages so in this

517
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,320
diagram this is my student trying to

518
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,520
come up with a linkage design where they

519
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,520
have a motor which is running and they

520
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,159
have to come up with what is connected

521
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,240
to what and where those positions are

522
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,280
and their goal is this path following

523
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,840
problem where they want the mechanism to

524
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,000
tr to come up with a

525
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,720
path that can be exactly like this now

526
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,960
this is considered more of an art and

527
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,480
science than science and the reason is

528
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,120
it's extremely hard problem so this is

529
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,520
commercial softwares and how they

530
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,919
perform for a test curve and you can see

531
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,919
that they come up with some solutions

532
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,080
but they're not as good and the reason

533
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,799
is that first many models are restricted

534
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,880
to four bars and six bars but more

535
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
importantly this problem is both

536
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,679
discrete and continuous like positions

537
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,200
are continuous connections are discrete

538
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,720
which makes the machine learning problem

539
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,520
extremely hard so we started with

540
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,880
thinking about this problem by creating

541
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,039
a solver which was thousand times faster

542
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,840
than the previous best solver and we

543
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,760
with that we could create a data set of

544
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,360
100 million planer mechanisms and these

545
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,480
are all random mechanisms they don't do

546
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,000
anything particularly well they're just

547
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,640
creating and working uh creating shapes

548
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,440
that are random so this is a billion

549
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,360
curves that we can create with that and

550
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,720
then the interesting part came first is

551
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,600
without doing any machine learning we

552
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,240
can just retrieve from that data set and

553
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,919
you can come up with very fast methods

554
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,760
to do retrieval and that already often

555
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,039
performs better than commercial

556
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,559
softwares but more importantly we came

557
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,720
up with this idea of multimodal learning

558
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,720
where you have to think about different

559
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,200
modalities of design so in this case the

560
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,000
linkage mechanism is a graph and the

561
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,720
curves or the performance are these

562
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,320
curves and this can be incomplete or

563
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,279
complete sketches and you can learn

564
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,840
these joint representations for this

565
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,960
using this idea of contrastive learning

566
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,600
which is the model which is the same uh

567
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,080
similar idea which are driving many of

568
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,400
the text to image models and by doing

569
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,760
that we can uh learn joint

570
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,919
representations and there's there's more

571
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,279
on how to actually come up with better

572
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,360
graph models specialized for these

573
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,279
engineering problems happy to discuss

574
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,360
that in

575
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:23,360
Q&A but the key idea is that we by doing

576
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,159
these uh joint representations now we

577
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,559
can solve this problem much much faster

578
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,520
so something that took 45 minutes now we

579
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,559
we can take a a few seconds and we can

580
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,159
also come up with mechanisms which are

581
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,080
extremely precise so now we are taking 2

582
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,799
minutes compared to 40 minutes the new

583
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,960
version is actually 20 seconds and we

584
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:46,039
also have much less error compared to

585
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,840
state-of-the Art so these are existing

586
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,360
designs existing targets that people

587
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,240
have published and we can come up with

588
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,720
designs almost instantaneously we also

589
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,760
found that we can comp generate designs

590
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,360
which are much more complex than

591
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,120
anything that existed and in some sense

592
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,679
this gave us a notion of automated

593
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,760
Discovery because before this it was not

594
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,640
very clear on what is possible with a

595
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,760
single motor so what are the mechanisms

596
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,919
that you can actually create and the

597
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,120
reason why it was not clear is so this

598
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,960
is just my student drawing like showing

599
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,640
you live on how to come up with

600
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,000
Solutions very fast I'll Skip and like

601
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,000
you can see that the method comes up

602
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,760
within a few seconds and you can

603
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,840
download the cad model and look at the

604
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,840
3D structure of the

605
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,559
design but the key idea the key

606
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,120
Challenge on why this is hard is because

607
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,039
of it's a comp mixed integer problem and

608
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,799
if I only give you the entire mechanism

609
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:47,360
and fix everything except one node

610
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,679
everything in red is where this node

611
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,000
will not work so if even if you change

612
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,880
it slightly and you have some tolerance

613
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,760
errors the mechanism will lock and it

614
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,679
will not work so this shows that for

615
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,039
very complex engineering problems it

616
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,600
almost becomes um a problem of Discovery

617
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,799
because we don't know which problems can

618
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,520
be solved and we can also build in a lot

619
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,960
of manufacturability constraint so that

620
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,880
it can be manufactured it doesn't

621
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,080
collide with each other and the key

622
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,919
ideas again this is a general model so

623
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,840
you can apply it for molecule Design

624
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,960
Network system design and so on so with

625
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,000
that I think I give a quick overview of

626
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,200
helping with Precision generative AI

627
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
helping humans and also solving problems

628
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,880
that were not possible to solve to a

629
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,520
large extent ENT uh very quickly but we

630
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
are thinking about how the Next

631
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,960
Generation a AI will look like and a lot

632
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,120
of it boils down to of course extremely

633
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,960
high quality data raw internet data

634
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,520
sensor data how can we capture existing

635
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,559
worker knowledge capture physics and

636
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,559
first principles as well as the rules

637
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,200
and designs that humans have come up and

638
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:54,399
they are extremely good for most

639
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,120
problems and the next generation is also

640
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:58,559
thinking about how can we really come up

641
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,360
with tools that can help people without

642
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,159
requiring a lot of training so with that

643
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,240
like we think about creating methods

644
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,880
that can create better designs faster

645
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,279
accelerating scientific discovery and

646
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,000
enabling design

647
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,880
democratization and I think when I think

648
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,919
about design democratization I really

649
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,840
want to emphasize this because I've

650
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:19,600
looked at this idea of kinematic design

651
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,880
and I asked chat GPT to come up with a

652
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,600
poem and it comes up with robotic arms

653
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,080
with joints of fine move with Grace in a

654
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,840
straight line and in some sense it's

655
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,960
democratizing language for people who

656
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,480
are not necessarily trained to write

657
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,200
poems similarly we can do art where you

658
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,640
create a doodle and it can create very

659
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,039
good art for this my question often is

660
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,559
like how can we as a community take

661
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,559
design and think about design

662
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,039
democratization so this is from a

663
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,799
industry problem that I worked on and

664
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,600
can we just ask Alexa to design a stand

665
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,559
for my Railway wagon and it can come up

666
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,600
with CAD models generate preferences

667
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,880
simulate performance and make sure it

668
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,320
can be manufactured with that I'm happy

669
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,039
to discuss questions thank you and if

670
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,279
you are in the area happy to chat about

671
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,279
these

672
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,120
topics so so thank you very much indeed

673
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,440
for like thoroughly engaging talk there

674
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,520
I think really kind of gets to this uh

675
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,640
question of how the new approaches to a

676
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,279
completely changing our relationship

677
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,159
with knowledge of various forms how it's

678
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,200
going to be kind of encapsulate into the

679
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,559
the tools and processes and platforms

680
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
that that we all use
