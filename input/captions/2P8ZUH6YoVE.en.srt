1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,840
okay uh let me go ahead and get started

2
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:27,599
um so you know today I'm starting my uh

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,000
uh week on uh static competition so um

4
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,679
you know think about what's going on

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,680
here you know I so so far the first two

6
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,960
weeks have mostly been Monopoly models

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,480
obviously you know most comp most

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,200
Industries or most things have interest

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,039
have multiple firms in it so you know

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,160
I'm going to now start you know every

11
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,120
lecture for the rest of the term it's

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,719
going to be multiple firms competing um

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,879
you know and terroll goes through his

14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,719
book he does sort of this long run to

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,480
Short Run chart where he sort of talks

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039
about you know in the short run firms

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,280
can basically do nothing in competing

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
with each other other than setting

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,719
prices and then you get this sequence of

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,960
variables that take longer and longer to

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,320
adjust and I think the way his book is

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,680
written is is in some sense the you know

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,080
the way we solve models is always by

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,400
backward like multi-stage games by

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,640
backward induction you solve the last

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,960
stage and the next to last stage and the

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,240
next to last stage and so you know his

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,119
book is sort of written this way where

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,720
you go backward from here and that's you

30
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,200
know kind of how my course is written

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,799
although these days it's really going to

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,759
be an awful lot of discussion of this

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,040
and then other things just as individual

34
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,520
topics okay um but so the next few weeks

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,880
it's going to be short-run things um you

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,840
know when we're discussing short-run

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,520
competition what we talk about one of

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,640
the things big things we talk about is

39
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,479
is um uh markups we talk about markups a

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,680
lot because markups lead to dead weight

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,719
loss that's a major welfare concern um

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,880
but they're also going to be you know

43
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,079
just like in price discrimination you

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,399
got that sort of second welfare concern

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
of the you know misallocation of the

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,240
goods that are being sold will also get

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,920
sort of you know Mis purchased sing of

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,880
goods that becomes another consideration

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,399
here as well okay so what I'm going to

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,320
do in this lecture is I'm going to start

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,360
with all of the classic stuff in I/O

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,400
that people don't do anymore but sort of

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,599
do that as I think background for things

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,080
that you know is how modern sort of

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,080
studies of competition are done uh so

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
anyway I start and I you know I'm

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,720
talking about old historical stuff and

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,239
you know put up I added some pictures of

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,080
the old old dead white guys who sort of

60
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,360
developed these things so there's Corno

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,000
uh uh Coro compet

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,160
1838 so you know obviously Kono was

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
thinking about a world that's very

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,920
different from ours a world in which

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,440
many of the things that people bought

66
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,599
were like completely undifferentiated

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,879
Goods like wheat and corn and wool or

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,239
whatever where it just sort of a product

69
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,080
is a product and there's sort of a

70
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,519
universal market for it so Coro thought

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
about a model where you had n firms

72
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,560
there was some homogeneous good that

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,080
they were all producing that had inverse

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,360
demand P ofx the producers have cost

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,080
functions CI of XI that depend on what

76
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,400
is the quantity produced by firm uh

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,959
I Coro you in some sense Coro invented

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,319
Nash equilibrium so Coro thought of the

79
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,000
model he had this sort of timing where

80
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,959
the firms are simultaneously choosing

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,200
outputs X1 through

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,519
xn when they choose those outputs

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,120
they're sort of going to all bring their

84
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,720
goods to the market there's going to be

85
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,799
a market determined

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,200
price and all the firms are choosing

87
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,799
their quantity assuming that the

88
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,280
quantities chosen by the other firms are

89
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,799
all held fixed and that's going to be

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,040
the optimality

91
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,480
condition

92
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,640
um okay what happens in chono

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,720
competition so you know in chono

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
competition right the firm is maximizing

95
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,000
over

96
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,720
XI um

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,159
XI

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,159
times P of x i plus sum over J different

99
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,480
from I

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,599
XJ minus CI of

101
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,680
XI okay so that's every firm's

102
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,480
maximization problem is maximize

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,720
quantity times the market price minus

104
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,479
the cost your quantity affects how much

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,680
you produce it ends up affecting the

106
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:24,360
market price through its impact on the

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,040
aggregate on the aggregate supply and it

108
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,919
obviously affects our cost of

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,479
production you know so what do we get

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,320
well you know if a profile is an ash

111
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,199
equilibrium it's got to

112
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,280
satisfy um first order condition for

113
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,880
this for each ey what does the first

114
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,600
order condition look like

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,039
um you know so first it's you know this

116
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,840
times the derivative of this gives you

117
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:52,400
you get a p of the sum of the XIs minus

118
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,160
derivative of this is marginal cost the

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,360
third term in the in the thing is um uh

120
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,199
XI times the derivative of that so we

121
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,639
get

122
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,160
Pi Prime Time XI star equals z okay so

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,479
this is sort of what the classic Corno

124
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,479
first order condition looks

125
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,400
like what are some implications so first

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,039
of all um price exceeds price ends up

127
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,039
greater than marginal cost right this is

128
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,360
price minus marginal cost is the first

129
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,600
term XI is a if XI is a positive number

130
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,400
P Prime is a negative number so this is

131
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,680
price minus marginal cost equals minus

132
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,000
Pi Prime XI is a positive

133
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,759
number um production in a Corno so we

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,080
get a second welfare loss in a Corno

135
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,440
oligopoly so first welfare loss is

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,840
there's dead weight loss second is

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,600
production is inefficient in a cornal

138
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,880
oligopoly production is inefficient in

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,919
an asymmetric oligopoly because if in if

140
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,759
the firms are asymmetric in equilibrium

141
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,600
x1's going to be different from X2 if

142
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,720
x1's different from X2 and P Prime is

143
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,160
the same for everyone because it's

144
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,919
evaluated at the aggregate demand then

145
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,440
that means and the p is the same for

146
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,160
everyone that means the C primes have to

147
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,039
be

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:18,360
different um so in an asymmetric

149
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,759
corop um the realized marginal costs are

150
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,319
different so the quantity that's being

151
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,919
produced is being produced

152
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,120
inefficiently um okay you know example

153
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,960
to think about this is you know for

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,520
um uh you know if you think about model

155
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,160
for producing oil in the world today is

156
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,800
something like a Corno oligopoly there's

157
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
a set of countries every country you

158
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,520
know the ones we're centrally producing

159
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,520
or choosing how much to cons how much to

160
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,160
produce if each country is sort of

161
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,280
maximizing its production then you know

162
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,039
you're going to have countries like

163
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,039
Saudi Arabia has oil that they could

164
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,880
pump out of the ground for $5 a barrel

165
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,280
or $10 a barrel they're not pumping it

166
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,199
out of the ground Canada is getting oil

167
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,720
out of tarand for $50 a barrel and you

168
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,800
know there's sort an inefficiency there

169
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,800
from lowc cost producers not producing

170
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,360
while high cost producers are producing

171
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,280
holding the quantity

172
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,759
fixed okay um firm outputs are usually

173
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,280
strategic substitutes so if you look at

174
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,520
a Coro model if I put q1 on this axis

175
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,360
and do what's the best response for firm

176
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,000
2 to an output of q1 uh you get this

177
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,120
downward sloping uh line and you know

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,599
the equilibrium looks like this if I put

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,280
Q2 on this axis and graph

180
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,919
br1

181
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,520
Q2 you know Coro equilibrium is

182
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,720
typically this sort of intersection of

183
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,599
two downward sloping

184
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,120
lines okay that's what it normally looks

185
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,639
like uh it doesn't have to look like

186
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,199
that and the Kono equilibrium is not

187
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,360
always unique you could imagine if you

188
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,319
could sort of somehow draw these things

189
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
with Wiggles in them that they intersect

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,680
multiple

191
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,159
times um okay uh fourth result of this

192
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,879
you know take this uh expression price

193
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:08,960
Minus cost is minus XI star P

194
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,319
Prime uh and then divide both sides by

195
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,720
Price uh I get an expression that looks

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,720
very much like the Monopoly pricing

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,400
expression except it has an XI star on

198
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,240
the right hand side instead of having an

199
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,919
X star on the right side but it's some

200
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,000
sense this is the Monopoly first store

201
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,440
condition so because this is the

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,840
Monopoly for store condition except with

203
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,399
an XI here instead of a capital X here

204
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,640
uh I get this expression price minus

205
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,000
marginal cost over price is minus XI

206
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,839
over xar time 1 over Epsilon so if we

207
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,560
think about how does competition reduce

208
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,120
markups in the Coro

209
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,519
model obviously you know elasticities if

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,839
you don't have a constant elasticity

211
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,839
demand curve elasticities also change as

212
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,040
output changes because you know the

213
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,399
elasticity is non constant but if you

214
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,800
think about the rough constant

215
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,880
elasticity intuition this is going to

216
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,519
say that you know with n for molopoly

217
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,839
prices are going to go down roughly like

218
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,640
one over n um and you know this is sort

219
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,000
of one of the features that made Coro

220
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,800
popular is that people have this

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,360
intuition with Monopoly prices are high

222
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,079
as you get more competition in prices

223
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,440
ought to decline and they ought to

224
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,079
decline you know in some decreasing

225
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
returns to competition way and they

226
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,560
ought to ASM toote to perfect

227
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,120
competition as the number of firms goes

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,920
to Infinity uh and Coro has those

229
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
properties and and that's you know one

230
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,360
of the reasons why it became a popular

231
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,360
model to use

232
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,160
um okay notice that you know like

233
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,040
marginal costs are different with

234
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,880
asymmetric firms learner indexes are

235
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,120
different with asymmetric firms because

236
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,279
each firm's markup is uh XI over xar and

237
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,920
so the XIs are not all one over n in

238
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,480
equilibrium the markups are different

239
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,519
but so we can think about sort of like

240
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,040
what is the average markup in an

241
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:01,640
industry across firms so let's define

242
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,360
the industry wide learner index to be

243
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,560
price minus average marginal cost over

244
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,079
price where we take a weighted average

245
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,279
of the marginal costs giving weight you

246
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,720
know XI over xar so we give more weight

247
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,680
to the firms that are producing more so

248
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,040
this is sort of price minus average

249
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,440
marginal cost over price uh theorem is

250
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,079
that you know and you can just this is

251
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,279
just basically taking a weighted average

252
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,079
of these weighting them by XI so the

253
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,320
theorem is that

254
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,720
um average IND the industry average

255
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,880
learner index is um negative H over

256
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Epsilon where H is the sum of XI over

257
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,279
xstar

258
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,720
squared okay so it's this H is the sum

259
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:53,360
of the squared market shares and so you

260
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,880
know the Coro model predicts that um you

261
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,279
know the Coro model predicts that the

262
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,040
markup in an

263
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,160
industry um depends on

264
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,279
sum of squared market shares and some of

265
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,959
squared markup shares is a sort of

266
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,480
summary statistic for how large markups

267
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,240
are and you know this was sufficiently

268
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,639
uh influential that if you go back and

269
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,880
read like how us merger guidelines were

270
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,720
designed in the

271
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,160
1950s they explicitly refer to herend

272
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,800
doll indexes and they're explicitly

273
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,920
referring to herand doll indexes in the

274
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,000
sense of like you know

275
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,000
if I even forget what these numbers are

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,079
but there's something like this you know

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,079
if the herend doll index in an industry

278
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:35,279
is less than .18 then we will allow

279
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:40,440
mergers and if the per dollar Index is

280
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,880
between .18 and. 28 and the Delta

281
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,880
H you know then what we'll do is look at

282
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,360
whether Delta H is less than or greater

283
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,120
than

284
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,399
0.01 and they will tend to sort of

285
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,480
consider mergers as questionable or not

286
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,519
depending on whether the change in the

287
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,040
herand index is bigger or smaller than

288
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,720
0.001 and then for Industries where the

289
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,200
herel is already above 0. 28 then

290
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,040
they're going to be sort of uh you know

291
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,440
then they're then mergers are typically

292
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,399
not going to be allowed but this is just

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,600
the you know because the herend doll

294
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,399
index had this role in the theorem that

295
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,839
it was a measure of how competitive an

296
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,839
industry was it took this very Central

297
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,279
role in in in competition and if you

298
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,079
also if you look at the you know I

299
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,639
discussed the sort of cross industry

300
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,800
cross-section IO uh from the 1960s

301
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,560
constant regressions of markups on Hind

302
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,639
doll indexes because herend index was

303
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,680
supposed to be the correct measure of

304
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,639
how concentrated an industry was um one

305
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,760
thing to note though you know you

306
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,240
definitely should not be thinking of the

307
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,519
her andal index as a welfare proxy

308
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,240
because you know you think about it it

309
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,600
it's measuring markups relative to the

310
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,120
cost they're there but so for instance

311
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,320
you know if you have two firms that are

312
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,959
perfectly symmetric the herel index is

313
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,399
05 uh it's 1 half squared plus 1 half

314
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,760
squared is 0.5 suppose one of those

315
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,600
firms gets more efficient and lowers its

316
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,079
cost when it lowers its cost everyone is

317
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,959
better off

318
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
you know social welfare goes up but the

319
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,160
hind doll index also goes up because the

320
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,440
firm with a lower cost now starts uh

321
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,120
producing a higher share of the

322
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,680
output

323
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,720
okay okay um you know in the old days uh

324
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,279
one could you know and I I let me say I

325
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,120
think big mistakes students still make

326
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,800
today is trying to be too original I

327
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,839
mean I think almost the best way to do

328
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,839
research especially when you're starting

329
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,880
out is always to take some existing

330
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,959
paper and improve on it because if you

331
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,279
take an existing paper you improve on it

332
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,519
you've got something better than an

333
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,959
existing published paper whereas you

334
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,000
know you start from scratch with some

335
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,639
creative idea you spend years on it and

336
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,279
then you realize two years later that

337
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,320
we've done is created a worse version of

338
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,760
something that already exists whereas if

339
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,839
you know you start with the existing

340
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,639
Frontier paper you know where the

341
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,839
frontier is you improve on it you've got

342
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,720
a frontier New Frontier paper okay but

343
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,399
anyway back in the day um you know Kau

344
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,120
was

345
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,880
1838 uh berran 45 years later picks up

346
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,279
coro's paper and say I can come up with

347
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:06,680
an interesting comment on Corno so his

348
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,759
comment on Corno was that you know many

349
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,759
firms don't choose the quantity that

350
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,000
they're going to produce what they do is

351
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,720
instead set a price for their product

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,160
and then sell however much at that price

353
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,040
as people are willing to buy um so he

354
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,199
just sort of flipped around this

355
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,839
discussion from firms choosing

356
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:28,320
quantities treating everyone's quantity

357
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,560
is fixed to firms choosing prices and

358
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,720
his comment is basically that

359
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,079
predictions of corob model change

360
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,839
dramatically if you make that simple

361
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,519
flip from firms are choosing quantities

362
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,240
assuming quantities are fixed the firms

363
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,720
are choosing prices assuming prices are

364
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,040
fixed um so anyway brr model you know

365
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:50,440
let X be a market demand function assume

366
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,639
that X is weekly decreasing and that P *

367
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,120
X of p is

368
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,600
bounded uh assume that all firms have

369
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,519
Market have unit cost C firms

370
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,240
simultaneous announce prices all demand

371
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,600
goes to the low price firms uh then uh

372
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,360
we don't get this sort of Coro

373
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,279
continuity we get a immediate

374
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,399
discontinuity which is two firms is

375
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,600
enough for perfect competition so the

376
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,079
unique equilibrium of this model is P1

377
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,240
star equals P2 star equals

378
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,680
c and you know this is what you know

379
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,079
Frank fiser is sort of writing about

380
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
economic theory would sort of say this

381
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:27,800
is an exemplifying Theory you know you

382
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,720
sort of make these somewhat extreme

383
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,600
assumptions that is you know firms

384
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,199
announce prices and all demand goes to

385
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,759
the lowest price firm even if it's one

386
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,959
penny less than the other firm but what

387
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,920
you show is that with these assumptions

388
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,639
you get this sort of extreme outcome

389
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,480
which is competition Works different for

390
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,240
Le from kruno when it's a discontinuous

391
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,959
thing and any number of firms is enough

392
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,720
to have perfect competition okay um you

393
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,240
know one version of this model that

394
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,920
still does get used is if you think

395
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,160
about firms that have asymmetric costs

396
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,480
you have two firms with cost C1 star and

397
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,440
C2 star

398
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,959
what's the

399
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,440
equilibrium uh the equilibrium is the

400
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,440
firms end up both pricing at C2 star

401
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,519
with all of the demand going to firm the

402
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
firm with a lower cost um if you want

403
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,759
you can think of it as firm one as

404
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,920
charging C2 minus Epsilon and getting

405
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,680
all the demand um but sort of when you

406
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,319
have asymmetric

407
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Corno uh prices are determined by the

408
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:23,160
second lowest cost in a market and I

409
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,560
think that's the important intuition

410
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,920
that's sort of like the second lowest

411
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,279
cost determines what happens in markets

412
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,240
that are you with this very int intense

413
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,920
price competition or on differentiated

414
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,000
products does this change have

415
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,040
information on the cost

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,720
um yeah so let me see so if you did this

417
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,839
model where you had um private you don't

418
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,880
have knowledge on their

419
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,199
distribution yeah so in some sense if

420
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,399
you have um private information on costs

421
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,800
um this is some sense that that's that's

422
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,399
what we normally refer to as an auction

423
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,279
model you know right like it's an

424
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,560
auction I don't know what the of the

425
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,919
painting is to you you don't know the

426
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,559
value of the painting is to me so I bid

427
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,039
something giving myself some expected

428
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,240
markup because you know if I bid cost

429
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,199
then if I win or If I Lose I'm I'm

430
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,839
unhappy both ways and so I bid something

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,240
in between well in the buying something

432
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,760
I bid something in between you know my

433
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,079
value and zero and you do the same thing

434
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,600
and we get some and we get positive

435
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,080
markups for that reason yeah so that

436
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,400
that becomes a you know like in the uh

437
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,039
you know values uniform 01 model you bid

438
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,600
v over2 as the equilibrium so it's some

439
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,880
sense that that is a

440
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,679
model you end up reconstructing

441
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,960
something kind of like Coro that you get

442
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,640
positive markups and as the number of

443
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,360
firms goes to Infinity the markups go to

444
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,720
zero so that would be another way to get

445
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,720
a Coro like

446
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,360
prediction um anyway I I do talk about

447
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,039
I'll I'll do auctions in in like week

448
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,200
eight or whatever but we actually get

449
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,480
that um you know the place where that

450
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,520
analogy is more direct is like

451
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,919
procurement auctions you have auctions

452
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,320
for contracts to pave a road in the city

453
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,159
of Cambridge uh and those are allocated

454
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,720
by auction and exactly you don't know

455
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,000
what the rivals costs are going to be

456
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,120
for that Paving job so both of you bid

457
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:18,760
some mark up hoping to win

458
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:21,880
yeah um okay um you know comment on

459
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:26,159
again go forward another 46 years um

460
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,840
comment on uh uh Kau compet comment on

461
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,280
berran competition by Harold hotelling

462
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,159
uh and I I wanted to put him here

463
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,320
because um Harold hotelling is my great

464
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,559
great grand adviser um so you know

465
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,600
hotelling was Arrow's adviser Arrow was

466
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,400
mask's advisor masin was feenberg's

467
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,640
adviser Drew was my adviser um so anyway

468
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,440
some fondness for Harold hotelling um he

469
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,240
actually and you know you know he was

470
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,159
actually um so if you go look at my

471
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,159
advisor family tree um they're all

472
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,039
mathematicians Beyond some point like so

473
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:00,679
you get to all those friend

474
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,080
mathematicians you know whose names you

475
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,919
hear in probability Theory whatever

476
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,480
because hotelling has PhD in math rather

477
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,919
than uh in economics so like my family

478
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,159
tree goes back sort of you know three

479
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,520
branches in economics and then

480
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,200
everyone's a mathematician from that

481
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,440
point forward like for hoteling advisers

482
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,799
um but anyway you know hotelling through

483
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,360
Mo well mostly through having advised

484
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,280
can Arrow hoteling does have like a

485
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,200
thousand over a thousand descendants um

486
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,880
you know brand advises or whatever um so

487
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,360
anyway so hoteling and and I actually

488
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,679
you know I love Hotel tellings writing

489
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,000
also you sort of get him to sort of you

490
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,400
know he's got this sort of very you know

491
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,720
in some sense self-confident but trying

492
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,400
to be understated style of this of sort

493
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,880
of um you know after the work of the

494
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,159
late professor edworth one may doubt

495
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,559
that anything further can be said on the

496
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,039
theory of competition however one

497
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,840
important feature seems to have escaped

498
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:53,400
scrutiny this is the fact that uh of all

499
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,080
the purchasers of commodity some buy

500
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,600
from one some from another in spite of

501
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,679
the moderate differences in price and

502
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,880
that say that price reaction should be

503
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,240
ous rather than non-differentiable as

504
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,440
they are in beran's model and then

505
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,240
working out the friction so anyway um

506
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,000
you know hoteling's

507
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,120
model is and in some sense hoteling is

508
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,440
open the path that everyone has followed

509
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,320
since which is thinking about

510
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,880
competition in terms of heterogeneous

511
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,720
consumer populations and some underlying

512
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,919
type space of consumer of heterogeneous

513
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:32,480
consumers um so he had this sort of line

514
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:35,919
uh where he had consumers arranged on uh

515
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,720
01 um and actually you know hoteling

516
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,720
spent a lot of his career at UCLA and I

517
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,039
think was thinking about this as a beach

518
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,799
uh in Southern California um you know

519
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,240
and so hotelling did have the sort of

520
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,600
model you can think of is you've got

521
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,640
sort of the two you know uh two two

522
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,679
stands on the beach each one selling

523
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,159
drinks and hot dogs and ice cream or

524
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,600
whatever and then you have all the

525
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,960
customers who are lying on blankets

526
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,480
somewhere along the beach and then when

527
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,039
they want to get something to drink they

528
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,400
pick up and they walk to the nearest

529
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,400
stand and then they buy something and

530
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,880
then they walk back to where they were

531
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,600
sitting on the beach okay so his model

532
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:17,679
is we have these consumers and there

533
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,679
utilities um so I put fet on this

534
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:24,480
axis so then if I graph the utility that

535
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,400
you get buying uh

536
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,480
consumer of type Theta buying from firm

537
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,760
one I get utility that looks like this V

538
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,559
minus t * Theta minus

539
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,480
P1 so that would be my utility of buying

540
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:44,080
from firm

541
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:46,919
one and then uh consumers also have a

542
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:51,200
utility of buying from firm two uh so

543
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:56,440
let me on this axis put uh V this is V

544
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:59,840
minus T1 minus Theta minus

545
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,000
P2 so you know the argument is that you

546
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,039
know T is

547
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,200
my dis utility per unit of distance

548
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,880
walking and so my utility from buying

549
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,400
the product from firm 1 is V minus t *

550
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,679
Theta because Theta captures my distance

551
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:19,360
minus P1 and if I buy from firm two it's

552
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,360
V minus t * 1us Theta minus

553
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,480
P2 and so uh you know he did this in a

554
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,240
one diim this one-dimensional type space

555
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,520
captures your preference for both Goods

556
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,279
and so he assumed there's a constant

557
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,760
marginal cost C he considered again you

558
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,080
know the Nash equilibrium before Nash of

559
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,919
firms simultaneously announce prices P1

560
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:45,000
and P2 and then firms announce those

561
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,080
prices it's a simultaneous move game and

562
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,520
then consumers decide who to buy from

563
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,480
and then the firms earn their profits

564
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,760
and it we just look for the static Nash

565
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,799
equilibrium okay um you know the

566
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,760
standard case we discuss in this model

567
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,760
is if V is large

568
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,679
then there's some consumer Theta hat

569
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,600
who's indifferent between buying the two

570
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:11,880
products so this consumer Theta hat has

571
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:17,480
v minus t Theta hat minus

572
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,760
P1 equal V minus t 1 minus Theta hat

573
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,440
minus

574
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,120
P2 so at those prices that consumer is

575
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,559
indifferent between the two

576
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,279
products you solve that equation and it

577
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,440
tells you that the indifferent consumer

578
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,440
Theta hat

579
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,240
is uh 12 + P2 minus P1 over

580
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,559
2T with that in consumer do I have on

581
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,400
the next slide or not um so with that

582
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,880
indifferent consumer then you get you

583
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:55,240
know X1 of P1

584
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:59,400
P2 is 12 plus P2 minus P1 /

585
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:05,720
2T and X2 of P1 1

586
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:10,120
P2 is 12 minus P2 - P1 over

587
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:13,559
2T okay the demands add up to one if as

588
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,200
long as this consumer is willing to As

589
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,159
Long As V is large enough this consumer

590
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,440
is willing to buy so everyone buys from

591
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,440
one firm or the other so there's no dead

592
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
weight loss in this model everything you

593
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:29,960
know demands end up being independent of

594
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,799
V so this is if uh whatever um

595
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:37,250
V minus t

596
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,559
* 12 + P2 minus P1 over

597
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,440
[Music]

598
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,240
2T uh minus P1 greater than equal to

599
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,640
zero so as long as

600
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,080
this indifferent consumer is willing to

601
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,960
buy demands are completely independent

602
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,520
of v and just are these linear you know

603
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,039
these are linear demand curves so what

604
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,320
he's done is he's just sort of proposed

605
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,960
this model of heterogeneous consumer

606
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,520
populations and said with that het

607
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,640
heterogeneous consumer population model

608
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,720
we just get price

609
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,120
competition with these particular linear

610
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,120
demand

611
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,480
curves and what happens when you have

612
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,159
those linear demand curves

613
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:26,000
well you know firm I is just maximizing

614
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:29,640
price Minus cost time 12 plus um PJ

615
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,240
minus p over 2T so if it sets a higher

616
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,000
price it gets a higher markup per

617
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,760
consumer but the number of consumers go

618
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,240
down uh with one over two t being the

619
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,520
slope of the downward sloping individual

620
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,279
demand you know demand curve facing

621
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,600
it uh I take the first order conditions

622
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,720
for this it's just algebra and given

623
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,760
that it's a linear demand curve we get a

624
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,960
quadratic objective function it has an

625
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,000
interior maximum uh and what we get is

626
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,640
the best response for firm I to a price

627
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,760
PJ

628
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,760
is 12 of C + t plus

629
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,760
PJ

630
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,520
so if I try to graph What's Happening

631
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,200
Here P1

632
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:20,679
P2 so if P1 is zero the best response

633
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,679
for firm 2 is 1 12 C plus T is

634
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,440
positive and then it's a line that's

635
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:28,840
upward sloping so this is the best

636
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,159
response for firm two

637
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:37,799
to a price of

638
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:37,799
P1 okay and this is uh 12 C plus

639
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,480
T and then similarly the best response

640
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,520
for firm

641
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,240
uh one to a price of P2 is going to look

642
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,720
like

643
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,880
this so I'm graphing firm One's best

644
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,440
response you know I'm graphing this

645
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,559
thing backwards as you do in Game Theory

646
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,520
where sort of as P2 is higher I'm

647
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,360
graphing P1 is higher but this line has

648
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,360
slope 1/2 relative to this this one has

649
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,919
slope 1/2 if you view it as a function

650
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,440
of this line so we get these two upward

651
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,679
sloping lines they

652
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:20,600
intersect that's the equilibrium and we

653
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,600
get P1 staral P2 staral C plus

654
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:29,640
T um so what are the sort of economic

655
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,960
imple implications here one is that you

656
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,440
know markups are proportional to the

657
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,799
product differentiation parameter T so

658
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,480
it's the amount of product

659
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:41,799
differentiation in a market that ends up

660
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,799
determining how large are the how large

661
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,120
are the

662
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,440
markups okay um you know the hotter it

663
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,039
is and the more unpleasant it is to walk

664
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,760
across the sand the higher will be the

665
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,200
prices um and you know people today I

666
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,159
think use this model you know not just

667
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:03,440
for differentiation in physical space

668
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,960
driving but like differentiation in

669
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,399
taste space as well so if you think

670
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,039
about competition between Coke and Pepsi

671
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,760
how much do you like Coke how much do

672
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,320
you like Pepsi there are some people who

673
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,559
are love Coke and and dislike Pepsi

674
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,799
there are some who love Pepsi and

675
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,120
dislike Coke there are some who are

676
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,320
completely indifferent between the two

677
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,679
the amount of taste

678
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,519
heterogeneity is what determines the

679
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,760
markups and numerically with these

680
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,279
linear demand curves it's the amount by

681
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,200
which people at one end of the line

682
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,480
versus the other it's the relative

683
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,039
preference of people at one end of the

684
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,279
line versus the other this person thinks

685
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,640
Pepsi is tea better than Coke that

686
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,000
person thinks Coke is tea better than

687
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:46,279
Pepsi tea is the equilibrium mark

688
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,919
up okay um you can do an nirm circular

689
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:52,120
version of this like so imagine that you

690
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,799
have obviously you know there are lots

691
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,559
of parts of the United State well you

692
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,240
know obviously you'd have to all go all

693
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,679
the way down to South America and some

694
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,880
parts no one's going to be the beach but

695
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,960
you could imagine giant Beach that's

696
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,519
just you know we have an resort island

697
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,039
where the beaches just circle around the

698
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:13,080
whole thing um if you put n firms around

699
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:15,159
this it's as if the competition between

700
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,480
any of these two firms is now going to

701
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,080
be like T * 1 over n is going to be the

702
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,120
effective distance between them and so

703
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,159
if T * 1 over n becomes the effective

704
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,519
distance between them you're going to

705
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:34,399
get you know P star

706
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:36,240
= C + T * 1 n so this is a model where

707
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,039
it can be like Coro and as you put more

708
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,440
and more firms into the same finite

709
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,200
dimensional product space markups to

710
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,159
Kine and are continuous with perfect

711
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,240
competition as n goes to

712
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,440
Infinity

713
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,320
um anyway I'll just say later actions

714
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,960
are strategic complements just means

715
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,399
that it the reaction curves look

716
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,799
different from how they looked in Coro

717
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,720
here it's an intersection of upward

718
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,080
sloping lines Coro is an intersection of

719
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,799
downward sloping lines uh that's going

720
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,240
to understanding sort of some of the

721
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,519
implications of the model that's going

722
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,120
to matter

723
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:15,559
later okay um okay any questions on uh

724
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,360
hoteling's

725
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:21,840
model okay

726
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,039
um okay so vertical

727
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,039
differentiation you know final thing we

728
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:28,720
think of is that you know there's many

729
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,279
examples like Coke and Pepsi there's

730
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,440
clearly one is the better product and

731
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,919
one is the sorry there two products are

732
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,440
just a matter of taste whether you like

733
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,200
a versus B there are other examples we

734
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,279
think of where differentiation consists

735
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,440
of one product is better and one is

736
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,559
worse um you know so if you think about

737
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,679
you

738
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,039
know do people want to buy the you know

739
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,159
do people want to buy the sort of BMW or

740
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,960
do they want the Toyota yarus or

741
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,600
something like everybody would rather

742
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,399
have the BMW um like everyone admits

743
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,519
that this product a is better than

744
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,880
product B but the question is how much

745
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,480
are you willing to pay for product a

746
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,760
versus product B okay you could have

747
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,279
again you know this sort of you know

748
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,919
maybe some people still like flip phones

749
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,840
but you know you have the sort of modern

750
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:13,240
phone competing against the old flip

751
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,639
phone you know with just a keypad and a

752
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,679
little screen like this everyone agrees

753
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,799
that the sort of modern phone is the

754
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,000
better phone but people just differ in

755
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,600
how much they're willing to pay for the

756
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,679
better product not ter so the differ the

757
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,159
the consumer preferences here are going

758
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,480
to be vertical rather than hor what call

759
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,960
vertical rather than horizontal so

760
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,399
do this example I've got two firms um

761
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,279
they have Goods of quality SL is my flip

762
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,799
phone sh is my

763
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:40,200
iPhone uh and the lowquality phone

764
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,760
everyone would agree is worse than the

765
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,679
high quality

766
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,360
phone uh we have consumers have types

767
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,320
again distributed on a on a unit

768
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,159
interval or sorry non-unit interval now

769
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,159
Theta lower bar Theta upper bar uh and

770
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,080
the utility functions are going to be

771
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,200
the consumer utility of a consumer of

772
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,440
type Theta buying product I is Theta SI

773
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,000
minus Pi so the Theta is your marginal

774
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,279
value of a unit of quality you could

775
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,279
also just think of this as a model where

776
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:10,799
consumers are differentiated by income

777
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,360
and have a mar different marginal value

778
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,120
of of uh income and therefore you know

779
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,679
they have all the same utility that they

780
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,880
get from higher quality but just some

781
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,639
people have more money than others they

782
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,120
have a greater disutility of spending

783
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:26,519
money okay

784
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,799
um okay and so consumers have this

785
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,080
utility if they buy from firm I they get

786
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,039
zero utility if they buy from neither

787
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,880
firm at

788
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:38,639
all uh I'm going to for Simplicity

789
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,080
assume a unit mass of consumers uh unit

790
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:43,000
density of consumers on interal Theta

791
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,000
lower bar Theta upper

792
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,159
bar okay so what's going on here is um

793
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,080
you know here I'm typically going to

794
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,720
have my Theta space you know often we

795
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,679
have our Theta space start start at zero

796
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,279
but here everybody in my model is going

797
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,480
to light quality so I'm going to sort of

798
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,480
think of a model we have this sort of

799
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,159
interval Theta lower

800
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:09,440
bar Theta upper bar and so

801
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,760
consumers you know consumers are rate on

802
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,760
this interval of positive

803
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,320
values okay so again consider the same

804
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,960
game that um you know Bertrand and

805
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,639
hotelling considered firm simultaneously

806
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,240
choose prices PL and pH taking the other

807
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:30,360
firm's prices fixed consumers decide who

808
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,600
to buy from from and then firms earn

809
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,120
profits that's the end of the

810
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,039
game what do the utilities look like you

811
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,960
know here

812
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:46,360
um dra first draw a line like

813
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,880
this this is the line Theta SL minus

814
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:53,960
PL so it starts at negative

815
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:59,320
PL and then it goes up with a slope of

816
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,320
SL this is the utility that you get

817
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:05,639
you know this is UL L of theta that's

818
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,639
utility you get buying from firm

819
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,320
lals UL L of

820
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,480
theta okay then other line I'm going to

821
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:23,000
draw is firm H has the higher quality

822
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,919
product um so if you had type zero which

823
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,800
nobody does you'd get utility Negative

824
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:28,760
PH from buying that product uh but but

825
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,440
then I'm going to assume that's a

826
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:36,599
steeper sloping line like this Theta sh

827
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,960
minus pH it's a steeper sloping line

828
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:43,000
because uh sh is bigger than SL and the

829
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,599
slope is s the slope is s

830
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,919
okay so what happens in this model again

831
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,480
there's sort of some in equilibrium

832
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,879
there's be some indifferent consumer of

833
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,160
type Theta

834
00:34:51,879 --> 00:35:01,000
hat consumers with types above Theta

835
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:02,320
hat uh so these guys all buy um the high

836
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,280
quality

837
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,680
good these consumers upper envelope is

838
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,640
these guys

839
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,800
by uh the lowquality

840
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,839
good uh as I've drawn it there's another

841
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,480
Point that's of importance called Theta

842
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,560
Prime I'll call Theta Prime I named

843
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,359
Theta Prime in the

844
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,960
slides anyone with a type below Theta

845
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,280
Prime uh is going to buy

846
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,640
nothing because neither good is worth

847
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,640
paying what's being charged

848
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,800
okay you know I've drawn this in the

849
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,079
case where Theta Prime is below Theta

850
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,720
lower bar and Theta hat is between Theta

851
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,200
lower bar and Theta upper bar and in

852
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,160
that case what are the demands um the

853
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,480
demand for the high quality product is

854
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,280
just Theta upper bar minus Theta hat and

855
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,800
the demand for the lowquality product is

856
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,640
Theta hat minus Theta lower

857
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,200
bar if Theta Prime were to the right of

858
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,319
this the demand for the lowquality

859
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,319
product would be Theta hat minus Theta

860
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,760
Prime um but anyway I drew it like this

861
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,280
so this becomes the

862
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,280
equations and then again this Theta hat

863
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,960
satisfies

864
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:20,119
um Theta hat sh minus

865
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:23,960
pH equals Theta hat SL minus

866
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:28,040
PL so that tells you that Theta Hat Time

867
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,040
sh minus SL

868
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,960
equals pH minus

869
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,280
PL you know that gives you this

870
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,920
expression

871
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,079
here uh for what the demand is for

872
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,920
product

873
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,319
H

874
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,760
okay so again it's it's a story um but

875
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:47,160
it's a and it's a story that just

876
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,560
basically what has done is it's just

877
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,400
given us again two linear demand curves

878
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,800
you know these are both you know they're

879
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,560
they've got other parameters in them and

880
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,040
it's not so obvious but you just look at

881
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,240
it's like oh yeah that's just it's a

882
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,319
linear fun function of PL and pH it's a

883
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:05,319
linear function of PL and pH

884
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:07,440
uh uh hotelling was a symmetric linear

885
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,839
model at you know the two demand curves

886
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,680
looked exactly the same here the demand

887
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,760
curves look different um in particular

888
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,680
you know

889
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,240
the firm if the if the prices were equal

890
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,920
everyone would buy from firm H so in

891
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,680
some sense firm H's demand is higher

892
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,200
than firm L's holding the prices fixed

893
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,200
um but that's what the equations look

894
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
like

895
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,000
but they are you know the it's it's just

896
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,880
a shift of demand curves one demand

897
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,079
curve is higher but the the demand

898
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,800
curves are both linear with the same

899
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,800
slope in the two

900
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:48,720
variables okay any any question on that

901
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,359
getting from the equations to the

902
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,000
slopes so that's what our demand model

903
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,119
looks like and then again the question

904
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,240
is like what happens in this

905
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,720
competition and again it's just

906
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,599
uh you know it's it's solving a um uh

907
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,960
it's just solving two equations and two

908
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:10,240
unknowns to find what the demand curves

909
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:16,800
are it really is Not So Different Here

910
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,800
from uh what hotelling did um so if I

911
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,960
plot P1 and P2

912
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,880
again so the best response resp to firm

913
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:33,040
h of a price PL turns out to be if you

914
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,280
remember the other one was 1 12 P plus C

915
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:40,440
plus T so it turns out to be 1 half P

916
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:44,040
plus C plus um instead of T we get Theta

917
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,119
upper bar minus sh minus SL which is

918
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,240
like the amount of differentiation that

919
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:50,119
there is between the two products from

920
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,640
the perspective of the Theta upper bar

921
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,000
consumer so it's a lot like P plus C

922
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,400
plus T but just with the amount of

923
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,680
difference between the products here

924
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,800
being From perspective of of the um High

925
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,200
Theta

926
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:07,119
consumer and so what that looks like is

927
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:12,880
uh you know we start again here if um so

928
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:15,599
we put PL here pH here um so uh it

929
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,319
starts at 1 12 PL plus C plus something

930
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,760
or other so it starts at some positive

931
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:23,599
thing and it goes up with a slope of a

932
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,880
half so this is the best response for

933
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,680
firm H to a price of PL

934
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:36,880
okay and this is

935
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:41,200
uh 12 of C plus Theta upper bar * shus

936
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:45,680
SL now firm L's best response is 12 of

937
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,400
p+ C minus something and so the minus

938
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,160
something is again related to how much

939
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,880
differentiation there is um notice

940
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,079
because like when pH is zero this

941
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,040
becomes 12 of C minus something this

942
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,760
thing could even be negative or it it's

943
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,359
c below C and it could even be negative

944
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,359
number if um differentiate depending on

945
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,960
how big different how big

946
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,400
differentiation is um but so I'll draw

947
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,760
it as like starting as a positive number

948
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,560
but it starts from some smaller amount

949
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,240
and then it also goes up at a slope of a

950
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,960
half so we get

951
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,520
BR

952
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:27,400
h brl of pH looks like

953
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,800
that so this starts from 12 of C minus

954
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:34,560
Theta lower bar time shus

955
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,400
SL okay and given the things both have

956
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,280
slope a half again there's a unique

957
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,599
intersection and it's right there and

958
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,920
you can think of this as PL star comma

959
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,040
pH

960
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,359
star okay and what we get is this

961
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,760
asymmetric equilibrium you know the

962
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,800
formulas look the same but this one's

963
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,359
got twice the bigger number minus the

964
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,680
smaller number and this one has one *

965
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,480
the bigger number minus twice the

966
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,400
smaller number so this is a bigger

967
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,359
number than this

968
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,400
one uh and so what we get is you know

969
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,400
again you know vertical differentiation

970
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,920
just like horizontal differentiation it

971
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,800
creates finite uh demand elasticities it

972
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,520
creates positive markups if you put

973
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,880
uniform distributions on the vertical

974
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,319
tastes it can be linear demand curves

975
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,440
just like the horizontal model is um in

976
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:27,599
equilibrium those different the

977
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,119
differentiation again leads to positive

978
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,520
markups uh it leads to positive markups

979
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:36,760
but it leads to positive markups where

980
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,760
firm H is favored firm L is

981
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,680
disfavored um notice also that if Theta

982
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,319
upper bar and Theta lower bar are too

983
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,960
close together uh this doesn't work and

984
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,280
firm L just has to drop out of the

985
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,280
market you know because right the

986
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,359
equilibrium looks like Theta upper bar

987
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,280
minus 2 Theta lower bar over three as

988
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:59,119
Theta lower bar approaches half of theta

989
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,960
upper bar firm two is just pricing at

990
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,760
cost if firm Theta lower bar was even

991
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,560
closer to Theta upper

992
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,359
bar what you'd get in equilibrium is FML

993
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,440
would just be shut out it would get be

994
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,520
driven down to pricing you know to play

995
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,319
best response would have be pricing

996
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,400
below cost it eventually doesn't price

997
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,559
below cost it can't compete in the

998
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,359
market okay so vertical differentiation

999
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,640
like horizontal

1000
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:27,240
differentiation produces finite demand

1001
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,960
elasticities it can it can sort of give

1002
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:35,440
plus uh again um you know sort of

1003
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:39,559
standard Coro like markups it doesn't

1004
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,040
give us a model where Coro is um it's

1005
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:44,119
like you know Coro have that continuity

1006
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,640
end goes to Infinity price heads to cost

1007
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,160
here this doesn't happen because there's

1008
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,640
only room for a finite number of firms

1009
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,960
you get the you know like you start

1010
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,599
taking this space you tried to have

1011
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,200
three or four or five or 10 different

1012
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,000
firms selling to this at some point the

1013
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,000
firms get too close together the firms

1014
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,640
that are are below just get shut out of

1015
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,880
the market and can't compete and so it's

1016
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,319
only the high quality firms that are

1017
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,880
making any sales and so there's some you

1018
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,640
know some minimum level of markups

1019
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,400
you're going to have to get there um

1020
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,160
although obviously with um you know as

1021
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,160
firms crowd the space the difference

1022
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,520
between the sh firm and the sh minus

1023
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,960
Epsilon firm you're only going to get

1024
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,920
Epsilon profits but you're still just

1025
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,680
you're going to get it with just a few

1026
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,040
firms

1027
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,480
active

1028
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,640
Okay okay and obviously I I think you

1029
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,800
know modern IO reality we think that

1030
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,480
vertical differentiation and horizontal

1031
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,240
differentiation are present in most

1032
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,480
markets we think most Pro most products

1033
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,880
there's sort of some compon extent to

1034
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,880
which we think product a is better than

1035
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,160
product B that everyone would agree on

1036
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,280
or almost everyone would agree on and

1037
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,720
then there's other horizontal aspect you

1038
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,079
know like everyone wants a phone that

1039
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,280
has better battery life and a better

1040
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:50,400
screen resolution and a better camera

1041
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,119
but then there are other things of

1042
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,760
people like the look and feel of a

1043
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:55,000
versus B and are going to have you know

1044
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,319
know the operate like the operating

1045
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,640
system of a versus B and are going to

1046
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,640
have horizontal and vertical

1047
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,720
tastes okay um so let me go back to

1048
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,640
horizontal differentiation now and this

1049
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,400
is sort of motivated by how the

1050
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,599
empirical literature and iio has

1051
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,400
developed

1052
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:23,599
so generally like you know the standard

1053
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:26,680
you know hoteling is a very nice model

1054
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,599
um of competition on a line hotelling is

1055
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,960
not as good a model once you have three

1056
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,119
firms instead of two firms because you

1057
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,760
have three firms you have to think about

1058
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,160
where do we put the three firms in

1059
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,839
product space you know one thing you

1060
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:43,319
could do is um what I do with my Eraser

1061
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,400
um there it is um you know you could uh

1062
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,359
if you're someone who likes high school

1063
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,960
geometry you know you could go back to

1064
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:51,640
your Youth and say okay here's what I'm

1065
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,760
going to do I'm going to have the three

1066
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:58,680
firm hoteling model and I have firm one

1067
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,559
here firm two here firm three three here

1068
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,000
uh and you know there's going to be a

1069
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,960
set of consumers who are indifferent

1070
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,160
between firm one and firm two based on

1071
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,240
their prices and a set of firms

1072
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,920
indifferent between firm one and three

1073
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,599
based on their prices and a set of firms

1074
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,319
indifferent between

1075
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:20,240
firm uh one and two based on their

1076
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:22,839
prices uh I think that has to go through

1077
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,119
the same point um and so we're going to

1078
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,119
get these sort of three different

1079
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,119
regions

1080
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:33,720
so you know an equilibrium these guys

1081
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,520
buy from one these guys buy from

1082
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,440
two uh and these guys buy from firm

1083
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,559
three I'm going to sort of use

1084
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,960
everything I remember from high school

1085
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:42,160
geometry to figure out the areas of

1086
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,319
those things how the areas of those

1087
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,640
things are functions of P1 and P2 and P3

1088
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:48,359
and then you know when I get to four I'm

1089
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,240
going to make it a tetrahedron and I'm

1090
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:52,440
going to draw all the volumes of those

1091
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,880
things but it's it quickly becomes just

1092
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,119
sort of a intractable mess with lots of

1093
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,680
corners and you also sort of think why

1094
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,040
were we doing this in the first place it

1095
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,640
wasn't like we felt that people were

1096
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,160
uniformally like uniformally distributed

1097
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,000
on the beach seemed okay once you get

1098
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,400
between you know competition between you

1099
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,160
know Google and Samsung and Apple to

1100
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,319
sell Modern phones is it really uniform

1101
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,520
on a triangle why do we believe that

1102
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:20,720
anyway um so what people do instead is

1103
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,200
they've switched to this kind of um

1104
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,839
utility Spectrum where you know in some

1105
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,040
sense what hoteling was trying to do was

1106
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:29,400
switch fit two firms into a one one

1107
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,319
dimensional space and fitting two firms

1108
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,160
into a one-dimensional space was a great

1109
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:37,119
idea to make it more tractable fitting

1110
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,720
three firms into a two-dimensional

1111
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,079
space you know it just gets awkward and

1112
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,800
so the qu observation is why not just

1113
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,280
stick with an end dimensional space for

1114
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,800
n firms instead of an N minus uh

1115
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,480
onedimensional space for n firms and so

1116
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,319
what people do is assume the utility

1117
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,720
that firm I gets from buy utility that

1118
00:46:53,319 --> 00:47:00,000
consumer I gets buying from firm J is PJ

1119
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,040
which is like the vertical quality of

1120
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,440
product

1121
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:09,640
J minus Alpha * PJ the price of firm J

1122
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,400
plus Epsilon i j that's my uniform taste

1123
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,880
for how much I like iPhones or how much

1124
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,319
I like Samsung phones or how much I like

1125
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,920
Google pixel phones okay so we get this

1126
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,680
sort of uh and then people typically

1127
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,520
also actually with n firms will now

1128
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,040
typically go to n plus one dimensional

1129
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,880
uncertainty and they'll add Epsilon i z

1130
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,160
which is how much do I the outside good

1131
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,839
of not purchasing anything so that could

1132
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,400
be you know how much s sentimental value

1133
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:37,040
do I have for my current phone um which

1134
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,480
is often the outside good is just not

1135
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,880
buying anything and keeping the phone

1136
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,920
that I've already got okay and you know

1137
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,359
people can have different so in some

1138
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,960
sense I've got in that phone example

1139
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,680
I've got a four-dimensional preference

1140
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,920
space how much do I like new iPhones how

1141
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,720
much I like new Samsung phones how much

1142
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,400
do I like new pixel phones and how much

1143
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,079
do I like the old phone that's already

1144
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,319
in my pocket okay and you know the

1145
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:59,559
people can have different views about

1146
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,040
these things both for Taste based

1147
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:02,880
reasons and like the one my pocket is

1148
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,400
broken or not broken or whatever

1149
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,720
Condition it's

1150
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,319
in okay you know demand in this model in

1151
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,720
general case it's just an N plus

1152
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:13,839
onedimensional integral to figure out

1153
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,800
the demand for product J when these are

1154
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:20,000
the prices I just integrate over that n

1155
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,839
plus one dimensional space it's just the

1156
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,559
integral over the subset of that space

1157
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:27,599
where product J gives higher utility

1158
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,680
than product k for all K different from

1159
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,480
J and I'm just integrating the density

1160
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,200
of the joint distribution of types over

1161
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,359
that region so you know it's like here

1162
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,839
I'm integrating the density of types to

1163
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,920
find demand for good one in this

1164
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,800
two-dimensional space I just integrate

1165
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,319
the density over this particular region

1166
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,040
of space and so I'm still integrating

1167
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:52,960
over these regions of space that look

1168
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,319
kind of like that um actually you know

1169
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,119
like right the two-dimensional model

1170
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,160
here let me do two products and no

1171
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:03,599
outside good would just be like I've got

1172
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:07,000
uh Epsilon i1 on this axis Epsilon I2 on

1173
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:09,760
this axis um and I would just be you

1174
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,040
know this region so these people buy

1175
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,040
from good one these people buy good two

1176
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,319
it's just entirely as Epsilon I2 greater

1177
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,319
than Epsilon i1 so it's an easier

1178
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:20,799
integral to do typically than those ones

1179
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:22,640
with the things stuck into a lower

1180
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:25,520
dimensional space because you're just

1181
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,390
integrating over quadrants uh or half

1182
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,960
spaces

1183
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:32,960
[Music]

1184
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,960
um

1185
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,319
um you know sometimes in empirical

1186
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,280
papers if people want to do this they're

1187
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,960
just sort of simulating a bunch of

1188
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,280
drawing a bunch of epsilons at random

1189
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,319
figuring out how many of those consumers

1190
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:48,680
buy each product that's how you sort of

1191
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:51,480
do this practically speaking um you know

1192
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,440
this model is sort of tractable in the

1193
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,880
special case when there's no outside

1194
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:00,119
Goods uh the v's are all equal and the

1195
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,319
epsilons are IID with some density F you

1196
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,680
know in general

1197
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,440
um right you know you're trying to solve

1198
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,920
a game an N player game you have to

1199
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,119
solve an n n equations and N unknowns

1200
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,400
problem but if you have looking for a

1201
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,480
symmetric

1202
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,960
equilibrium then you're back to sort of

1203
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,319
a one equation in one unknown problem

1204
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,440
because you have a one unknown equation

1205
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,960
in one unknown problem I'm just trying

1206
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,079
to Max you know I'm so fact that um you

1207
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,960
know when is there an equilibrium of a

1208
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,160
symmetric model where all the firms set

1209
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,720
price P

1210
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,000
star you know that's going to be if P

1211
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:43,680
star belongs to the

1212
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:47,599
argmax over P of profit of firm uh

1213
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:52,119
J uh when it sets price

1214
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,119
PJ and the other firm set price P

1215
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,799
Star right so sorry if I make it

1216
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:01,280
symmetric so this profit it doesn't

1217
00:50:57,799 --> 00:51:03,920
depend on J this is just one equation in

1218
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,359
one unknown that lets me find P star

1219
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,280
it's just each firm is maximizing its

1220
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:12,880
profit holding everybody else's profits

1221
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:14,920
at P star and so you know where

1222
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,720
asymmetric models are an N equation

1223
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,359
problem one equation symmetric

1224
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,079
equilibria you can often find by just

1225
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,799
solving one equation and one unknown and

1226
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,240
so people often do that to give

1227
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:28,680
insights um so let's look at what is the

1228
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:34,960
you know and obviously the pi

1229
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:37,200
J Pi of PJ comma P star is going to be

1230
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,480
XJ

1231
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,720
of uh PJ comma P

1232
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:48,839
star uh

1233
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:52,640
times PJ minus C right so your demand is

1234
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,799
just price Minus cost times demand like

1235
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:59,640
it was in all the other

1236
00:51:54,799 --> 00:52:02,760
models uh what is demand look like

1237
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,880
um okay um so if I'm thinking about

1238
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,359
every other firm is charging Price p or

1239
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,319
P star and I'm considering charging my

1240
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,240
price

1241
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,040
PJ when when is someone going to buy

1242
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,720
from

1243
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:18,680
me um they're going to buy from me if um

1244
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:22,520
their preference for me so they're going

1245
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,799
to buy from me if Epsilon i

1246
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,240
j is at

1247
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:31,599
least the maximum

1248
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:33,520
um K different from J Epsilon i

1249
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:37,359
k

1250
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,520
plus PJ minus P

1251
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:43,160
Star right if everyone else is charging

1252
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,799
P star and I charge PJ which is greater

1253
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,079
than P star I have to be that much they

1254
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:50,240
have to have that much higher

1255
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,799
idiosyncratic preference for me than

1256
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,599
they have for anybody else and if I

1257
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:56,040
charge a lower price they can be this

1258
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:59,079
much lower than their best preference

1259
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:03,359
for everybody else and still buy from me

1260
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:06,280
so what you get is the demand for me is

1261
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,240
this is let's suppose that their you

1262
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,559
know suppose that this I'm going to call

1263
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,680
Theta their greatest utility they get

1264
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,400
from buying from any other firm or

1265
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,319
greatest idiosyncratic taste for any

1266
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,960
other

1267
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:23,119
firm then they're going to buy from me

1268
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:27,079
this is the probability that their type

1269
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,559
is bigger than theta plus PJ minus p so

1270
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,359
that's a probability that you know this

1271
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:36,359
is the probability that Epsilon i j is

1272
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:39,799
bigger than theta plus this and then

1273
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:41,119
this is the density of this is the

1274
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,799
density of

1275
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,880
theta right so if you're

1276
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:50,319
choosing um you know if you're thinking

1277
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,760
of that there are n other draws or n

1278
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:56,680
minus one other draws their n minus one

1279
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,359
draws from some distribution f what's

1280
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,599
the probability that the largest of n

1281
00:53:58,359 --> 00:54:04,480
minus1 draws from f is in some tiny

1282
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:07,319
interval theta plus d

1283
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,280
Theta and the probability that this is

1284
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:10,520
it's an order statistic calculation I

1285
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,880
don't know if the order statistics have

1286
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:18,359
disappeared from 380 um but so you know

1287
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:20,119
the density of the highest of n draws so

1288
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:22,119
the probability that someone is in this

1289
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:25,520
the highest of n minus one draws in that

1290
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:29,319
interval is you pick some firm to be the

1291
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:31,079
highest their value your the Epsilon for

1292
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:34,079
them has to be in this interval which

1293
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:36,640
happens with probability F of theta and

1294
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,880
all other epsilons have to be less than

1295
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,480
that Theta which happens with

1296
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,559
probability capital F of theta the N

1297
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:45,799
minus 2 so this is the density for the

1298
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:48,480
highest of the N minus one rival draws

1299
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:51,400
but so anyway this is what that's what

1300
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,400
my demand looks

1301
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,640
like you know if this is what my demand

1302
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:57,599
looks like then again I'm just going to

1303
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,799
have the first order condition that I'm

1304
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:05,319
going to have to have you know PJ you

1305
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:05,319
know P star satisfies the first order

1306
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:14,440
condition uh D Pi J

1307
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:17,599
dpj evaluated PJ equals P

1308
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,079
star equals zero and so I'm going to get

1309
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,599
a first order condition the first order

1310
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:28,319
condition is just going to look like PJ

1311
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:28,319
minus C * dxj dpj plus XJ equals z

1312
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,280
um and so it turns out you can just you

1313
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,400
know if I I should do that right again

1314
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,760
so I have this first order Condition

1315
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,359
it's going to look

1316
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,880
like um P star minus

1317
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:44,680
C time

1318
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,520
dxj

1319
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:51,480
dpj evaluated at P

1320
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,599
Star Plus XJ of P

1321
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,839
star equals

1322
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,920
zero so that's what the first order

1323
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:00,960
condition is going to look like as it

1324
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,599
has always looked in this class and then

1325
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:07,280
the XJ of P star is going to be 1 over n

1326
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:11,359
in equilibrium with n symmetric

1327
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:19,480
firms so you just get P star minus

1328
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:19,480
C is just equal to minus1 over n dxj

1329
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,400
dpj one other thing I meant to mention

1330
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,839
before is um

1331
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,280
you know look at this utility function V

1332
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:35,079
minus alpha x p plus Epsilon utilities

1333
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,440
are only defined up to a uh Aline

1334
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:40,559
transformation I think probably hear

1335
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:45,960
that 121 a lot so you can also think of

1336
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:48,400
this as like V over Alpha minus p + 1/

1337
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,799
Alpha * Epsilon i

1338
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,640
j so this model when people put in a

1339
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:57,319
price coefficient Alpha is a lot like

1340
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,559
the hotelling model where one puts a one

1341
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:02,839
over Alpha where the T used to

1342
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:06,079
be because one over Alpha is like the

1343
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:08,520
size of the transportation cost size of

1344
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:11,880
the heterogeneity relative to having a

1345
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,160
unit coefficient on the price so people

1346
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,599
you know when people do empirical iio

1347
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,839
they always put an alpha here but you

1348
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,400
can think of it as fixing this as one

1349
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:20,240
and putting a one over Alpha in front of

1350
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,280
the

1351
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,760
epsilons okay so anyway so what do you

1352
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,799
get us the mark up when you do this uh

1353
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:32,240
would you get to markup is price so this

1354
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:39,480
is price equals

1355
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:39,480
Cost Plus uh -1 over n one over dxj

1356
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:46,920
dpj so anyway the equilibrium formula is

1357
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:51,200
price equals C + T *

1358
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:53,559
something so it's c plus T * 1 M of N

1359
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,559
and one over M of n is just what you get

1360
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:56,559
differentiating

1361
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,520
you know it's it's the M of n is like

1362
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,280
what you get differentiating this thing

1363
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,839
with respect to

1364
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,720
PJ and you can see it's got things like

1365
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:12,400
f to the N minus 2 and F and n's in it

1366
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,960
and stuff but anyway if you do the

1367
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,079
calculation you differentiate on the

1368
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,760
integral

1369
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:21,160
sign this is what you get so price

1370
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:24,880
equals C + 1 M of n * 1 over

1371
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:26,720
Alpha where M of n depends on the

1372
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,520
assumed density

1373
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,520
of theeta of the distribution of the

1374
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,839
epsilons so some

1375
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:38,720
cories

1376
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:41,400
um suppose f is uniform 01 so you know

1377
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,559
like uh certainly hoteling could have

1378
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,000
done instead of the beach you could have

1379
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:49,520
done the sort of people living on a

1380
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,079
square where this was utility Epsilon i1

1381
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,480
this is Epsilon I2

1382
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,880
okay turns out that if hotelling had

1383
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,119
done his model on a square he would have

1384
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,359
found the neat result that uh price

1385
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,000
equals c plus 12T he would have gotten

1386
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:07,720
exactly the same thing except with 1/2

1387
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,440
in it um but so with the linear model

1388
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,240
you can extend this to you know people

1389
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,359
living on a hyper Cube or cube or a

1390
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:17,440
hyper Cube or whatever and the formula

1391
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:20,240
is exactly correct that price equals C+

1392
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,880
1/ n * T so the thing that everyone

1393
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,480
loved about Corno is true of this

1394
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,440
hypercube model of product

1395
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,440
differentiation

1396
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,000
price is just C plus T where T is sort

1397
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,839
of the length of a side of the cube how

1398
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,039
how intense is your preference for Coke

1399
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:40,079
versus non Coke or whatever and uh

1400
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,039
things decre decline like one over n if

1401
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,039
they're n firms in the

1402
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:49,839
model um what can we say more generally

1403
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,480
going outside the uniform distribution

1404
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,039
um suppose that you know uniform

1405
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,240
distribution is bounded above suppose

1406
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:58,839
that the Epsilon is bounded above or

1407
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,680
that the tails are thin tails are thin

1408
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:02,599
like the normal distribution in this

1409
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:05,599
sense of limit as Epsilon goes to

1410
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:09,720
Infinity F Prime over F goes to negative

1411
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:12,960
Infinity um then as the number of firms

1412
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:16,359
goes up prices drop to cost so if we

1413
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,400
take bounded distributions or we take

1414
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:20,880
distributions that are not bounded but

1415
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,280
have very thin Tails then you do get the

1416
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,079
result that competition drives prices to

1417
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,000
zero um does that happen for all

1418
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,559
distributions the answer is no most

1419
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,720
important example where that doesn't

1420
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,640
happen is the logid error distribution

1421
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,119
which people often assume because it

1422
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,160
makes algebra easier but it turns out

1423
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:43,000
for the logit model so the lit this is

1424
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,760
the logit CDF where you know gamma's the

1425
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,880
oiler mascheroni constant like

1426
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,480
0577 so in the lit model what you

1427
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:57,039
actually get is price equals constant

1428
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:02,079
Cost Plus some constant Time 1 + 1 nus1

1429
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:05,520
* 1 Alpha so as n goes to

1430
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,440
Infinity you know P star is going to C +

1431
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:12,760
one over

1432
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:16,359
Alpha so in the lent model uh prices

1433
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:19,720
what K Alpha oh yes K Over Alpha thank

1434
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:23,960
you um

1435
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:25,720
uh where K is some K it's it's just some

1436
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,880
constant I forget exactly you know like

1437
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,240
you you can think of it's like 2378 I I

1438
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,440
forget what the number is but it's just

1439
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:34,599
it's just a

1440
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:36,000
number so in in the logit model prices

1441
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:38,640
you can compute what it is you know

1442
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,960
prices are just like a C+ you know

1443
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,839
prices as number of firms goes to

1444
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:46,039
Infinity competition doesn't eliminate

1445
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:48,440
markups um and you know how is this

1446
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:50,240
possible you know the idea is that these

1447
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,799
models have a

1448
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:56,720
somewhat unreasonable assumption that I

1449
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:59,640
I snuck over on you which was that you

1450
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,400
know as I said like in two Dimensions

1451
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:04,400
it's like you know how much do I like

1452
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,559
iPhones versus do I like Samsung phones

1453
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,039
it seems like okay it's reasonable to

1454
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:09,520
assume there people those two separate

1455
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:12,760
differ or preferences but what I snuck

1456
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,960
over on you is that um here I said it

1457
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:17,680
epsilons are IID independent and

1458
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,680
identically distributed okay the more

1459
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,520
products you have it gets harder and

1460
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,680
harder to say it's really plausible that

1461
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,440
my taste for a BMW and a Mercedes and a

1462
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,200
whatever are all completely independent

1463
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,240
of each other you know as the number of

1464
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,559
firms gets large the products get

1465
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,640
awfully similar to each other so if

1466
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:35,720
you're a person who likes Mercedes

1467
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,720
styling you probably also like BMW

1468
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,440
styling and if you're one who likes

1469
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:43,079
Toyota you know Lexus styling maybe you

1470
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,319
also like you know Acura styling or

1471
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:47,160
whatever so you know in some sense what

1472
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:49,119
the lent model is assuming if you assume

1473
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,720
we keep having this every new product

1474
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,480
has this completely new idiosyncratic

1475
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,960
reaction to it you know Suppose there

1476
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,599
are a million products out there and you

1477
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,880
tell me okay yeah they're you're one of

1478
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,640
a million products in the market but

1479
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,359
this person likes your product better

1480
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,720
than every other product well you know

1481
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:08,839
to think about you know right the

1482
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:10,799
markups depend on what this dxj dpj what

1483
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:13,039
do I conclude

1484
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,640
when I've just been told they like my

1485
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,520
product more than everybody else's

1486
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,279
product I'm like wow they like my

1487
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:23,240
product a lot okay now in

1488
01:03:19,279 --> 01:03:26,119
the hyper Cube model if you know like if

1489
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,599
the Epsilon i j is you know is is

1490
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:31,039
distributed uniform

1491
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:33,400
01 I'm like they like me best out of a

1492
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,799
million things it must be my utility for

1493
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,640
me is like

1494
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:39,760
999999 something or other or they

1495
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,240
wouldn't have been buying from me but if

1496
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,440
while they like me this much there's

1497
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:47,760
also somebody else who they like

1498
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,160
999998 or something and so I I think the

1499
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,640
amount by which they like my product

1500
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,480
over anybody else's product is Tiny

1501
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,119
therefore I'm going to have my demand is

1502
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,799
very price sensitive and if I don't

1503
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,960
price really low they're going to switch

1504
01:03:57,799 --> 01:04:02,240
so I have this incredibly price

1505
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,440
sensitive demand but if you have like a

1506
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,359
you know maybe you know this if you have

1507
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,319
an exponential

1508
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:09,920
distribution and you're told that you're

1509
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:12,400
the largest of n exponentials how far

1510
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,200
are you above the next highest draw um

1511
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,000
the answer is one that's sort of a

1512
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,359
property of the exponential distribution

1513
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,119
that if you're the highest of n draws

1514
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:23,079
from the EXP un standard exponential

1515
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,160
expect your your posterior for their

1516
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:26,319
value for youu is n and your posterior

1517
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,880
for their product their value for the

1518
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:30,079
next highest one is is has high

1519
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,839
expectation n minus one so you think you

1520
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:36,319
have like one of of uh you know space to

1521
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,880
price relative to your rival and so like

1522
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:39,720
with an exponential distribution we

1523
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,839
actually get the you know you get

1524
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,640
exponential distribution you're going to

1525
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:46,400
get like you know P star equals c plus T

1526
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,799
doesn't depend on N at all the the more

1527
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,279
exponential draws there are out there

1528
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:50,760
they're just Yep they're probably like

1529
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:52,440
me a lot more than somebody else you

1530
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,960
know they like me they like me a million

1531
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:58,200
they like the next guy 999,999

1532
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,520
lit isn't quite like the exponential but

1533
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,480
it turns out to be just very similar to

1534
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:04,880
the exponential and that

1535
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,599
approximately um it ends up with an

1536
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,279
approximately constant

1537
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,359
markup and that markup depends on what

1538
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:14,400
weight you stick in front of the Epsilon

1539
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:18,200
i j in the in the logit model the one

1540
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,039
over Alpha okay um and you know there

1541
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,720
are distributions for which if you take

1542
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:23,119
a really fat tailed distribution one

1543
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,440
that's fatter tailed than the

1544
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,160
exponential prices can go up as n goes

1545
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,599
to

1546
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,119
infinity and again you know I don't I

1547
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:32,839
don't know that we think that's often

1548
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:35,559
realistic like where do these you keep

1549
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:37,839
getting these independent taste from but

1550
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:41,039
you know it's you know in these models

1551
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,039
it's there you should be aware of

1552
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,359
it questions on that so okay I think

1553
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,119
that's what I had to say oh yeah I so I

1554
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:53,200
think I'm going to skip this slide um

1555
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,359
the one thing I wanted to say in this

1556
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,760
slide is you know suppose you know

1557
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,680
student comes to me and says I want to

1558
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,359
write a paper about mergers and the

1559
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,279
effect of Mer mergers are having on

1560
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:06,880
markups in Industry X um this is sort of

1561
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:08,240
a you know know your theory cautionary

1562
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,160
tale if you know student says okay I'm

1563
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,119
going to estimate demand logit demand in

1564
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,960
this model and see what's happened when

1565
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,599
you merge from five firms down to four

1566
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:20,319
firms if you know phone maker a buys

1567
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:21,400
phone maker b or whatever and you know

1568
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,520
you know so you can sort of estimate

1569
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,440
your loin model and say I'm going to

1570
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:27,920
allow the price sensitivity to vary and

1571
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:30,440
have it be you know V us uh V minus

1572
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,359
Alpha P plus Epsilon utility and I'm

1573
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,960
going to estimate the alpha and see how

1574
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:35,119
price sensitive things are and then when

1575
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,279
I found out how price ensor things are

1576
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,599
see what the merger is going to do you

1577
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:42,079
know what if you then use that model

1578
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:44,279
let's say when you go from five to four

1579
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:47,119
firms how do markups go up me the answer

1580
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:50,720
is markups go up by 1.06 7 you know with

1581
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:53,599
five symmetric firms the markup is C

1582
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:57,359
plus k thing times 54s when you go to

1583
01:06:53,599 --> 01:07:00,960
four firms it's c plus K Over Alpha time

1584
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:02,920
4/3 so on the question of how to markups

1585
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,520
change when you go from four firms to

1586
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:09,279
three fir five firms to four firms um

1587
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,720
you know the answer is the that question

1588
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:12,039
has an answer that's independent of the

1589
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,200
all the parameters you estimate in the

1590
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:17,319
model and the answer is just this and so

1591
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,720
you know if you do want

1592
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:23,520
to estimate how mergers would affect

1593
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,160
markups in models with horizontal

1594
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,799
differentiation you know you have to

1595
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:31,880
make sure sure you're correctly

1596
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:35,400
estimating you know this object dxj dxj

1597
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:38,400
DPI versus dxi DPI um and the sort of

1598
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,839
you know the models like the logit model

1599
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,960
kind of built in assumptions about what

1600
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,599
those things are and you know if these

1601
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,160
things both just have an alpha in them

1602
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,240
and those Alphas

1603
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:50,200
cancel you you're not actually

1604
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,200
estimating what you think you're

1605
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:56,599
estimating but I didn't want to take

1606
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:59,160
time on that okay so um uh

1607
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:02,200
going to more modern pictures I Stu

1608
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:04,160
jong's picture on this slide so um

1609
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:07,799
discuss you know recent

1610
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:11,880
paper um discussing the effects of uh

1611
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:14,110
bundling on competition um so the

1612
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,640
motivation for this paper is

1613
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:19,920
[Music]

1614
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:21,640
um you know there are many firms where

1615
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,319
there is sort of this antitrust concern

1616
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,120
about firms bundling and selling their

1617
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,839
products together instead of selling

1618
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:31,640
their product separately um so you know

1619
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:32,880
firms for instance if you're U maybe you

1620
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,400
think they don't really matter but like

1621
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,719
you know apple is selling phones and

1622
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,759
they're selling

1623
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,080
earbuds uh and you can sort of think of

1624
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:41,600
like I can design the phones and the

1625
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,679
earbuds so they only work together and

1626
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,239
have to be bought as a bundle or I can

1627
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,799
design the phones and earbuds so they

1628
01:08:45,239 --> 01:08:49,520
work separately and I can be competing

1629
01:08:47,799 --> 01:08:50,960
with Samsung separately in the phone

1630
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,960
market and separately in the earbud

1631
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,440
Market um you know with operating

1632
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,080
systems this often comes up is like what

1633
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,600
features do I build into an operating

1634
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,400
system so that people have to buy the

1635
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,239
bundle of the operating system

1636
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,319
containing these 37 different components

1637
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,880
all from me or do I allow sort of

1638
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,480
plug-and-play compatibility so we have

1639
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:13,159
separate competition product by product

1640
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:15,000
okay okay and so you know um this is a

1641
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:16,679
potential antitrust remedy in for in

1642
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,600
Industries with large Market power is

1643
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:22,000
forcing them to be compatible uh you

1644
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,319
know and not use proprietary connectors

1645
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,920
or whatever um to extend their

1646
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,279
monopolies and so

1647
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,839
you know Joe's papers about this

1648
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:32,719
question of will when will markups you

1649
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:34,239
know will bundling products together

1650
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,839
make markups higher will it make it

1651
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:36,880
markups lower how will it affect

1652
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,440
consumer

1653
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:43,759
utility so in his

1654
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:47,040
model um you have these uh n firms and

1655
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:49,239
the N firms all sell M distinct

1656
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,719
products and he looks at utilities of

1657
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:58,480
the following form you get utility V

1658
01:09:52,719 --> 01:10:03,040
minus pjm plus Epsilon J M if you buy um

1659
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:05,000
product J uh if you buy sorry product M

1660
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:09,199
from firm

1661
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,880
J and he Compares two separate models uh

1662
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:14,080
one model is

1663
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,159
where the firms compete separately in

1664
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:21,960
this whole Matrix of prices so you know

1665
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:25,800
firm one sets prices P11 p12 up to

1666
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,480
p1m and then firm two sets prices p21 up

1667
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,040
to

1668
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,560
p2m and then firm three I'll just have

1669
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,480
three firms Post Its bundle of prices

1670
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:37,320
p3m he Compares that to a bundled system

1671
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,440
where the firms just design their

1672
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:45,040
products to be all mutually incompatible

1673
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:48,719
so firm one just sets a price uh Capital

1674
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,640
P1 firm two sets price Capital P2 and

1675
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,800
firm three sets a price Capital P3 for

1676
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,679
the bundle so this is the bundle of

1677
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,840
getting all of these goods from me this

1678
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:57,600
is the bundle of getting all these

1679
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,800
things from firm two and this is the

1680
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,520
bundle of getting all these things from

1681
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,679
firm three and he thinks about which

1682
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,640
results in Greater consumer welfare in

1683
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:10,760
Greater profits having unbundled pricing

1684
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,760
uh or having bundled

1685
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:18,960
pricing okay first observation is you

1686
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:23,080
know when do consumers prefer buying

1687
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:26,840
bundle one from bundle two well that's

1688
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:29,000
if M * V minus the price of the bundle

1689
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,440
plus the sum across all products within

1690
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,159
the bundle of

1691
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:36,320
epsilonm is better than buying MV minus

1692
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:38,040
the price of bundle K times the sum

1693
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,280
overall things in the bundle of Epsilon

1694
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,400
I

1695
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,320
km and again normalizing this by

1696
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:47,440
dividing by the number of firms so if I

1697
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:50,920
convert this to like a you know this is

1698
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:55,199
M products so P1 over M I'm going to

1699
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:55,199
think of as the per product price

1700
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,080
you know this is what's sort of going to

1701
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,239
be equivalent to sort of P11 or

1702
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,840
something it's you know how much are I

1703
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:05,159
charging per product in the

1704
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:08,760
bundle so I like this one better if and

1705
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:12,840
only if um V

1706
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:16,080
minus V minus one over M PJ plus 1 / M

1707
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:19,719
the sum of Epsilon I JM is bigger than

1708
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:22,920
this so basically bundling is like

1709
01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:28,159
converting the model where you have

1710
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:31,880
utilities Epsilon i1 up to

1711
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:36,520
Epsilon N1 into a model where you

1712
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:40,320
have 1 over M sum of Epsilon i1 and 1

1713
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:42,320
over M sum of Epsilon I IM right you're

1714
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:45,239
just basically converting comparing the

1715
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,040
model with utilities from the original

1716
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:49,600
draw random draws from the original

1717
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,719
distribution to the model with utilities

1718
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,639
that are random draws from this

1719
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:55,760
distribution so that's what I do when I

1720
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:57,960
bundle is I just change the distri of in

1721
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,760
sycratic consumer preferences and make

1722
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:03,960
it an average of these okay and

1723
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,760
obviously right the um uh Central limit

1724
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,480
theorem is going to tell us that as M

1725
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,719
goes to Infinity you know these things

1726
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,400
are going to be have smaller this is

1727
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,120
going to have smaller variance than that

1728
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,639
and it's going to look approximately

1729
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,320
normal as M goes to Infinity but normal

1730
01:13:15,639 --> 01:13:20,600
with a smaller variance than the first

1731
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:23,520
one had

1732
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:27,040
um okay so let's think about whether

1733
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,679
prices are higher again same price first

1734
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,679
order condition I've done over and over

1735
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:34,960
again so first order condition for for

1736
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:37,719
uh price competition is PJ minus C *

1737
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,000
minus dxj dpj equals

1738
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:42,560
XJ and again if I'm looking for a

1739
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,320
symmetric equilibrium of this model this

1740
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:50,440
is going to be P star minus C time minus

1741
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,440
dxj dpj equal 1/

1742
01:13:51,320 --> 01:14:00,120
n and what is dxj dpj going to be

1743
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:03,560
dxj dpj is just the density of consumers

1744
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:05,440
who have utility for me equal to the

1745
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,760
maximum of their utility their

1746
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,040
idiosyncratic reaction to me equal to

1747
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,040
the maximum of their idiosyncratic

1748
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:15,320
reaction to everybody

1749
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,320
else and so

1750
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:22,400
um you know so fixing n right this first

1751
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:24,800
order condition right we I don't have it

1752
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,520
written down anymore um so right my

1753
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:32,960
first sort of condition

1754
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:34,880
was uh you know P star = c - 1 / n * 1 /

1755
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:38,760
dxj

1756
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:40,960
dpj or actually I do this

1757
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:43,960
okay that's sort of what my first order

1758
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:47,000
conditions always keep looking like so

1759
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:48,639
equilibrium prices are low if this

1760
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,800
density is high and equilibrium prices

1761
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:54,639
are high if this density is low so in

1762
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,199
this you know dxj dpj is the density of

1763
01:14:54,639 --> 01:14:58,719
the

1764
01:14:56,199 --> 01:15:00,639
set of consumers who have my Epsilon

1765
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:03,400
just about everybody else's

1766
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:05,040
Epsilon um notice that right the

1767
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,880
distribution of the sort of sum of the

1768
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,159
epsilons it's more concentrated about

1769
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,159
its mean it's thinner in the

1770
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:19,000
Tails okay so consumer surplus in this

1771
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:21,600
model depends on there sort of two main

1772
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,520
welfare effects for consumers one is

1773
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:27,239
price levels consumers like low prices

1774
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,480
um and and there's less dead weight loss

1775
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:32,600
when prices are low um the other thing

1776
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:34,280
that welfare depends on is match quality

1777
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,960
consumers are better if they're getting

1778
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,120
their favorite phone and their favorite

1779
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:41,719
earbuds and their favorite charger than

1780
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,080
if they're getting their favored of one

1781
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:45,520
and their second favor of the other and

1782
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,400
their third favored of another so the

1783
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,440
match quality is our consumers getting

1784
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,600
what's the best product for them on on

1785
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,360
every

1786
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,639
subcomponent uh and then there's the

1787
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:57,800
price level thing that they care about

1788
01:15:55,639 --> 01:16:00,760
okay so uh what's the result so first

1789
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:03,320
result on the paper is that bundling

1790
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:06,000
reduces per good prices when an equals

1791
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:08,560
two so if you you have a firm if you

1792
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,280
have two firms um and they bundle their

1793
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,239
goods together equilibrium price per

1794
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,480
product prices go

1795
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:18,360
down

1796
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:20,639
um noting you know prices go down mean

1797
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:22,280
that the firms make less

1798
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:24,960
profit

1799
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:26,360
um and why is that you know the answer

1800
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,239
answer is

1801
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:32,360
that you know that density of 1 over M

1802
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:35,480
Epsilon becomes more

1803
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:37,159
concentrated when n equals 2 what we

1804
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,400
have is just what's the probability that

1805
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:42,600
ui1 minus ui2 is less than Delta and

1806
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,600
that's just the probability that we're

1807
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,760
close to the 45 degree line that is that

1808
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,120
my my Epsilon for firm one is close to

1809
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:53,560
my is within Epsilon of my sorry within

1810
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,000
let's say this is you know small Delta

1811
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,320
what's the probability that my

1812
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,360
preference for firm one my preference

1813
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,360
for firm two are within Delta well if

1814
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:03,920
you take the distribution of tastes that

1815
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:05,120
used to be like uniform and you sort of

1816
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,760
you know like in the uniform

1817
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,400
distribution this thing is not all that

1818
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,040
big but then like you sort of add end

1819
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,840
Goods you make this thing distribution

1820
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,639
look like this almost everybody has a

1821
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,960
preference of exactly a half for both

1822
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:18,280
products then once they have utility of

1823
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,520
exactly a half for both products they

1824
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:22,679
have a huge probability they're within

1825
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,400
some tiny Delta of each other therefore

1826
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:29,360
price competition becomes very intense

1827
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:32,679
so when n equals 2 it turns out that you

1828
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,440
know whatever m is bundling just always

1829
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:36,880
makes the prices

1830
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,880
lower so you know some sense firms

1831
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:44,679
should not want to bundle uh in in a two

1832
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:46,159
firm model okay um what's noteworthy

1833
01:17:44,679 --> 01:17:48,320
though is while the firms don't want to

1834
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:51,440
bundle the consumers also don't want the

1835
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,520
firms to bundle so the prices go down

1836
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,719
but the consumers are worse off and

1837
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,159
that's because the

1838
01:17:55,719 --> 01:18:01,520
worse match quality overwhelms the price

1839
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:02,920
drop so there's a price drop uh but it

1840
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,400
also makes the consumers worse off

1841
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,440
because they get worse match quality and

1842
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,760
it doesn't compensate the and the price

1843
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:11,040
drop isn't big enough to compensate them

1844
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,560
for the drop and match quality

1845
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,480
um

1846
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,920
now when n equals 2 that's true when n

1847
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:21,400
is large when n is above some

1848
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:24,360
threshold um bundling starts to increase

1849
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:26,880
profits and why is that well you know

1850
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:30,600
again the sort of value this sort of sum

1851
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,960
of epsilonm starts getting to be a very

1852
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:35,360
tight

1853
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:38,760
distribution and so what's the density

1854
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:42,120
of consumers who have very close values

1855
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:45,440
for the best and second best thing

1856
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:47,040
that's a density measured out here you

1857
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,400
know if you like me best what's the

1858
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,560
probably you like someone else what's

1859
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:55,840
the sort of probably the other person as

1860
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:58,840
close to you um as

1861
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,120
when n gets large you know holding n

1862
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,040
yeah holding M fixed letting n Go Large

1863
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:07,159
looking further out in that distribution

1864
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:09,480
it gets thinner tailed and the dxj dpj

1865
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:12,120
is small and therefore the P star is

1866
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,480
high so bundling is good when the number

1867
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,639
of firms is

1868
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:17,960
large um and a third result is when you

1869
01:19:16,639 --> 01:19:21,560
fix the number of firms and the number

1870
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:23,639
of goods goes to Infinity then you know

1871
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,840
increasing then bundling eventually you

1872
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:28,320
know bundling drives prices to zero as m

1873
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,320
is going to

1874
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,199
Infinity so I think it's just it's a

1875
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,560
some ways that I wanted to do it because

1876
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,560
I want to sort of cover some reent paper

1877
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,440
and it's a nice example of

1878
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:43,639
how that basic Pearl off salop intuition

1879
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,560
of price is about differentiation and

1880
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:48,679
it's about dxj

1881
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,400
dpj is a very good way to think about a

1882
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:54,800
lot it's a good way to think about a lot

1883
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,800
of issues sort of bundling included

1884
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:02,199
I don't understand why four like is a

1885
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:10,520
result so because we're just

1886
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:12,679
like putting Infinity in the

1887
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:15,520
denominator would they ever charge like

1888
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:19,080
an INF price sorry um oh I should have

1889
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:22,679
said sorry I should have said uh this is

1890
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:25,480
um that's with C C equals zero so it's

1891
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:28,239
going to be that um I I think I had a C

1892
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:29,880
equals z assumption so it's the yeah

1893
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,440
limit is it probably should have written

1894
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,920
limit as M goes to

1895
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,920
Infinity uh

1896
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:40,920
PB over M minus C goes to

1897
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,120
zero I think maybe I had C equals z

1898
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,639
throughout the paper

1899
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:54,040
um

1900
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:55,639
yeah okay okay uh let me end there then

1901
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:58,159
I have uh I didn't think I would get to

1902
01:20:55,639 --> 01:21:00,840
these last slides but um so anyway on

1903
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:02,719
Monday what I'm going to do is um

1904
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,440
discuss oligopoly price

1905
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,800
discrimination um where you know you

1906
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:08,000
have oligopolies who are competing to

1907
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,920
sell multiple products and therefore are

1908
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,239
going to be price discriminating in

1909
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,080
selling multip products and then I'm

1910
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:14,400
going to do two empirical papers uh

1911
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:17,360
breast andan and Miller Weinberg uh

1912
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,760
breast andan you know I took the star

1913
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,239
off it this year because you know breast

1914
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:23,600
andan is it's the original it's a real

1915
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:25,199
classic you know it really looks 50

1916
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,000
years 40 years old when you read it and

1917
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:28,840
you're like wow I can't believe you do

1918
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,320
things that way but it's so I'll just

1919
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,679
I'll discuss the ideas in breast and

1920
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,440
hand not going into the details which

1921
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:36,520
now look very oldfashioned and then I'll

1922
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,639
sort of discuss Miller Weinberg and I'm

1923
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,280
part I'm doing less empirical work here

1924
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,280
because tobas is talking about demand

1925
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:43,679
estimation here and an awful lot of

1926
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,880
demand estimation is really about

1927
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:48,199
estimating static models of product

1928
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:53,520
competition with those Epsilon i j kinds

1929
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:57,560
of models that uh I talked about

1930
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,560
okay e
