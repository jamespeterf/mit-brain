00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,279
hi everybody our first thing that we

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,480
really want to think about is how are we

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,080
going to

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,320
represent

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,439
musical objects

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,560
music on a computer so let's start with

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,720
maybe one of the most fundamental things

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,640
and that is pitch so

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,120
in a score-based class we might

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,600
represent pitch with a score and we

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,960
write notes on

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,640
it I guess then we assign it to a

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,840
variable well that's not going to work

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,239
um okay so we we take a a frequency and

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,399
we assign that to a variable well I'm

16
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:01,079
not exactly sure how to do that either

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,199
um maybe we just assign a variable to a

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,720
particular number representing a

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,280
frequency or to a

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,479
string representing a

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,159
pitch

22
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:18,840
okay first thing I want you to do is

23
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:23,600
take five minutes no more than that and

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,840
jot down some notes on how you like

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,840
represent pitch on a computer very

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,840
naively
