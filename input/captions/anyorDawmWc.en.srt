1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,599
okay let's get started let's get this

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,640
world world we're moving on uh this is

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,439
week four so we're on topic four they're

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
not always going to line up so neatly

5
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,480
with a week but as long as we can do it

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,080
just makes the mind a little better and

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,160
week four is about equality equivalence

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,800
in intervals

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,520
um so uh first thing

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,200
first any questions on problem set three

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,320
those who have started working on

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,320
it yeah one of the

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,039
scores was behaved weird when I was yeah

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,480
anyone else see anything weird about

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,039
10.7 did you show the score um yeah I

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,520
showed the score I counted the number of

17
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,359
notes and then I actually

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,320
like or maybe I'm not thinking of 10.7

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,480
then if if it didn't immediately got

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280
like three times as many notes when I

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,720
did score analysis but it didn't have it

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,200
on any the pieces but I actually

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,159
physically counted them my hand

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,520
interesting look look at that one show

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,799
doesn't show the entire score yeah show

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,040
doesn't yeah show doesn't show the

27
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,560
entire score in Jupiter uh that's a

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,680
feature um thank you for for reminding

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
me that's a feature in um in Version 9

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,479
which was supposed to be released before

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,320
the beginning of class but we found bugs

32
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,439
in that where you'll be able to look at

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,680
the other Parts yeah yeah 10.9 is a

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,479
longer uh one of the longer scores thank

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,720
you thank you one of the other scores

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,960
has something uh a little bit different

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,479
to about it that's worth looking at cool

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,880
um yeah yeah so uh especially if you

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,560
don't um if it doesn't seem to conclude

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,119
with a a nice authentic Cadence or

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,439
something like that then probably not

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,719
and actually for anybody um nice I don't

43
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,240
have any prizes I didn't bring any um

44
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,479
Candy or anything say 66.6 one we're

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,719
working on does it end with an authentic

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,479
Cadence or something else that'll be an

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,120
interesting point when we get around to

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,440
automatic Roman numeral analysis uh

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,319
which we will get to later that that the

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,239
preview I think that's P set seven it

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,000
might be P set eight that's the other

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,560
one uh and I'll give you some notice in

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,200
advance that's the other pet that um

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,040
that takes a little bit more time though

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,920
that one's uh you have a group for that

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,360
okay um great uh you all watched I can I

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,480
can see most people are doing very good

58
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,760
job of keeping up with videos and things

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,920
uh this weekend by the way you won't

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,239
have any um you all need a break from

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,879
that definitely um but uh most people

62
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,800
keep me up with videos anything about

63
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,040
the sound discore the thing I had hop to

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,200
get into class but that we instead uh

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,200
watch me not blabber live but blabber on

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,800
video um anything about that there were

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,760
some really cool uh other examples

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,159
anybody want to share theirs U on there

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,319
that one that one I did give sometimes

70
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,599
just one to two words feedback but what

71
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,440
what were some of the things that you

72
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,000
could

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,400
use what are some of the steps do you

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,200
remember in going from um an audio file

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,840
to audio to uh score what was some of

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,360
the things you needed to

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,239
do frequency analysis what's that

78
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,239
frequency analysis good good more toward

79
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,439
the end the beginning toward the

80
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,879
beginning okay so somewhere over here

81
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,920
with frequency analysis

82
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,720
y pitch connections what what did we

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,640
mean by that just I guess that's

84
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,400
technically analing the not

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,439
are What notes are being produced what

86
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,080
notes are being produced in the

87
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,680
frequencies yeah what's slightly

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,000
different about frequency you you I

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,319
think you started to say oh that's

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,519
actually the then you're like no it's

91
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,480
not actually the same what's the

92
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,560
difference between frequency analysis

93
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,200
and

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,200
um pitches musical

95
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,400
pitches what's what's the thing we need

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,959
to do M I guess some like pictures or

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,720
notes they have multiple frequencies

98
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,280
like overtones so they try to analyze

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,720
that and create like instrument yeah

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
yeah when you play a really low

101
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:26,160
note you can hear some of them

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,440
especially if I take um one of the

103
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,759
[Music]

104
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,960
notes and you

105
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,400
get rid of the really low frequencies

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,880
you

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,440
can start hearing the thing if you ever

108
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,120
are writing a piano piece and you need

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,600
some bells in the background that's

110
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,759
always a good

111
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,600
trick just okay um not too many

112
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,080
composers writing for piano and wanting

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,639
Bells um okay so good so we have um yeah

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,840
so we're we're taking out the harmonic

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
spectrum and uh we're getting the

116
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,479
pitches and things from that what's

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,520
what's the by product if we're thinking

118
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
of like nuclear fion we have all these

119
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,240
energy and we have this Radioactive by

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,240
product what what do we learn when we

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,360
strip out the overtones what might we be

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,960
able to learn um and get down to the

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
frequ to the notes

124
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,800
themselves if you do that with a whole

125
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,120
bunch of

126
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,120
notes or a whole bunch of sets of

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,240
frequencies think it it was already said

128
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,120
but wasn't super explicit the word

129
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,120
already appeared um in what M

130
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,360
said take a take a stab what what are we

131
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,960
talking about when we're talking about

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
overtones and and

133
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,160
harmonics are they always the same yeah

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Vanessa

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
you don't necessarily want to consider

136
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,400
you're considering the individual

137
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,759
pitch kind of present for all of the

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
different like individual pitches that

139
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,599
You' be playing so you need to determine

140
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,919
when that's something that you should be

141
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,560
paying attention to as opposed to like

142
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,160
if it's in a chord or not yeah super so

143
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,560
chord chords definitely an issue problem

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,319
we'll leave that offic up what if we

145
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,280
just follow up um are does every D that

146
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,280
you analyze let's say d octave 4 does it

147
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,960
always have the same overtone Spectrum

148
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,960
no what what determines the

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,599
difference it's okay great John the

150
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,560
instrument the instrument yeah so I said

151
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,240
this this was there so one of the things

152
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
while we're going from frequency I

153
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,880
should have had something up here while

154
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,880
we're going from frequency to um to

155
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,479
pitches the byproduct is we determining

156
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,360
what instrument is being played so we

157
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,840
have that good what are some other other

158
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,759
parts of it that um of the of the

159
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,759
process that we

160
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,120
remember Hannah the duration and Tempo

161
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
the duration and Tempo great does

162
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,479
duration tell you the tempo or does

163
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,360
Tempo tell you who votes duration tells

164
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,639
you the tempo who votes Tempo tells you

165
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,759
the

166
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,120
duration who votes something else

167
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,520
something more complex yeah you could

168
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
also have raised your hand on both of

169
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,000
them there's kind of that weird feedback

170
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,080
loop that you can't tell the tempo

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
unless you have a whole bunch of

172
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,919
duration

173
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,520
but then the temple will also tell you

174
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,759
something about you is that a quarter

175
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,199
note so you second duration good any

176
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:45,840
other parts that stood out

177
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:48,440
from what what what somebody else's

178
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,039
people give great great examples of

179
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,759
something that you could once you think

180
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
you have a score once you're at some

181
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,039
part you could use something from music

182
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,960
theory or history to bring

183
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,800
back I'm going to put you on the spot

184
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,080
cuz I remember yours was very good I

185
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,560
don't remember what okay

186
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,800
good there y all y all do your work

187
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,400
early in the weekend and it's out of

188
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,520
mind any anyone want to make

189
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,800
up think yours was on articulations was

190
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,240
it not spato oh perhaps yeah that you

191
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,280
could find that there's go ahead what oh

192
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,560
no I just going to say that like

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,319
sometimes you might hear it as like a

194
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
lot of notes I followed by like short

195
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,560
rests and not

196
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,159
um but then based on the piece or style

197
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,279
you might go back and mark it as yeah

198
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,240
yeah based based on based on having a

199
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,519
whole bunch of notes that always have

200
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,000
this you large amount of rest you might

201
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,480
say spato or staccato or something or

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,440
the notes are all running into each

203
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,440
other you might say this is legato you

204
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
might get out slurs things good any

205
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,120
anybody

206
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,680
else either remember theirs or something

207
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,680
else come to mind

208
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,680
um trying to trying to remember there

209
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,880
were there were at least three that I um

210
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,680
that I've never seen uh that I never

211
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,240
thought of that I was like Wow and then

212
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,560
then about seven more that I'm like

213
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
we're on the same wavelength with each

214
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,240
other okay I we come back to that later

215
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,680
what one of the things you'll find um

216
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,320
the end of problem set three asks you to

217
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,480
write your own question right it asks

218
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,440
you hey if you had a whole bunch of cson

219
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,320
based on the tools you have for

220
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,839
statistical analysis what kinds of

221
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,240
questions you could ask and it doesn't

222
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,120
ask you to answer that um but you're

223
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,680
going to find um that as the semester

224
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,959
goes on those become bigger and bigger

225
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,560
parts of the problem sets taking more

226
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,480
time you'll be asked to pose your own

227
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,120
question and answer them and um both the

228
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,000
quality of the answer but also the

229
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,160
interest or the the you know of the

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,800
question becomes really important and

231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,279
why why is that important what are we

232
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,360
going to do at the end of the

233
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,079
semester we're going to pose our own

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,920
question and try to solve it right and

235
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,240
what what do researchers do in the world

236
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,440
for the most part they pose an

237
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,800
interesting question and they try to

238
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,880
solve it so we're going to try to make

239
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,839
it so by the end of the semester you're

240
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,839
not just students who are who are given

241
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,920
an assignment to do but also posing your

242
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,880
own your own questions and so you'll

243
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,279
you'll probably get sick of the fact

244
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,600
that I'm asking you to document uh write

245
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,240
doc strings and all that stuff in your

246
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,880
problem sets now and at first it's

247
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,000
pretty silly because I'm asking you

248
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,240
specifically to do you know one task um

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,160
but um you know but then as it goes on

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,720
the more and more complex problems

251
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,160
you're going to be making your own sub

252
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,320
problems uh pet 4 is the first one where

253
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,839
I suggest that you might write some

254
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,680
helper functions that won't be graded

255
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
it'll be the first time where I think

256
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,040
you probably shouldn't try to solve

257
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,279
everything right in the answer um and so

258
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,680
you you know that's a good time to

259
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,560
practice doing that type of

260
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:12,200
thing anything else before moving on to

261
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:15,639
the third little topic um from from the

262
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,680
uh weekend discussion music

263
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,519
XML any thoughts anybody um watch the

264
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,200
interview with Michael Gooden take away

265
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
anything you want to share

266
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,560
he's gonna drop into this class um in a

267
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:39,040
couple weeks I think uh he's visiting

268
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,920
campus uh I think it's is yeah go ahe I

269
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,639
think one thing that I kind of took away

270
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,920
from the deal was just how much effort

271
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,160
goes into like creating something and

272
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,160
then trying to like nor sure it's like

273
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,680
survivability into the future like how

274
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,320
much of your own effort has to G to

275
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,680
advocating for something when there's

276
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,680
nothing to be doneil yeah yeah so he did

277
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,880
this huge he said you know well I came

278
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,240
up with this format and then I had to

279
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,480
Market it and I don't know if everybody

280
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,200
knows finale and sellus some of you all

281
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,839
know Muse score and note flight and

282
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,320
things flat might be the things you know

283
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,880
now as much but yeah th but those were

284
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,920
the two big leaders and he just felt

285
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,199
like if he couldn't get one of them to

286
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,040
use his product he might as well not

287
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:23,880
have made it and then just going around

288
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,920
trying to um trying to make more and

289
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,480
more and more um things out of it and

290
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,160
it's been a super successful uh Legacy

291
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,959
uh Michael good finally retired from

292
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,160
running the U music XML spec from from

293
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,639
taking charge and making sure it was all

294
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,440
working after doing that for uh what was

295
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:49,279
it 20 24 years of doing it um but he

296
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,639
finally found some poor schmuck to take

297
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,360
on that uh role and agreed to do it for

298
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,240
the next couple years um he also

299
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,040
mentions in the the something called uh

300
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,320
mnx which is interesting um that it's

301
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,959
really beginning to uh pick up some

302
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,560
steam and so what music XML was

303
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,160
primarily about if you recall it was

304
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,079
about trans you have data in one

305
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,560
application and you want to get data in

306
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,000
some other application and you don't

307
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,279
want to convert it down to MIDI and lose

308
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,480
spelling and lose all the things about

309
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,279
Tempo estimation and beat and spato and

310
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,199
and all these other things you want to

311
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,680
transfer over into music exml was really

312
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,880
great is really really great for

313
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,440
transferring documents things but once

314
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,360
you get it into your application uh

315
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,959
almost every application you use has

316
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,199
some sort of internal memory

317
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:42,399
representation right you've you've coded

318
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:45,079
things that you store oh I I'm going to

319
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,720
store the name here as a string and

320
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,079
somebody else's well I'm storing it as

321
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,519
an array of characters so I can

322
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,399
manipulate it you know whatever it is

323
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,040
everybody has a different representation

324
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,800
and music XML was not good for that that

325
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,240
wasn't what it was designed for but now

326
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,399
more and more people uh want that and

327
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,120
they want something and so uh M andx

328
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,839
something like music notation next or

329
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,720
something the X doesn't really mean

330
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,160
anything the next format was coming out

331
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,079
and the encoding format the final

332
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,839
decision on that it's going to be

333
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:21,120
entirely Json based do who has heard of

334
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:24,079
Json should who is not feels okay yeah

335
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,959
so it's the the data format interchange

336
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,959
format originally for JavaScript that's

337
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:34,560
what the J JS stands for but now used by

338
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,320
almost every language um it's sort of

339
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,560
where XML was 20 years ago that this is

340
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,480
the thing that everybody knows that's uh

341
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,800
the thing now and so trying to figure

342
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,240
out exactly what's going to how it's

343
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,560
going to work but um but this is pretty

344
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,600
exciting things that that the next 20 25

345
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,360
years 30 years of music notation was

346
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,720
finally decided uh

347
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,639
yesterday so that was uh that's pretty

348
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,040
good it's it's an exciting exciting

349
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,800
world and if you get very into notation

350
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,959
and representation and things you can

351
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,680
jump onto the GitHub repository and

352
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,800
start saying you know no if you

353
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,000
represent a cordian symbols in this way

354
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,279
it will never be useful for what I like

355
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,320
to do with a cordian it doesn't have to

356
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,880
be that esoteric it could even be on

357
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,959
octaves the question is uh we all like

358
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,959
writing things like pitch

359
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:41,000
C4 something like that but um boy you

360
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:45,399
know should it be should it be like uh

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,399
name c and

362
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,199
octave four and therefore you have one

363
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,480
less thing that you have to convert from

364
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,839
a string to an INT there and so that

365
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,560
when you get so that your program won't

366
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,639
CR crash on octave -2 or whatever

367
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,920
happens octave 10 all the things that we

368
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,240
always uh forget to do so anyhow that's

369
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,959
what's been happening uh a little bit in

370
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,800
the

371
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,639
world okay let's get to the main um

372
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,959
topics today um let's start with the

373
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:21,680
concept of equality what's it mean for

374
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,240
something in music to be equal to

375
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,319
something else what's it mean what does

376
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,720
it mean for two notes to be equal I'm

377
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,519
going to uh we're a little bit less um

378
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,920
sort of less uh I don't know vigorous

379
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,360
today than um than we have in the past

380
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,240
so I'm going to I'm going to call on uh

381
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,360
some people just because there's not

382
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,639
really a right wrong answer on this um

383
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,720
the first person I'm going to call on is

384
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,680
Jason then I'm G to call

385
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,519
on

386
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,480
uh then I'll call on

387
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,480
Hannah then uh Paul so what what would

388
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,199
you say means for two notes to be uh

389
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,280
equal I guess abstractly maybe just

390
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,319
thees are the same and durations are the

391
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,640
same okay so pitches are the same least

392
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,480
s pitch

393
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,640
same

394
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,640
duration the

395
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,720
same what do we mean by pitch is the

396
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,559
same abstractly mostly like if you

397
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,640
really want to compare the quencies like

398
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:35,919
the overtones and stuff that might cause

399
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,919
some issues so I guess abstractly

400
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,120
just maybe going down to MIDI is a

401
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,400
little too simple but

402
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,720
like just name and accidentals okay

403
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,320
great the

404
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,880
name and accidental are the same this is

405
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,919
by a very good definition so so we could

406
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,480
completely go with that and do you want

407
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,520
to um change anything go with it um I

408
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,679
was going to say something really

409
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,400
similar probably also consider the

410
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:09,120
octave so

411
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,120
octave has to be the

412
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,679
same um anybody else want to jump in you

413
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,919
want I would say that the you wouldn't

414
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,760
say that the accidentals have to be the

415
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,440
same

416
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,400
so what give me an example of of

417
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,400
something that that would be the same

418
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
without

419
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:49,000
umat

420
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:51,039
dlat and and C sharp great so in this

421
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,840
case not only is The Accidental

422
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,280
different what else is different the

423
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,280
name good so what what can we put

424
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,280
instead for that

425
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,520
what what what what do we call what's

426
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,360
what's a representation that allows

427
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,360
these to be

428
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,880
equal the uh pitch class what you might

429
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,919
be thinking of yeah pitch

430
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,159
class or pitch class plus octave what's

431
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,880
another uh thing that encodes pitch

432
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,360
class plus octave heard this four-letter

433
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,520
acronym used a couple times

434
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,679
John I was going to say space but it's

435
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,240
not four letter it's not four space

436
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,919
space is good yeah Adam mid midi so it's

437
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,240
midi

438
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:53,200
number good so we could do this

439
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:56,880
so so when you turn in your homework for

440
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:04,200
your tonal Harmony class and it says F

441
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:07,200
major 5 to one write this and you put

442
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
in

443
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,400
uh and you get it wrong marked Wrong by

444
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,919
your teacher that that wasn't 5 to one I

445
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
think I got no that's definitely well

446
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,640
that wouldn't be 5 to one anyhow that's

447
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,640
one I'm looking for um

448
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,000
do do all of these notes have the same

449
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,000
midi number

450
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,400
as good so um so maybe we don't want to

451
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,679
go with that because there's there's a

452
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,600
place where your teacher says it's wrong

453
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,799
right on the other hand what are the

454
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,919
consequences of that of of not saying

455
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,919
that M uh are these two notes the

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
same of course when I do this it's

457
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,799
always a trick question what do you

458
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,919
think the answer should

459
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,559
be yes but we already said we're we're

460
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,240
not going to count that the same and I

461
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,600
played a C and A B Sharp you all you all

462
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,640
knew that right I conceptually flipped

463
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,840
the inharmonic between the two so um so

464
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,919
Okay so we've L worked ourselves into a

465
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,799
real bind I think this is a useful

466
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:29,720
exercise but the answer really comes

467
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:33,559
with uh we don't really really know and

468
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,080
we can Define different cases where uh

469
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,600
where we use the words we don't use the

470
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,080
word equal too much but let's say the

471
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,679
same the same

472
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,799
um if I yeah go ahead I just had a quick

473
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,559
question about like what what cases

474
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,559
would this like the the details of the

475
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,799
meaning of musical equality

476
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,919
really uhhuh great we're about we're

477
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,120
about to get into that what what cases

478
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,159
let's we'll open that up as as a topic

479
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,919
to to think about there I can I have

480
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,440
some in my head and it's going to be

481
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:08,799
your your one one slide ahead of me but

482
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,960
um but maybe um Everybody sing sing this

483
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
with

484
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:19,170
[Music]

485
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,760
me well the men's Sayang with me but the

486
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,559
woman

487
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,360
didn't unless we have and a saying

488
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:37,600
seeing this doesn't include the

489
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:40,640
octave right so it um but

490
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,240
also uh we we can think of a lot of

491
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,760
different things that might be slightly

492
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,480
different with each other um we can also

493
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,600
say that here are two

494
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,480
notes bom

495
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,279
bom are they the same yeah in some ways

496
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,840
but also no the first one was on beat

497
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,919
one the second one was on beat two there

498
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,880
might be cases where we want to not just

499
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,200
consider the duration which we didn't

500
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,400
even talk about because I already began

501
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,840
this semester with the trick question of

502
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,360
how many notes we remember that good

503
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,720
good good I'm starting to see smiles and

504
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,200
things uh and not just you know scared

505
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,120
calling me but uh yeah but but not only

506
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,240
uh duration but we might also consider

507
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,480
the what beat it's on that we might not

508
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,080
consider that to be the

509
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,400
same um so there might be different

510
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,279
cases like that uh here's an example

511
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,240
from uh one of these oops well it's even

512
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:40,360
more complex than I expected it to be

513
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,559
without that um great who's who is my uh

514
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,720
uh designated tell Professor when he's

515
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,760
projecting without projector that's all

516
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
of you right you'll all you'll all take

517
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,919
it on yourselves to say in safe time

518
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,559
good um so this is one of these weird

519
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,760
experimental pieces from the 60s and 70s

520
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,480
and things called beru by a composer uh

521
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,840
who's a Dartmouth professor of

522
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,919
philosophy actually uh Christian wolf uh

523
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,679
friend of John cages and this is a

524
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,679
typical things it's in a whole bunch of

525
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:14,200
movements but very famously for me is

526
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:17,000
um the opposite of equal uh is the

527
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:21,679
instructions for number three each

528
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,360
player is to make about 400 511 sounds

529
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,240
each sound different in some way and I

530
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,760
remember uh talking with uh Professor

531
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,600
wolf um he was sort of a guest speaker

532
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,679
in one of my composition classes once

533
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
and he was talking about the

534
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,080
interpretation that this part uh

535
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,080
movement ended up being one of his

536
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,679
favorite ones watching it performed to

537
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,159
see what people

538
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:47,679
did and in one case a player had a

539
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,679
bucket um and then had another bucket

540
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,960
filled with water and took an eye

541
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,440
dropper and dropped one drip of water

542
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,360
into the other bucket and hit it drop

543
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,880
one hit it drop one because the

544
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,640
frequency would change and after 500

545
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,360
changed a lot and so he

546
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,640
thought the the composer was saying Oh I

547
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,080
thought this was very interesting and

548
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,840
other people did all kinds of things but

549
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,880
as you can imagine uh you get your piece

550
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,559
played with a larger Ensemble and some

551
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,760
people are really really into this kind

552
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,640
of music I can find it if you've never

553
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,960
performed a piece like this uh don't

554
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,200
knock it till you tried it it always

555
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,679
sounds kind of I won't enjoy it then you

556
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,880
then you go and do it and you with all

557
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,360
your friends and you're and you're

558
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,360
trying to follow these instructions it

559
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,480
can be quite quite wonderful but there's

560
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,200
always somebody who's not going to want

561
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,440
to do it and it said there was I think

562
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:39,520
it was it was a trombone player who just

563
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,000
sat there b b b b and the composer only

564
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,440
came to the performance not any the

565
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,679
rehearsals and he said he got so furious

566
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,120
at first because the only thing the only

567
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,640
constraint he put on him was on on the

568
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,440
performer was that each note had to be

569
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,520
different in some other way and so the

570
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,520
only thing you can do anything you want

571
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,880
choosing not to and he said but of

572
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,840
course it's 51 notes so I had a long

573
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,720
time to think about it and after a while

574
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,320
I began to really really like what he

575
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,320
was doing because every one of them was

576
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,080
different because first it was a bot out

577
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,279
of the blue then it was a Bop that had

578
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,240
been preceded by a Bop then it was a Bop

579
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,279
that had been preceded by two other ones

580
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,360
and the one that you hear in the 100th

581
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,600
time is very different so this is all to

582
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:31,279
say that we um we can think of equality

583
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,919
in many many different ways and that

584
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,520
there could be different cases where you

585
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,399
want to do something different than the

586
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,640
other um let's go ahead and start a

587
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:43,440
Jupiter notebook you guys are seem to be

588
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,080
pretty fast at getting this and we want

589
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:51,200
to figure out some um definitions of

590
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:54,720
equal that music 21 has used but um just

591
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,760
only to think of what kinds of

592
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,000
assumptions were built into the system

593
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,720
even though or not um you could have

594
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
just about any one so I'm over here and

595
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,919
how do we just just to review how do we

596
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,880
test in Python that X is five equals 5

597
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,760
assert what's that just shout it

598
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,360
assert

599
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,880
assert

600
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,320
x five

601
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,399
no um no what what

602
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,159
what if you were doing it an if

603
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,159
statement what would you do if

604
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,200
x equals equals 5 good good yeah problem

605
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,679
is I have to remember where my trick

606
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,279
questions are and where we're going to

607
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,880
the uh the real ones so you can do it

608
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,320
good

609
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,360
um and Python's a little bit interesting

610
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:52,399
that we can create two mutable arrays

611
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,960
we'll say a is 3 comma 4 B is 3A 4 does

612
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,960
a equal

613
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,640
B yes

614
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,720
remember you say yes no we can hit shift

615
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,519
enter and get it this case yes let's um

616
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,000
I think I can do this up here without

617
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,760
anything going can I make this any

618
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,519
bigger yep I can uh let's do this in

619
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:21,600
JavaScript let X =

620
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:23,279
3a4 let y b = 3A 4 AAL

621
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,240
B

622
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,760
false so two very well often used

623
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,559
languages both kind of scripting type

624
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,679
languages first time I've shown my

625
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,679
console in a while

626
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:43,159
um that yeah that end up with very

627
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:46,240
different results on that let me just

628
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,039
make a note for myself to make sure to

629
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,039
do

630
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,039
that

631
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,399
yeah this is by the way one of the first

632
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,360
mistakes I always make when switching

633
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:01,519
over to JavaScript now python has the

634
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,000
second equality operator so there's

635
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,640
equals equals and

636
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,679
there's is yeah

637
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:14,320
so a is

638
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,399
B

639
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:22,760
false so um do X is

640
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,760
five yes or

641
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:29,279
no you get all kinds of warnings now if

642
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,559
you're on a new p saying that's not

643
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,880
really a great way to do it that's not

644
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,320
really a great way to do it hey stop

645
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,039
doing this Michael stop doing oh but

646
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:48,600
yeah it's true so um various things but

647
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:48,600
if we um so x = 5 yals 5 x is

648
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,760
y true actually it's very odd there's

649
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:59,120
all these weird things that happen so

650
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:03,399
you'll find that um that there other uh

651
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,679
things that that come up um quite often

652
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:09,159
that are all the choice that somebody

653
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,600
made um at some point to do it so let's

654
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:17,880
do music

655
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:22,240
equivalence Ops um from music 21 import

656
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,240
note is that big enough no it got

657
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,240
smaller and here's something I'm going

658
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:31,120
to that I am going to do when I'm in

659
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,240
class n equal note. note capital N

660
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,399
equals note. note and notice I'm not

661
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,279
calling it what I'm saying is the

662
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:43,080
variable capital N can now be used as

663
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:45,799
the class note. note so I can do things

664
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:51,080
like uh n

665
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:54,960
C4 do show and same as anything else I

666
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:58,399
probably should of call that and works

667
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,399
the same so

668
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:03,639
let give everybody a second to catch

669
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:13,639
up I'm going to create two of those C4s

670
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,639
I call it C I'll call it

671
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,919
C2 and what do you hope that the answer

672
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,760
on this

673
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,679
is

674
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,440
true by the way I did I am running music

675
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,039
21 Version 9 and you all are running

676
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,240
version 8.1 or 8.3 or something like

677
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,679
that we changed a few equals things so

678
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,159
if something up here is different from

679
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,000
yours shout out and I'll try to remember

680
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,120
if that's a place we change it but I

681
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,399
don't think we'll get too much into that

682
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:49,440
good so so two notes that the same are

683
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:52,480
there let's call C3 equals and an O the

684
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,760
same note an octave higher so go and

685
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,760
type that

686
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,600
what do we

687
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:06,799
hope yeah could if you're all ever

688
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:12,240
behind

689
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:14,679
uh so false they're not not the same

690
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,799
operation does the duration need to be

691
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:16,799
the

692
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,720
same so let's just remember that c is

693
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,519
the same as C2 let's say

694
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,440
C2 duration quarter length

695
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,799
equals 4.0 what's what's the anyone

696
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,360
remember what's the default quarter

697
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,799
length in music

698
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,600
21 one that's why it shows a coordin

699
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,440
note so we'll make it four which is

700
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:48,840
what whole not good C is the same as

701
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:53,600
C2 false so so good we some a lot of us

702
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,039
have the same um sort of intuition as as

703
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,320
each other maybe that's bad maybe that's

704
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,559
group think um so does anything thing

705
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,080
make an object the same we'll say

706
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,440
C4 equals we'll create another in this

707
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,120
case C4 is

708
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
C4 C equals

709
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:18,960
C4 what

710
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:21,159
about um C here's something you probably

711
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,279
haven't seen LC equals

712
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:28,240
hello we can

713
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:29,880
show hopefully that should work

714
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,760
and c4's

715
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,080
lyric I don't know what what's a

716
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:40,960
favorite language French we do

717
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,960
bonjour does C equals C4

718
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,960
now is that the same on

719
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,519
yours so we've decided the we the music

720
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,440
21 Community I don't can't remember if I

721
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,000
decided this one or not but I'm living

722
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,399
with it that the lyric

723
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,799
does is not an essential part of the

724
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:09,359
equality of a note that two notes can

725
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:13,560
have different lyrics but still be the

726
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,079
same thing um where all Yankovic has

727
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,359
been working on that for a very long

728
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:20,000
time right you can do the same song

729
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,599
Different lyrics still the same

730
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,800
song

731
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:31,760
um okay well let's let's do this

732
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:35,280
one BS uh not for barsh let's create a

733
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,679
BP and but oh if I want the same note

734
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,800
let's let's see how um how anal your

735
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:45,839
your music theory teaching was if I want

736
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,240
the same note as C for sorry C4 in as a

737
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,639
b what's the

738
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,040
octave four four three four well first

739
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,320
let's let's create bar

740
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,720
4 and by the way this is one of these

741
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,480
things I think that there's a lot of

742
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,839
consensus on this but not unanimity so

743
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,160
somebody might have taught you something

744
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:12,320
else but the octave

745
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:14,839
number refers to the letter name and so

746
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,800
when you put lots of Sharps on it even

747
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:22,400
though this this is the same note as C

748
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,560
five five it's still in octave 4 because

749
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,240
the B is an octave four these are all

750
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,720
weird things so we want BS well we can

751
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,320
say pitch.

752
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:37,160
octave equals 3

753
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,320
now guess should be the same note oh I

754
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,480
just slipped it should be the same note

755
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,040
uh as as C Shar right so if it's the

756
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,320
same note or C natural so if it's the

757
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
same note then these two should be equal

758
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,599
right and they are

759
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:57,359
not so how do you work in a world where

760
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:00,240
um where you want this to be equal one

761
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,079
way you can do this um a nice thing

762
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,800
about a lot of languages like python is

763
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:07,640
um you can Mony do something called

764
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,599
monkey patching so we can just create a

765
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:16,319
new equality thing uh return whether or

766
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:19,880
not um. pitch. midi equals b. pitch.

767
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:21,800
midi who's

768
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,440
um

769
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:29,040
um idea and then we can say that n which

770
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,000
is the same as no do

771
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,359
notes it's special thing that you run

772
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,200
uncore EQ which is run anytime you check

773
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,200
equality equals new EQ so now anytime

774
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,319
there's want to do equality we can check

775
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,800
that so we can do um this is Si I use

776
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:54,400
German when I need to do things uh e

777
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:59,520
Shar equals that and F is our normal F

778
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,520
now we can see is e Shar the same as f

779
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,920
yes just before I do do it you will

780
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:10,720
create things like this all the time to

781
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,880
deal with your um definition of equality

782
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,960
do this much less often because I'm not

783
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,880
even sure if note doow will work anymore

784
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:24,640
or if there's other things there yeah um

785
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:27,960
what did you say about um like the B sh

786
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,720
um 4 going back to C4

787
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,839
so so that um the this definition of

788
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:40,119
octave which I used quite a bit has the

789
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:43,280
notion that the octave defines a range

790
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,680
of sort of Staff spaces so if we're in

791
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,680
trouble

792
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,520
cleff this is

793
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,160
all octave

794
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:56,520
four October 4th it doesn't matter how

795
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,599
many flats or Sharps you put down

796
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,960
anything anything that's written on

797
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,839
those staff spaces in shovel cff will be

798
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,440
octave 4 so in this case writing B Shar

799
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:11,640
4 would be pointing outside of the St no

800
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,680
so so B you first see okay I want octave

801
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,119
four and then I want the B and octave

802
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,760
four so it's going to be this one so B

803
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:21,760
Sharp would be this

804
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,480
one even though the C in octave four is

805
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,920
down here so so but but like if you play

806
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,920
the B 4 in this it would still sound the

807
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,000
same as so C5 a C5 yep

808
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,599
great like I said you could probably

809
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,440
find somewhere someone who's not using

810
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,400
that definition and you can definitely

811
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,079
find a lot of places where this has not

812
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,599
been uh well defined um in a lot of

813
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:52,200
textbooks but yep any other questions on

814
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:55,720
that um we can try certain things are

815
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:59,839
um meter time signature anyone play this

816
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,319
play this 34 the same as meter uh this

817
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,240
is why I abbreviate these things time

818
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:07,280
signature

819
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,240
68 copy all

820
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,520
that

821
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,079
oops yes it's exactly the same if you

822
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,960
don't import meter they're both an error

823
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,960
from music 21 import

824
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,880
meter so it's not just based on the

825
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,960
duration of the meter you can try to

826
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,440
figure out there's some ways that you

827
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,800
can Define time signatur such that they

828
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,200
um they might look the same but do

829
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,040
different is um 2 28 + 38 the same as 38

830
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:44,240
plus 28 and so

831
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:46,079
on any other questions on um oh and even

832
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,880
in this case by the way that where we've

833
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,359
redefined to be midi is um here I'm

834
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,079
going to put this up here so it's next

835
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:59,319
to it uh

836
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:59,319
Eis is f false yep

837
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,920
that supposed to happen I think that

838
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:12,240
might be one of the places that um was

839
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,839
fixed in version eight in version

840
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,000
nine yes so that was changed in version

841
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:21,160
9 I think that I remember that was

842
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,960
sometime over um over the holidays I got

843
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,000
an urgent call from somebody who was

844
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,359
like ah I needed this to work and it

845
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,319
didn't okay so that's that's good

846
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,319
there's a lot of things there are still

847
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:34,400
up in the air and um and they're all

848
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:37,560
things that people can debate so equal

849
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:43,079
isn't equals kind of slightly arbitrary

850
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:45,280
in this case um play it but um let's

851
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,720
let's do one um exercise it'll take

852
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,359
about five minutes to do um either get a

853
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,480
blank document you can probably just jot

854
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,240
it down also in Jupiter or it's kind of

855
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,839
more fun with a blank sheet of paper or

856
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,599
something and you're going to hear a

857
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:02,359
shakon which uh is a theme that repeats

858
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:04,760
over and over and what I want you to do

859
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,839
is um there'll be some letters and maybe

860
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,720
don't try to count the number of

861
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,720
measures say like just before a or a

862
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,240
little bit after A or B these rehearsal

863
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,680
letters and want to find out where you

864
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,760
hear the shakon theme each time it

865
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,920
begins at the beginning so you all get

866
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,960
that as a as a freebie but I want to try

867
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:26,839
to um do and then if it's the shakon

868
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,240
theme but transformed what's transformed

869
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:29,240
about it

870
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,480
anybody know that piece before played it

871
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,119
a few people anyone playing it right now

872
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,400
believe it's on yep it's on the wi

873
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,920
ensemble's next concert I saw that

874
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,160
around great so if you like it's a great

875
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,079
piece um one of uh hols greatests maybe

876
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,400
after the planets things but one of one

877
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,560
of his wonderful pieces so about how

878
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,560
many did people

879
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,119
find tell how many you find seven or so

880
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,160
seven or so

881
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,760
about pretty much like there the whole

882
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,000
time it's there the whole time good

883
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,000
anyone find a place where it

884
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,640
wasn't what's different on the second

885
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,720
entrance John good

886
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,520
theyed so it's when harmonized so

887
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,800
something can be a thinge can be the

888
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:32,200
same thing

889
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,200
but harmonized what else is different

890
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,640
everybody

891
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,450
yeah it's what the instrument that plays

892
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,200
it the instrument that plays it

893
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:44,040
[Music]

894
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,440
good I always think that one the

895
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,160
clarinet's going to enter it but then

896
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,040
somebody other one does what else has

897
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,960
changed remember where it started yeah

898
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,960
the Dynamics good so Dynamics we

899
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,839
consider something sometimes to be the

900
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,839
same sometimes not if the Dynamics are

901
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:11,720
different now we're back to a very low

902
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,720
octave which we weren't in every time

903
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:22,960
[Music]

904
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:31,720
[Music]

905
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,920
what's different this time duration

906
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:37,839
duration or we could say spacing between

907
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,680
the two right because the the duration

908
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,839
hasn't really changed but so that's

909
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,520
another thing that we might think of as

910
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,520
the same but

911
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,520
different register instrument

912
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,720
again so um I'm going to fade it out for

913
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,839
a little bit so that we can uh St so all

914
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,280
of these things that we wouldn't say

915
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:06,520
it's they playing the exact same music

916
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,040
right but we're saying in some sense

917
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,520
they're playing the same thing as before

918
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,160
and we'll get one more uh coming in up

919
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,160
in just a little

920
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,040
bit this is very beautiful anyhow

921
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,000
[Music]

922
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,319
what's

923
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,960
here do anyone hear the theme

924
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:43,359
now

925
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:55,800
nobody Hol seems to think that the theme

926
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,559
is still playing here so he doesn't yeah

927
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,839
it's like the concept other the theme

928
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:04,359
still there is just kind of more major

929
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:09,640
theme little bit more Majoris theme yep

930
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:09,640
going yeah is it inverted is it

931
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,280
inverted what do we have here

932
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,920
[Music]

933
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,800
inste

934
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,240
done so it's an

935
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,800
inversion is playing something upside

936
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,720
down the same as playing it

937
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,000
depends it really really depends if I

938
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,960
say let's all sing happy birthday let's

939
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,200
see if I can do this and you all go uh

940
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:43,319
Happy Birthday to uh to how was it going

941
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:46,200
to you you like okay you just ruin my

942
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:50,200
birthday right right so it's not always

943
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:53,599
the same yet there are some places where

944
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,720
composers think of it as the Same by the

945
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,160
way if you don't have that one of the

946
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,400
things nobody said was it's the same

947
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,680
when the rhythm's the same if nothing

948
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:08,680
else right John John John John John John

949
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,880
John John so it is even still the same

950
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:14,800
Rhythm even if it wasn't um perfectly if

951
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,880
it wasn't fully inverted but yeah so

952
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,400
things that are sometimes we want to

953
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,559
consider the same and sometimes we don't

954
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,559
we don't tend to call them equal very

955
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:28,559
much we tend to say that they're

956
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,880
equivalent and there equivalent in some

957
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,680
way or what we'll often use I'm putting

958
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:38,559
this up so somebody might put this back

959
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:38,559
down um is that they're equivalent under

960
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,119
something so

961
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:53,079
um let me uh take something that you

962
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,040
might know uh right now just looking up

963
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,960
there it's a very musical we just did a

964
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,920
follow of John Cage in the time right

965
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,920
now is

966
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:10,119
that anybody prefer that

967
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:14,079
time what's what's the equivalence

968
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:16,720
here how how is it that that some people

969
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,480
might say especially if I put that on uh

970
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,400
that these two are equivalent but let's

971
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,400
let's get rid of that for

972
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,839
now yeah 12

973
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,839
hour 24 hour

974
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:37,680
yeah so 12h hour can can each time in a

975
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:41,280
12h hour in a we could call it an AM

976
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,599
PM um world has an equivalent in a

977
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,200
24-hour you could call it military time

978
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,280
whatever you want to call it world so

979
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,760
that there is an equivalence that allows

980
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,800
the mapping back and forth between them

981
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,920
not all equivalences allow a perfect

982
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,920
mapping good

983
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,870
mathematically what do you need to do

984
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,040
if you're at

985
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:04,520
[Music]

986
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,400
25 p.m. what do you do to convert that

987
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,119
to 24-Hour

988
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,440
time 12 at 12 good and what do you do if

989
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,319
you are at

990
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,240
14:05

991
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:19,280
p.m. and you need to do it you can

992
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,680
subtract 12 or you can think of it as

993
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:26,079
mod mod yeah is it mod 12 or mod 24 both

994
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:31,480
happen to work both happen to work do

995
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:34,119
they no 24 doesn't work because uh 20

996
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,880
2350 okay yeah but in that case it works

997
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,640
in this case it yes in this case it

998
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,280
works yes good always always solve for

999
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,720
the most specific case you can no of

1000
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,960
course well no we'll try solve for the

1001
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,000
most General case so mod 12 there's some

1002
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:54,280
um other little thing that you have to

1003
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,280
do on this uh right if you're at uh

1004
00:48:54,839 --> 00:49:02,160
1205 uh

1005
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,799
PM let's see yeah in that case no I

1006
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,000
can't remember anyhow there's something

1007
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:08,280
off by one errors don't follow don't try

1008
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,440
to figure them off at the but there's

1009
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,400
this particular case where if it equals

1010
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,559
zero you're going to want to add 12 so

1011
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,000
it's sort of uh mod 12 plus I I can't

1012
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,000
remember you'll you'll figure it out I

1013
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,680
know how to do it in music and stuff so

1014
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,520
let's think of some equiv musical

1015
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,280
equivalence classes one of the ones that

1016
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,760
we've put up here and so one of the

1017
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:34,200
reasons we debate a lot about equals is

1018
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,880
that equals is trying to uh create a set

1019
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,920
of equivalence classes once and for all

1020
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:44,680
this is better I'll keep this more

1021
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,680
Center just um

1022
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,040
so here's a

1023
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,119
particular thing that we can debate

1024
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:58,040
whether or not they're equal music 21

1025
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,599
has decided that they are not but that

1026
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,599
could be debatable but we I don't think

1027
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,799
it's debatable that there is some form

1028
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,000
of equivalence between these two what do

1029
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:10,400
we want to call that and inharmonic

1030
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,720
equivalence

1031
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,799
good

1032
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,280
inharmonic

1033
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:19,200
equivalents they are enharmonically

1034
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,240
equivalent somebody tell me if I got my

1035
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,960
e and A's right yeah did this time um we

1036
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:28,480
can also sometimes say they're

1037
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,359
equivalent under spelling under um under

1038
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,319
lack of spelling or say equivalent with

1039
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,040
spelling good what's another equivalence

1040
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:37,680
class that we're we're going to go

1041
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,960
really fast so so let's start start

1042
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,400
thinking what's what's something else

1043
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,400
that we might sometimes think is

1044
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,799
equivalent we said

1045
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,520
inversion sometimes but often not good

1046
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:51,359
what's another

1047
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:55,040
in duration duration sometimes we don't

1048
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:58,960
care how long two things are

1049
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:01,040
good key ooh that would be good great I

1050
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,400
heard another one just tell octave

1051
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,319
octave I should have chosen the one

1052
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,520
without staff lines twice as much space

1053
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:09,799
keep going everybody what's that

1054
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,880
instrument instrument

1055
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:14,760
yeah sometimes

1056
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,480
it sometimes it doesn't matter what

1057
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,920
instrument is playing we'd say it's the

1058
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:23,680
same thing and sometimes when you hire a

1059
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,480
musician to perform uh at your wedding

1060
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,640
and they show up with an accordion and a

1061
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,960
bag pipe it's not equivalent right good

1062
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,760
what other things that that we might say

1063
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,599
context what's that Contex context what

1064
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,400
uh no too broad too broad we'll have to

1065
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:42,200
good good idea we uh give me one context

1066
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,559
that might be like where you're coming

1067
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,040
from where you're going to where you're

1068
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,319
coming

1069
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:53,960
from coming

1070
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:59,160
from from going to so the same song is

1071
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:01,480
the same under equivalent of car stereo

1072
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,880
versus home

1073
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,880
right it's interesting that that we

1074
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:10,480
might think um give me a context we're

1075
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:13,799
listening to the same song uh in your

1076
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,200
recording studio versus uh or or at home

1077
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:18,480
versus your car might be a

1078
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,559
difference the same song might not be

1079
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,440
equivalent under that if the car has

1080
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,319
police sirens in it if the car has

1081
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:29,359
police sirens in it good I was thinking

1082
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:32,640
uh if you're trying to to uh mix your

1083
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,000
composition for submission right does it

1084
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,799
does it matter if you're listening at

1085
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,400
home in stereo with your very nice

1086
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:40,280
headphones is it the same piece as if

1087
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,720
you were um you know let's hope you're

1088
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,559
not doing while driving you're in the

1089
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,280
passenger seat but you're doing it on a

1090
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,400
noisy road yeah so the amount of

1091
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,000
background noise might be a context that

1092
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,799
changes whether or not you think this

1093
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,480
piece of music is the same yeah like if

1094
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:55,079
you're looking at a pitch like what the

1095
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,880
cord is coming yeah I knew that I knew

1096
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,079
that I knew you met that but uh yeah so

1097
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,079
uh

1098
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:07,240
preceding seeding versus

1099
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,920
following

1100
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,319
good other things this this have been

1101
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,119
super

1102
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:18,319
great yeah articulation articulation

1103
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,559
good articulation good shout some more

1104
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:23,680
Tempo

1105
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,960
Tempo the same piece is the same piece

1106
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,680
if you uh rush through it right some

1107
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,280
sometimes s not but yeah good anything

1108
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,520
else we can keep thinking of more I

1109
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,680
don't want to use them all up because I

1110
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,799
think we're going to be asked to come up

1111
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:41,240
with at least uh one that's there great

1112
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:45,520
um so this is this is really really good

1113
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:48,680
you're going to be reading

1114
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,440
um yall got to be

1115
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,200
faster y'all going to be uh reading

1116
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,440
another section from this book by

1117
00:53:53,200 --> 00:54:00,119
Dimitri Tacho um a geometry of music

1118
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,440
and um a second part of chapter 2 which

1119
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:05,200
you read uh earlier when we were talking

1120
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:10,400
about those um flipped inversions with

1121
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:13,599
the mirrors and he defines Five Points

1122
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,760
of inversion or five equivalence classes

1123
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:20,000
that we think of quite often in

1124
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,640
music uh and and he gave them the the

1125
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,119
ordering isn't the greatest ordering in

1126
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,880
the world except it makes it very easy

1127
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:28,920
to remember optic and I'm going to add a

1128
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,799
sixth one Cu uh I I think it's very

1129
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:36,559
important too um the octave quite often

1130
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:40,680
we don't care we the two musical

1131
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,960
elements two chords to be the same if

1132
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,480
they're in different

1133
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:48,760
octaves right or two two notes the same

1134
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,319
note or equivalent note permutation what

1135
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,319
do you think that

1136
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,799
means out you have a cord version of it

1137
00:54:57,319 --> 00:55:01,400
perhaps you want to consider them the

1138
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:03,079
same yeah so we have you have an

1139
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,960
inversion of the chord you might

1140
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:07,240
consider it the same you might the order

1141
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,040
that goes only that would only work if

1142
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:13,760
you also have octave

1143
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,760
um let me

1144
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:20,360
[Music]

1145
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,440
um is there some way that those are the

1146
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:29,640
same

1147
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,319
they're both if I so the first note was

1148
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,720
C they're both

1149
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:39,039
arpeggiated C major Triads right you can

1150
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,960
hear hear that does it matter sometimes

1151
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:42,640
it matters if well you're arpeggiating

1152
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,920
it up and it matters if you're ping it

1153
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,520
down if you're doing your theory

1154
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,720
analysis does that matter if you're

1155
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:52,160
trying to put a cord no so sometimes on

1156
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,000
the other hand if you take uh let's

1157
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,960
stick with happy birthday I'm going to S

1158
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,240
happy birthday to you but I've I've run

1159
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,440
it through my python scramble thing I'm

1160
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,359
going to do um every note in a different

1161
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,440
order we would not apply that

1162
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:07,720
equivalence class to that place so

1163
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,319
permutation um is something that quite

1164
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,400
often when we're just analyzing the

1165
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:14,720
cordal structure of a measure we don't

1166
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,920
really care what order the notes come in

1167
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,799
we just want to see what are all the

1168
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,240
notes in the measure and then figure out

1169
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:22,640
what chord it might be so the

1170
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,000
permutation transposition when us who

1171
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,799
shouted key is that yeah John were you

1172
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,680
thinking

1173
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:32,720
of of that the same piece in two

1174
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:36,960
different Keys could be yeah that and

1175
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,559
just saying like oh I mean is kind of um

1176
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,640
synonymous to an harmonics if you're

1177
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,480
like G flat major okay yep also great

1178
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,839
but sometimes it it doesn't matter

1179
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,000
actually what key you're in if you're uh

1180
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:50,960
if you're a singer and you show up and

1181
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,880
people used to be able to pianist

1182
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,520
accompanies uh collaborators used to

1183
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,960
really know how to do this and stuff

1184
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:00,240
you've been practicing all uh all week

1185
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:03,240
in G major and the the singer comes to

1186
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,839
the concert and says I I woke up with a

1187
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,079
scratchy throat can we take it down to F

1188
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:11,039
today and they play and you're still

1189
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:14,160
playing in some ways the same piece so

1190
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:15,799
the the transposition might not matter

1191
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,599
in some cases in some cases it really

1192
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:21,440
matters one place it really matters is

1193
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:23,799
um if you're playing the viola in the

1194
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,640
orchestra and you choose to transpose

1195
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:28,200
and nobody else does I think people will

1196
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,000
notice right right uh so transposition

1197
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,920
again these are all equivalence classes

1198
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,799
I I didn't do a good job of this in

1199
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,119
other years of lecturing so I want to

1200
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:40,240
say now these are things that in certain

1201
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,599
contexts make sense to apply and in

1202
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,920
certain contexts do not make sense to

1203
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:47,839
apply and so transposition is one here

1204
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,480
uh inversion we've already talked about

1205
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:53,200
in some cases it makes sense to apply

1206
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,920
and some cases it doesn't want to say

1207
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,400
there are two different um a number of

1208
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,599
different definitions of inversion and

1209
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,400
that's actually one of the things

1210
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:07,799
happens one is something that we call a

1211
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:10,000
tonal inversion where you

1212
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:12,760
um

1213
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,799
say no tonal I'll put it in the key

1214
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:19,079
signature something like that instead of

1215
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:23,920
going up four notes we go down four

1216
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:25,799
notes and then go down one more note so

1217
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:31,000
um in this case it's exactly the same

1218
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:33,640
let me go um let me keep going up

1219
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,760
here ah I have to go one more note up

1220
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:39,240
assum these go

1221
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,799
here eventually you get to a point where

1222
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,359
this is a half

1223
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:48,480
step and this is a that was good to L

1224
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:50,880
lines whole step um in a tonal inversion

1225
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,280
you just care that you went up a step in

1226
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,680
one and you went down a step in the

1227
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,920
other if you went up four steps you

1228
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:58,920
don't really care if it's a perfect

1229
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:01,920
fourth or whatever in uh an atonal or

1230
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:04,200
post tonal or non-tonal thing we would

1231
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,079
really want to make sure that where did

1232
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,880
I screw up there has to be some place

1233
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:10,319
because because this this is an octave

1234
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,559
up I'm pretty sure if you go up an

1235
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:14,599
octave you end up going down in octaves

1236
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,839
your first series of notes in the second

1237
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:18,960
the right hand

1238
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,680
one ah uh so that's a sorry I'm now I'm

1239
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,440
in a postal world so now I need to write

1240
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,240
all my accidentals I oh there it is

1241
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,160
that's the whole step and so that would

1242
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:32,440
have to be the half whole step whole

1243
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:34,400
step and there right yeah so uh so those

1244
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,359
are the two kinds of inversion that he's

1245
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,960
talking about um and sometimes it makes

1246
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,440
sense sometimes it doesn't if you listen

1247
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:45,160
to the music of um the the post tonal

1248
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,839
music of the early 20th century uh they

1249
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,400
use inversional symmetry a lot and so if

1250
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,680
you're trying to figure out oh how does

1251
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,280
this relate to something I heard before

1252
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,400
almost always try well is it the

1253
00:59:53,280 --> 01:00:00,440
inversion of it um and there's here some

1254
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:03,200
cool things that um here's here's uh

1255
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,039
four Triads you might know them by name

1256
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,400
um not you don't need to know the name

1257
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,400
but what type of Triad are

1258
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,240
they shout it

1259
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,960
up ma yeah

1260
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,000
major

1261
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,160
minor

1262
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,640
and a

1263
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,960
augmented diminished um so there's four

1264
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,960
different

1265
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:38,200
Triads major minor augmented diminished

1266
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:41,319
a lot of people think that major and

1267
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:44,720
minor have more something more in common

1268
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:44,720
than the other two

1269
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,440
because this goes what's up a major

1270
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:53,960
third up a minor third if you start

1271
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:57,079
instead go the opposite way and you

1272
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,880
start here and you go up a minor third

1273
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:02,760
and then you go up a major third you end

1274
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:06,280
up with a Minor triad so the Minor triad

1275
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:09,400
is the inversion of the major Triad and

1276
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,119
therefore they both have the exact same

1277
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,760
interval content they both have a ma

1278
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:18,400
minor third a major third and a perfect

1279
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,400
fifth within them whereas an augmented

1280
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,079
Triad

1281
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,119
cannot be inverted to become a

1282
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,160
diminished Triad

1283
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:30,960
or to become a major or minor Tri so

1284
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,960
they don't have an equivalence class

1285
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:37,119
between them so this comes up often

1286
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,880
last

1287
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:44,319
cardinality sometime how many notes

1288
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,319
there are sometimes it matters SI as it

1289
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:50,000
doesn't

1290
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:53,240
[Music]

1291
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,240
versus some ways the

1292
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:58,799
same also if you put it together with

1293
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,440
octave and cardinality I'm not going to

1294
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:03,559
run over there again I need to put my

1295
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:07,079
keyboard here a four note Tri major

1296
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:09,599
Triad c e g c now you say that octave

1297
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:12,039
doesn't matter so now it's c e g and a

1298
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,760
second C here and now you really want

1299
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:16,279
cardinality not to matter if you want to

1300
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,720
say is this the same as some other C

1301
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:21,000
major

1302
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:24,520
Tri um and the last one I think's really

1303
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:27,319
important uh Demitri taso comes from uh

1304
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:30,720
a slightly different practice world is

1305
01:02:27,319 --> 01:02:32,520
that he just assumes that spelling

1306
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,640
equivalent or we call midi equivalent or

1307
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,440
enharmonic equivalent I should have

1308
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:40,880
called it enharmonic but I can't figure

1309
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:43,359
out a way to make an e into the optic um

1310
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,079
uh acronym offf so that does does n

1311
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:49,000
harmonic equivalent does spelling matter

1312
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,880
and uh one of the things in his world

1313
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,359
which is very different from music 21

1314
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,279
but in problem set 4 you're going to be

1315
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:56,880
working in the world of optic of

1316
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:59,079
geometry of music uh the spelling

1317
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,440
equivalence is always

1318
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:04,440
assumed yep

1319
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,720
poetic

1320
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,839
p p o oh yeah but then I would have to

1321
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,839
rearrange his yeah no that's really

1322
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:13,599
really good there's another one uh um

1323
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,960
you know that we can start putting in we

1324
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,640
can start thinking of tomber equivalents

1325
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,480
we often think of that all these other

1326
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,920
things that you wrote up there but these

1327
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,559
are the ones that um will give you the

1328
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,279
most hard time on the next

1329
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:31,400
problem uh let's there's not time so

1330
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:33,480
we'll um end this up uh end a little bit

1331
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:37,039
early for the first time in a while uh

1332
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,920
cool we'll get to um working with

1333
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:42,920
intervals next class and filtering

1334
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,920
streams thanks everybody
