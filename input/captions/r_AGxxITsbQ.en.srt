1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:19,119
So now uh let's let's talk about the uh

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,320
let's talk about first the different uh

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,359
concepts uh that we have talked about in

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,240
class and then get and then in the end

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,079
I'll get to just some example of some

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,559
problems that you might face on the mid.

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,719
So the first is this that if you take a

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:42,399
subset

9
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:45,399
of Rn uh to say that a is bounded from

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,399
above.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,039
This just means that there exist

12
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,840
m such that for all

13
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,720
a in a a here is less than equal to a.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,400
This is what it means to be bounded from

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,439
about from a subset, right? And now the

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,439
there's a list of about

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,880
um this is a number uh so so m here is a

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,200
least

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,200
so m

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,079
is a least upper bound.

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:49,960
If

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,960
uh um if uh m is an upper bound

23
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,200
and any other

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,240
bound

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,120
let's call it m

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,120
uh uh is

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,920
bigger equal

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,879
to it. So this is what it means to be a

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,920
least up

30
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,040
and so the least up bounds. So so the

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,000
least upper bounds is this is what we

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,000
denote by super.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,720
Okay. And similarly, similarly form

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,560
for lower bound

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
and uh and in

36
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,519
right and the real numbers have this

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,280
property that if I set this bounded from

38
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,840
above then it has a then there is a

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,840
least upper bound.

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,159
uh and likewise for uh assets that is

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,800
below.

42
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,800
Okay, so that was soup and we'll get to

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,920
this mean soup and make uh I'll just

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,040
review that a little bit later also.

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,440
Uh but that's another important thing.

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,879
Uh a sequence. So another key uh concept

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,200
in this class is sequence

48
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,519
and we let's begin with a sequence of

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,519
real numbers.

50
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,480
[Applause]

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
So this is a map

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
from the

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,560
positive integers

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
into

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:58,959
and again it denotes so the image. So if

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:02,799
you're looking at uh the image of some n

57
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,920
we typically denote this by a n or by a

58
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,799
n or xn or something like that

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,480
where we use the subscript

60
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,160
but it's just the image under this map.

61
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:21,359
So that's a sequence. So for each

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:25,320
positive integer you get a real number.

63
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,320
Then um

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,400
then for a sequence one of the first

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,400
things you are interested in is

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
convergence.

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,610
So if you have so if this here is a

68
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,040
sequence

69
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,720
[Applause]

70
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:50,280
that xn converts to some x here. This

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,280
here just means

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,040
for all

73
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
uh epsilon greater than zero they exist.

74
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,800
I I will use this symbol. I haven't used

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,080
it until now but it's so hard not to use

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,440
it. This means they exist.

77
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,160
It's not on

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,080
but it's a totally standard symbol. So

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,400
they exist.

80
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:22,400
uh capital n such that

81
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,720
if little n is bigger equal to capital n

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,479
then uh xn - x

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
small.

84
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
So this is what it means for a sequence

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,080
to convert

86
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,600
to x sequence x to convert to x and you

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:44,240
write like this or you can write xn and

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,639
then the limit here as n go to infinity=

89
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,240
both of these

90
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,440
are standard use.

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,440
So and then also if a seage is not

92
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
convergent

93
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,479
is not convergent

94
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,800
then

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,800
then we say

96
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,800
is diver.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,360
So sequence is either convergent or it's

98
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:26,680
divergent.

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,680
Um and then you there's this

100
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,480
property

101
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,759
useful property.

102
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,319
[Applause]

103
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,319
So a lema

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,400
if x

105
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,400
is convergent

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Then the set

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,800
this as a set this here is a bounce set.

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,720
Okay, we talk about that.

109
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:12,199
And then another thing about sequences

110
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,199
is that the algebraic processes

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,039
of sequences

112
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,400
and what are the algebraic properties

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,080
they are that if you take two sequences

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:36,720
a n and bn and let's say that a n

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,919
converts to a and bn convert to b then

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,160
the algebraic and c and c is just a

117
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
constant

118
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,240
Then you have that sort of and often

119
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,560
when you combine what I did there is one

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,720
and two before you combine you're

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,000
looking at a n + c * bn this here

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,240
converts to a c * b

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,319
this is the first and this when I state

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,319
it like this it actually combine two of

125
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
the one properties that we talked about

126
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,360
earlier

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:14,560
uh the second one is that a n * B n will

128
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:20,319
converge to a * b.

129
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Third property is that if uh if a n if

130
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,479
these here are not equal to zero and the

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,479
limit here is not equal to zero then 1 /

132
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,479
a n converts to 1.

133
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,959
And so of course this last one

134
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,440
you know this one implies in particular

135
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,959
of course that also bn / a n converse to

136
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,000
b

137
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,800
this is just because this property here

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,680
combined with property two that will

139
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,839
give you this

140
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,080
okay so that's

141
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:01,680
the algebraic properties uh of limits

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,680
um then you have um the concept of a

143
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,680
subsequence.

144
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,279
So a subsequence.

145
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,640
So we are imagining that we have a

146
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,800
sequence and often we don't go all the

147
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,160
way back like this but but a sequence

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,640
again is is a map from the positive

149
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:33,040
integer into R and we know the image of

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,920
N like typically like Xn

151
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,480
then a subsequence of this sequence and

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,519
this is typically denoted something like

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,560
this where you have a further subscript

154
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:51,680
And this is and this is important again

155
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:54,320
that this is like equal to f of g of k

156
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,680
where g here and this is the really

157
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,120
important property that g is a map from

158
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,760
the positive integers into the positive

159
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,560
integers and the really important is

160
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,560
that g here is strictly increasing

161
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,959
And so strictly increasing guarantee you

162
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,959
that these numbers here is taken in the

163
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,360
same order as in the original sequence

164
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,040
but you may skip a bunch right I mean

165
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
you know you take one and then you may

166
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,279
skip a bunch and then you take another

167
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,720
one and then you may skip more but it's

168
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,970
in the same order and that's what

169
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,320
increasing this guinea

170
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,760
[Applause]

171
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,600
and and then you have

172
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,120
then you have this property.

173
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:56,360
So you have this theorem

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,360
that a sequence xn is converged

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,120
if and only if

176
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,600
or all subsequences

177
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,120
And one of these two was one of the two

178
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,320
directions for this was trivial because

179
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,680
if you have a um

180
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,320
because because if you take a sequence

181
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,920
then it is if you're thinking about this

182
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,360
map here G as being the identity

183
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
that's so that will give you a

184
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
subsequence but that really is the

185
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,680
original sequence, right? So the

186
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,720
original sequence is a subsequence of

187
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,720
itself. So if all subsequences are

188
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,200
convergent, well then in particular the

189
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,720
sequence itself is convergent. So one of

190
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,000
those two directions was trivial.

191
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Okay. Now then we had these two theorems

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,920
and they were right by then. So you know

193
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,399
the like the sing the sort of the

194
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,200
singing mathematics is a sinks built on

195
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,160
each other right and hopefully like each

196
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,800
step is fairly trivial but you build

197
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,200
step by step and then you end up with

198
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,959
something highly non-trivial right? So

199
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,440
this here was was pretty trivial but

200
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,040
then we used it later on to prove

201
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
something

202
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,079
non-trivial. So this was this model from

203
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,079
convergence theorem

204
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:45,279
and it has two there was two versions of

205
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:50,880
this. you had a sequence xm

206
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:52,959
and and xm was increasing.

207
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,839
So that means that the next element is

208
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,800
bigger equal to the previous element. If

209
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,800
this here was the case, then XN is

210
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
convergent

211
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,600
if and only if

212
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,279
uh XM is is bound.

213
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,880
If the sequence is bound

214
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,040
and uh the soup

215
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,839
of the exam

216
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,839
this here is is is

217
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,839
the

218
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,480
here is the

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,680
second pro the second verse. of this is

220
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,160
if you have a monot. So instead of being

221
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,920
increasing it's now decreasing. So the

222
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,760
next element is smaller equal to the

223
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,199
previous element.

224
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:04,600
And then similarly uh the sequence uh xn

225
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,600
is convergent

226
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,360
if and only if

227
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,120
X is found from below

228
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,360
below and in this case and if it is part

229
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,480
from below then the limit here

230
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,480
is of XN.

231
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
Okay. So that was the monitor

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,279
convergence there and it has these two

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,399
versions the increasing version and the

234
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,040
decreasing version.

235
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,720
Then

236
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,600
another important concept

237
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,800
was that of the precence

238
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,480
and the use the the the

239
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,360
reason why sequence is useful even for

240
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,079
the real numbers right I mean you know

241
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,560
later on we generalize these concepts

242
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,120
there was obvious generalization of of

243
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,279
the concept of convergence but also of

244
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
that of being a cruise sequence to

245
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,519
metric spaces

246
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,040
But even for the real numbers C

247
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,959
sequence,

248
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,160
you know, you might be interested in

249
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,760
whether a sequence is convergent. But

250
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,160
sometimes it's much easier to prove that

251
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,639
it's a C sequence than to prove that it

252
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,639
actually is convergent. And so if you

253
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,279
don't really care about what the limit

254
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:45,000
is, then it's often uh easier to prove

255
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,000
that it's a co

256
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,160
So cushy sequence.

257
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,240
So you have a sequence again. We're

258
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,040
still in in the real numbers.

259
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,480
And this is a cushy sequence. It just

260
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,839
means that for all and now I will use

261
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,680
also this here. This symbol just means

262
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,120
for all and that's also a standard

263
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,320
symbol. It's a inverted a

264
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:19,120
for all epsilon greater than zero there

265
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:22,800
exist again this here the inver you know

266
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:27,120
inverted e there exist

267
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,759
delta there sorry there exist capital n

268
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,759
um such that

269
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,360
if little n and little m are bigger than

270
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,199
capital n Then those two elements are

271
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,000
bunched

272
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,000
epsilon close together.

273
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,600
This is what it means

274
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,800
for a sequence to be precise sequence

275
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,360
that the tail of the sequence lies very

276
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,360
very close together.

277
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,320
Then um

278
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,360
let me skip uh in my notes I have

279
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,640
something about contracting that but

280
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,480
actually there won't be anything about

281
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,799
contracting that so I'll skip that

282
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:21,520
uh

283
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:24,000
let me uh let me look at let me now next

284
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,000
talk about the

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
convergence

286
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,120
and Put some wires right there.

287
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,799
So you see

288
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,200
also let me just remind you that again

289
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,840
on the midterm so there are these five

290
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,320
main problems then there's a six bonus

291
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,960
problems but make sure that you uh if

292
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,160
you know it doesn't matter which one you

293
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,919
do so you might as well uh start like

294
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,480
with the ones that seems easiest

295
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,799
to

296
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,280
uh and you can see anyway say exactly

297
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,480
how many points each of them give. So

298
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,640
you can uh if you don't have you know

299
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,840
enough time to finish all of this you

300
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,840
can make sure to try to optimize.

301
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,679
Okay. So what is the cushy convergence

302
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:39,520
theorem? So again we are in R sorry uh

303
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,080
and uh and we have and so the CI

304
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:49,240
convergence is the

305
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,240
let's say that if XM is a C sequence

306
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,360
then

307
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,360
uh XM is converted

308
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,039
That's a pushy convers

309
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:20,400
and and and this trans we talk about

310
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:24,799
that. So like the concepts if you when

311
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,280
we in a minute review metric spaces then

312
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,840
convergence sequence that makes sense in

313
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,640
a metric space could see sequence makes

314
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,600
sense in a metric space

315
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,240
um but it's not and the statement of

316
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,679
this theorem makes sense in a metric

317
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,400
space but it's not always that it holds

318
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:49,799
it holds in on but it doesn't hold in a

319
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,799
general metric space. The possum

320
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,360
statement of that

321
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480
also makes sense in a general metric

322
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,600
space but it doesn't hold in a general

323
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,880
metric space. So these are again these

324
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:09,120
are things about the real numbers.

325
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,360
I mean they they extend to more than the

326
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,600
real number but you have to for other

327
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,799
spaces you have to kind of prove it

328
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:21,120
individually right.

329
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,919
So banana bias theorem say that if xn is

330
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,919
a bounded sequence

331
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,080
then

332
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,960
uh xn has

333
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,960
a convergent subsequence.

334
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,679
Okay. So that's simp.

335
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,919
Um the next thing is the next thing I

336
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,880
want to review is what it means for a

337
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,280
function to be continuous. So continuity

338
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,280
is another important property. It's

339
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:06,720
closely tied together with this sequence

340
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,159
and we'll get to that in just a minute.

341
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:15,400
So if you take a

342
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,400
if you take and you have

343
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,159
so so

344
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,320
if you have a function let's say on R

345
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,679
but it could be defined on a subset of

346
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,960
R. So if you have a function like this

347
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:40,280
then we say that f here

348
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,280
is continuous

349
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,720
at x0

350
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,720
if for all

351
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:58,720
uh it's continuous at x0

352
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,960
if for all u epsilon greater zero there

353
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
exist

354
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,919
delta greater than zero such that

355
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:17,880
if uh x - x0

356
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,880
is smaller than delta then the images

357
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,520
smaller than epsilon

358
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,799
um so that what it means for a function

359
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,840
to be continuous and there was this

360
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:39,360
this theorem or lema

361
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,360
that was that tied things together. So

362
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,360
lema

363
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,480
if

364
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,280
uh f is continuous

365
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,720
at x0

366
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,520
and xn

367
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,440
converge to x0

368
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,280
then

369
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,640
then then

370
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,400
the images

371
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,600
of this sequence. So that's another

372
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,600
sequence convert.

373
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,840
So we prove this even in a metric space

374
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,760
but we're still not.

375
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,559
Okay. And so

376
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,640
uh right and then we had the algebraic

377
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,360
properties of functions and they were

378
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,480
very similar to this. So let me just

379
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,039
review them. So algebraic properties of

380
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,039
continuous functions.

381
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,880
So imagine that you have f and g

382
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,880
are continuous functions.

383
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:26,400
Everything is defined on r.

384
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,360
C here is a constant.

385
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,240
Well then property one that correspond

386
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,080
to that property one here is that this

387
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:40,200
function plus C * this function here

388
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,200
this here is also continuous

389
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,520
and then two is that if this function

390
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,960
here

391
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,360
is never equal to zero

392
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,760
then one over this function again is is

393
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,760
also continuous

394
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,520
and then sorry that was not that should

395
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,039
sorry I should not make that the second

396
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,640
I should make that the third property

397
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,919
sorry that f *

398
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,960
is also continuous and then the third

399
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:20,080
property would be that f is not equal to

400
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,960
z correspond to it then this function

401
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,960
here is also contin

402
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,679
and Again I divided it up when I did it

403
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,919
I divided up into four steps because I

404
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:37,039
separated this out as two steps.

405
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,120
Okay. And so from this one we got that

406
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,159
right just because then we proved that

407
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,960
the constant function was continuous and

408
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,159
the linear function the function f ofx=

409
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,360
to x is continuous. Once we have that

410
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,080
then we then we just use one and two.

411
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,120
>> Yeah.

412
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:59,600
>> To prove that all all uh polomials is

413
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,760
continuous. And then if we bring in

414
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,120
three then we have this with all

415
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,320
rational functions are continuous except

416
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,400
of course where the denominator vanishes

417
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,039
by.

418
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,799
Okay. So, so that was how you sort of

419
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,200
built uh continuous functions from non

420
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:23,279
continuous functions.

421
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,360
Um then we proved the extreme value and

422
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,159
the intermediate values theorem. We had

423
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,000
these two zero and they were proved. So

424
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,679
one way to prove it that we did last

425
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,679
time was to use this lemon that tie

426
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,960
together

427
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,640
um that tie together continuity and

428
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,279
sequences.

429
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,200
And so we had the extreme values there

430
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,240
and this just say that if you have a

431
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,919
function but now it's crucial

432
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,440
that this here is a bounded interval and

433
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,440
the end points are included in this. So

434
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,559
if you have a function like this and

435
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,559
this function is continuous

436
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,080
then the soup and the in over the set

437
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:18,400
here is achieved. So max or if you go

438
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:22,840
the max of f and min of

439
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,840
of f are achieved.

440
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,480
in particular the function is bounded.

441
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,360
So I just state it like this little

442
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,919
brief like that. So that was the extreme

443
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,520
value theorem. The intermediate value

444
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,400
theorem

445
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,799
it say that if you have a function

446
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,200
imagine that starting off here and it

447
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,000
ending there. So this is like the

448
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,440
function the intermediate value shall

449
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,200
say that everything in between these two

450
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:59,600
is also the image of something right. So

451
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,440
if let's say that f of a smaller than f

452
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,880
of b

453
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,720
then n y here is between f of a and f of

454
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,880
b

455
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,320
then there exist

456
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,799
x between a and b

457
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,919
so that f of x

458
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,240
is equal to one. Again the functions

459
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,159
we're talking about are continuous right

460
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,720
and they're defined on this inter

461
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,240
this inter

462
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,240
okay so that was those two themselium

463
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,480
right and then they used uh And then he

464
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,279
used how sequences and continuous

465
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,480
functions was tied together. The Banana

466
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,360
bias theorem is using something about

467
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,799
the real numbers are ordered and like

468
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,720
this will soup and if uh uh you know you

469
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,559
have the least upper bound property and

470
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,200
the greatest lower bound property,

471
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,159
right? So

472
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,080
okay now another thing. So there was so

473
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,960
we tal about so like some of the

474
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,960
highlights is like the in terms of

475
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,799
concepts are sequences and continuity of

476
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,520
functions

477
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,720
and then various properties that follow

478
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,120
from this. Then another thing is

479
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,480
sequence series.

480
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,720
So that's another key property

481
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,720
key concept.

482
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,240
So series.

483
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,360
So series is where you started with a

484
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,360
sequence.

485
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,760
So

486
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,480
serious.

487
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,480
So you started with so this here is a

488
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,480
sequence

489
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:14,480
and now you form another

490
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,720
sequence sn but here you sum it and it

491
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,080
could start wherever you want to start

492
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,320
it let's say start from zero you're

493
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,240
summing the first in this case it would

494
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,279
be because you're starting at zero

495
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,559
you're summing the first n + one

496
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:36,399
so ai this is A z +

497
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,399
a n is like n + one in this case, but

498
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,320
you don't have to start at zero. You

499
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,919
start at one, it would be the first n

500
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,440
numbers.

501
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,200
So you're looking at so a series is

502
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,320
really kind of the same thing, but you

503
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,080
think about it a little bit different,

504
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,679
but really the same thing as a sequence

505
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,399
where you starting with a sequence and

506
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,520
then you form a new sequence.

507
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,559
And then the the key question here is so

508
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,559
key question

509
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,600
is the serious conversion

510
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,039
conversion,

511
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:26,240
right? And um so that's a key question

512
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:31,440
and if it is convergent and you often

513
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,320
the series is often written like this

514
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,679
and so this is so this here will

515
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,480
symbolize the series and if the series

516
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:45,200
is convergent it will also symbolize the

517
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,360
limit. So it has two meanings. Okay.

518
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Um but you can but even if it's not

519
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,760
convergent then it well but if it's not

520
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,000
convergent you would just write down and

521
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,960
you think about this as as as a series.

522
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,799
Now there are some series that are

523
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,440
particular

524
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,440
you know important

525
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:12,600
and and they can then be used to

526
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,600
determine whether or not other series.

527
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,159
So let me just review them. And the most

528
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,159
important of all is the geometric

529
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,159
series.

530
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,519
And the geometric series is the series

531
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,080
um

532
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,720
C to the N=

533
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,640
to Z to infinity.

534
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:45,039
This is C is just some fixed number,

535
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,440
real number. And you're looking at this

536
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,120
and this is called this is the geometric

537
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,399
series

538
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,399
and this is is convergent.

539
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,559
uh if

540
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:06,679
the absolute value of C is less than one

541
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,679
and divergent otherwise

542
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,600
and if it is convergent when

543
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,919
when C here in absolute value is less

544
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,919
than one then this here

545
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,120
is = 1us

546
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,760
but remember two things one is that when

547
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,240
you actually want to evaluate the sum

548
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,640
it's crucial where you starting if I

549
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,519
started at one then it's not anymore

550
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,240
equal to this but you have to subtract

551
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,880
the first element right that was missing

552
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,720
so it's really for convergence it

553
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,320
doesn't matter where you start but for

554
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,320
the limits it's it's it's

555
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,240
That's one thing and the other thing is

556
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,360
uh is like when you again we talk about

557
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,360
this that when you're given a series

558
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,120
even before there's any question the

559
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,520
first thing when you have a series the

560
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,800
first thing you look at is does this a

561
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,280
end convert to zero or not right if a

562
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,000
end does not go to zero well the series

563
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,320
is not going to converge there's no need

564
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,960
to apply any fancy test right and and

565
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,639
for a series it's it's always the

566
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,359
question is always whether it's

567
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,359
convergent or not.

568
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,440
Okay. So that's so that's a geometric

569
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,839
series

570
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:45,440
and then there are two other series that

571
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:48,320
we talked about and let me just you know

572
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,000
that not only talked about but we also

573
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,560
determined whether or not they were

574
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,800
converging and they were used then we

575
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,520
used them to determine whether other

576
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,520
series were convergent.

577
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,520
But but the again the most important of

578
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,880
all of them is the geometric series.

579
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,680
That's the one that we use to determine

580
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,440
whether power series in general was

581
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,079
converging or not. But there are two

582
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,880
other that are worth mentioning. One is

583
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,880
the harmonic series.

584
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,400
The harmonic series is the series

585
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,520
1 / n.

586
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,520
So this here is diverg.

587
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,839
So let's call this second

588
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,079
and then there is like a

589
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,839
closely related. Let's call it two and a

590
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,720
half.

591
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,720
That's called the alternating.

592
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,119
So the alternating was that the it was

593
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,760
like the harmonic series but the sign of

594
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,760
it was alternating

595
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,280
and this here is actually converging

596
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,119
and then so there's one two two and a

597
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:21,520
half and then there's three

598
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:25,040
uh three and that's uh that's the series

599
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,520
this series. Here we this year and this

600
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,520
year was converging.

601
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,359
The only one where we determine what the

602
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,359
sum was was actually the geometric

603
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,359
series.

604
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:47,440
Okay. So that's like some key series.

605
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,440
Um

606
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,440
then

607
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,680
then there are

608
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,119
then there's when you have a series

609
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,760
there was one concept that proved to be

610
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,680
quite useful and that's was the concept

611
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,680
of absolute

612
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,680
convergence.

613
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,480
of a series

614
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:23,200
and so you're looking at a series

615
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,480
and absolute convergence was

616
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,800
that this sum here

617
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,800
was was converging. So this here is

618
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,800
absolute

619
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,079
convergent.

620
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,040
If this series where you just the a

621
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
replaced by the absolute value is

622
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,280
convergent. Okay. So of course a non-

623
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,320
negative for non for a series of non-

624
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,000
negative numbers it's automatically if

625
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,320
it's convergence it's automatically

626
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,680
absolute convergent.

627
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,040
And like we talked about it a little bit

628
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,200
that that one of the things about an

629
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,920
absolute convergent is that you could

630
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,680
kind of reorder the value of summing

631
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,280
things and it wouldn't matter for the

632
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,520
limit.

633
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,520
But if it's not absolute convergent that

634
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,760
really matters we thought about it. We

635
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,280
didn't really prove anything there but I

636
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,960
think it was kind of clear you can do

637
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,119
this.

638
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,920
One thing where we used it was that when

639
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,079
we look at product of series

640
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,640
then the product of series was

641
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,200
convergent if each of them was absolute

642
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,680
convergence and there you saw that we

643
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,640
estimated some remainder term and there

644
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,359
was really kind of key that that we had

645
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,440
absolute convergence. Okay.

646
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,960
So anyway, so absolute convergence is an

647
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,839
important uh you know it's it's it's for

648
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,920
a series it's a it's a stronger property

649
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,400
than convergence. So absolute

650
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,560
convergence implies convergence. Maybe I

651
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,240
should write this as a theorem. So we

652
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,240
had that theorem. So absolute conversion

653
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,599
but it's not it's it's stronger.

654
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,599
general.

655
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:20,480
Okay. And now then we had some tests.

656
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,440
Then we had some tests and so we had uh

657
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,640
we talked in particular about

658
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,760
there was a few other tests that we

659
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,599
talked about but but I didn't

660
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,280
um I mean they're not actually going to

661
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,480
be on the victim uh and and some of them

662
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,200
we get back to this one here won't be on

663
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,160
the victim alternating but we talked

664
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,800
about how to prove the convergence right

665
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,599
and the important and and when we talk

666
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,640
about

667
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,960
that we discovered that this thing here

668
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,079
that there was a stronger statement that

669
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,040
if you have alternating and the a were

670
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:03,599
all non negative and these guys was

671
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:07,040
decreasing goes decreasing down to zero

672
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:11,599
then actually any alternating sequence

673
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,640
like that would be would be converging

674
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,920
anyway but but but the test we really

675
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,400
talked about was three test. One of them

676
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,400
had two parts

677
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,240
and then then in a minute we'll talk

678
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:35,200
about how we apply them to power series

679
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:38,520
which one. So we had some tests

680
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,520
to determine

681
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,520
whether or not the series

682
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,240
or not as serious

683
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
uh

684
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,680
is convergence.

685
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,160
Okay. So what are the tests? So there

686
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,160
are the comparison test.

687
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,640
Let me just first write down the test.

688
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,480
So the comparison test and there was two

689
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:17,720
versions. Version A and version B.

690
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,720
Then there was the ratio test.

691
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,200
And then there was the root test.

692
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,119
the ratio test and the root test they

693
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,040
are both offsprings of the geometric

694
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:42,079
series right in both of these you got

695
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,920
let's just talk about these first uh the

696
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:53,040
ratio test was looking at this

697
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:56,720
ratio of a n a divided by a n a n + 1 /

698
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,920
a n so you are implicitly assuming

699
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,440
that the a does not vanish not zero.

700
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,480
Right? So you can form this ratio and

701
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,680
then if this limit here as n goes to

702
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,640
infinity if this limit here is less than

703
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:18,000
one

704
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:20,880
then then uh the ratio test say that uh

705
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
the series was convergent.

706
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,800
If the ratio was bigger than one then

707
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,960
this ordinary element a n would not even

708
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,960
go to zero. Right? So this here is so

709
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,520
that in this case here maybe maybe I'll

710
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,520
write it over here.

711
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,440
So for the ratio test,

712
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,800
for the ratio test, you assume that a

713
00:42:52,240 --> 00:43:00,960
none of the a

714
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:04,640
and you're looking at a n + one / n.

715
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,119
And if this limit here,

716
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,960
let's call this limit, let's assume that

717
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,599
the limit exists. Of course, it may not

718
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:19,040
exist, right? But if the limit existed.

719
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:20,960
So if if C here is less than one, right?

720
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,440
It's always not negative. These are non

721
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:28,200
negative numbers. See is is less than

722
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,200
one, then the series is converted.

723
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:38,319
If this C here is strictly bigger than

724
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:41,440
one, this implies that the series

725
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,440
is diverted.

726
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,880
And if the C was equal to one then it's

727
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,880
unclear

728
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,480
and so unclear which means that further

729
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,480
test are needed.

730
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,680
And so now

731
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,119
um

732
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,800
so that's the ratio test and the root

733
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,839
test was similar.

734
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,640
the root test where so you're looking at

735
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:17,040
the AM you take the so this is the root

736
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:20,000
test and again this is tested by

737
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,400
comparing it to the geometric series so

738
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,280
the root test

739
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,520
so you take the am

740
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,880
take the nth root of this

741
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,400
and you're looking at the limit here and

742
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,200
we actually looked at the name soup.

743
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,240
I write in the new soup. Reason why I

744
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:47,119
want the new soup is

745
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:50,640
that I want to make sure it's later on I

746
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:56,319
want to apply more generally. Okay. So I

747
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:59,520
have uh so if the loom soup here was um

748
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:05,040
was less than one is called soup. It's

749
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:09,480
called C. If if C here is less than one

750
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,480
then uh series is convergence.

751
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,240
True. If the C is bigger than one series

752
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,920
is divergent. This fails the most basic

753
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,599
test divergence.

754
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:30,520
And again uh three if C is equal to one

755
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,520
then it's unclear for test or leave it.

756
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,680
That was the that was those two tests.

757
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,839
The comparison tests, let's get back to

758
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:46,960
that. The comparison test had two parts

759
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:49,599
that you had suppose you had a n and bn.

760
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,839
The first part is this statement that if

761
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:57,520
you have two series, one based on the a

762
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,440
series based on the bn. If you have this

763
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,280
if BN

764
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,599
so this if if this

765
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,599
is converted

766
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,319
then it fires like this it's converted

767
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,720
right and this is sometimes used both

768
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,560
exactly like this and it's also

769
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,560
sometimes used where you know that this

770
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,200
one here is divergent and so you

771
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,200
conclude that this

772
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,720
The other part of the comparison test

773
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:41,200
was if you had the limit here if this

774
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:44,319
limit here exist and it was some L

775
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,880
then actually it it say that let's say L

776
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:55,040
here is not equal to Z

777
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:57,040
then then uh then um then um If

778
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,079
if one of them is converging the other

779
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,760
one is also converging. So

780
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,280
a

781
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,520
b

782
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,520
is converted

783
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,160
that a

784
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,880
and vice versa is actually equivalent.

785
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,599
So those were the three tests that we

786
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,760
really went through. There was a few

787
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,319
other tests like again this alternating

788
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,960
series test that sort of proved but it's

789
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,920
not being unmet and you will be trapped

790
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,400
to this later.

791
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,119
>> Yeah.

792
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,119
>> Um are there like patterns of like when

793
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:43,040
we should apply which tests?

794
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:46,000
>> Yeah. No. And I want to get to this

795
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,920
um I want to get to this in just a

796
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
second.

797
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,839
Uh

798
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,920
let me let me just say a couple of words

799
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,400
first and then let let me jump to some

800
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,160
of the examples of problems and then

801
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,520
I'll come back and I'll review a little

802
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,000
more. So uh but let's just talk about

803
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,560
power shares.

804
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,520
Um maybe maybe a little

805
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,079
whether uh just now when you were asking

806
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,480
the question

807
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,480
uh no this this just review the power

808
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,480
series.

809
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,880
So a power series was a series but it

810
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,760
was something that also defined a

811
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:36,559
function right and so you take so you

812
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,359
have a you have a u

813
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:43,480
you have

814
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:43,480
see power series

815
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,480
so you have a sequence a

816
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:57,200
and then you think for each x but x but

817
00:48:52,480 --> 00:49:02,680
x is being fixed you form a series

818
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,680
and this is the series that you form

819
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,520
and so for each x you can ask is this

820
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,480
series convergent or not right this here

821
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:16,400
is called a power series

822
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,440
and uh and the the key point for a power

823
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,760
series is uh again of course whether or

824
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,400
not this is convergence

825
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,400
and this give rise to the radius of

826
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,400
convergence.

827
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:42,599
And so the radius of convergence was

828
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,599
that we defined we looked at at le

829
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,160
of the nth root

830
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:52,400
of a n like that.

831
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,920
Right? And we looked at when this thing

832
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,480
here

833
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:02,800
uh if this thing here is uh right so we

834
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:05,599
define this thing here

835
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,680
and so we get this thing here and then

836
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,440
we define the radius of convergence. So

837
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:14,680
the radius of conver

838
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,680
of convergence

839
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:23,000
this is r and the r is 1 /

840
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,000
This should

841
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:30,319
but there was an understanding in this.

842
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,280
The understanding is that if this number

843
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:37,119
here this number here you this one of

844
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,599
potential could be infinite. Right?

845
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,000
If it was infinite it meant that this

846
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,800
thing here was zero.

847
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,559
Right? If this one here is is infinity,

848
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,480
if this here is zero, then this here

849
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,119
would be infinity.

850
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,119
Okay, so that's so that's like a

851
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,720
convention in this particular case,

852
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,119
right? I mean, usually we don't want to

853
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,599
divide by zero that kind of stuff, but

854
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,599
this is convention in this particular

855
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,240
case.

856
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,040
And so using this radius of convergence,

857
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:15,040
we saw that if you take a power series,

858
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:19,599
if you have any power shares like this,

859
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:23,839
there have any power shares like this,

860
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:26,319
it's going to be if this here is R and

861
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:30,720
again R could be zero or it could be

862
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:33,280
infinity, right? But if this is R. So I

863
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:38,640
should write this minus

864
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:41,839
then the for x in between for x not

865
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,240
including the end point but in between

866
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,599
the series is converging right the power

867
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:52,119
series is converging and outside here

868
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,119
it's it's diverging

869
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,720
outside it's diverging here it's

870
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,720
converting

871
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,640
and and at those two points here

872
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,920
further test are needed right so this is

873
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:13,040
always this picture so this come back to

874
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,640
your question about you know which test

875
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,520
I mean of course you can use any test

876
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,359
you want but when I you know like if

877
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,000
you're looking at a series you can use

878
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:26,000
whatever test you want but if it was a

879
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,920
power series you already know that

880
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,079
there's some integral around here where

881
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,480
it's convergent and then there's a

882
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:39,440
question about the end points, right?

883
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:44,079
And so um okay, so now let's look at

884
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:47,520
let's look at some examples of this

885
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:50,760
and suppose you look at

886
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,760
and so

887
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:58,240
it's usually not too hard to use either

888
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:02,160
either the roof

889
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:05,119
to to use either um

890
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,280
the this here was based on the root test

891
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,800
to either use the root test or the ratio

892
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,599
test for power but but you can take

893
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,520
advantage of it sometimes slightly

894
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,520
easier. So let's look at two examples

895
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:24,559
here. So suppose that

896
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:27,559
that you ask to find the the radius of

897
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,559
convergence

898
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,040
for the power sh

899
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:46,160
and then let's say that this is n to the

900
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,800
fifth power x.

901
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,040
So suppose that you are this is a power

902
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,640
series you're given

903
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:58,240
and you want to find the radius of

904
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:01,920
convergence right you can either just

905
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:04,880
form you know do

906
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,200
plug it into this test right or you can

907
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,520
just say okay we just apply we know that

908
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,800
it's some interval and I just want to

909
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,040
see for which x does this here converge

910
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,880
so if I looked in this case you might

911
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:21,839
find it slightly easier to do the the

912
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:25,280
root test. So if you're looking at the n

913
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:28,640
+ one elements in this series the n

914
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,720
elements sorry the n elements would be

915
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,599
this to the fifth power think about x as

916
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,559
being fixed right and you're asking for

917
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,200
which and then you want to for given x

918
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:44,640
you want to determine whether the series

919
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:47,280
this series here is convergent right

920
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,520
so if you using the root test you would

921
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,680
look at this one here and you might find

922
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,599
in this case slightly easier to use the

923
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,400
root test.

924
00:54:53,599 --> 00:55:00,240
So if you're looking at this, this thing

925
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:04,720
here is now n + 1

926
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:10,240
to the 5th power * x to the n + 1

927
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:12,480
/ n 5th power * x to the n. Right?

928
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,480
That's a ratio.

929
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:20,559
And so of course you can write this in

930
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:22,559
here. This is like x n + 1 * by itself

931
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:27,920
five times

932
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:30,400
divided by n * by itself five times and

933
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,920
then this thing here you can write as x

934
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,280
to the n * x

935
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,520
uh over x to the n.

936
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:44,800
So you see this thing here you can then

937
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:48,079
think about as n + 1 / n

938
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:54,160
to the fifth power

939
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:56,960
um and and time sorry time x right

940
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,680
and I can write this in here in the

941
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:04,400
usual way if you want you can write it

942
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:06,160
as 1 + 1 / n I'm dividing by n in both

943
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,359
denominator and denominator so you can

944
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,319
write it like this to the fifth power *

945
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:14,319
x.

946
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:17,760
And so now

947
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:20,240
the root test it's asking

948
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,200
it's asking whether this the absolute

949
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:29,359
value of this root test would be then

950
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:32,000
asking if the limit here of x n + one

951
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:34,720
sorry n + 1

952
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,079
if this here has a limit

953
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,079
and then it's asking you if that limit

954
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,520
is less than one if it has a limit and

955
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,319
the limit is less than one when the

956
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:48,720
series is converting and it's diverse

957
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:51,119
one. But in this case, this thing here

958
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,480
this ratio here

959
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:57,920
is 1 + 1

960
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,680
to the 5th power * x

961
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,359
that this is all non negative. So the

962
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,359
absolute value just go over here.

963
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,040
The algebraic property of the limit say

964
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,280
that this this one here goes to zero and

965
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,839
so raised to the fifth power still go to

966
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,559
zero right it's multiply bunch of

967
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:21,839
sequences five times together that go to

968
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:24,319
zero to one so so this here this goes to

969
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,520
one and so even raised to fifth power

970
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:30,799
still go to one so this here goes to to

971
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:34,960
the norm of x right and so the ratio

972
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:38,200
test would be that if x so ratio test

973
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,200
gives you

974
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,520
is that if this norm here is less than

975
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,559
one then this series is convergent.

976
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,920
If the norm here is bigger than one the

977
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:54,880
ratio is divergent

978
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,280
and it's unclear if the norm is equal to

979
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,240
one. So in other words you see that the

980
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,559
ratio test here gives you directly that

981
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:07,760
the radius of convergence is one. Right?

982
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,480
So and and of course you could apply the

983
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,720
root test, right?

984
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,920
The root test is great on this here.

985
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,119
It's ah it's a little bit more know I

986
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,799
mean you have to do a little bit more

987
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,280
argument. It's not very hard but it

988
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:24,000
actually in this case the root ratio

989
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,520
test would be easier to it would be less

990
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,520
to argue than in the root test.

991
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,680
Let's do one more example of this.

992
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,880
So maybe I'll just switch a little bit

993
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,680
to and then I'll come back and review

994
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,880
some more stuff. I will um I'll just

995
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:45,119
talk about a few of the problems that I

996
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,559
added to the end of my review notes

997
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,920
again. I post this with these problems.

998
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:57,799
Um and and obviously they are I mean

999
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,799
it's not exactly problems on the met but

1000
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:13,040
Okay. Also another thing I want to say

1001
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:16,720
is that uh that the the homework uh is

1002
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,160
graded up to an including four. So I

1003
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,920
wasn't actually aware of over the

1004
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,880
weekend. It was supposed to be handed

1005
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,119
back within latest a week of when you

1006
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,799
handed it in and I just discovered it

1007
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:33,359
over the weekend that it was uh some of

1008
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:35,680
them were late. So, but I it's fixed uh

1009
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:40,240
you know I'm I'm not the grader. There's

1010
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:42,799
two ways that are grading and a greater

1011
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:46,960
um but it's all fixed now. So the first

1012
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:51,119
four are are you know you can review

1013
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:55,359
those also for the lecture.

1014
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:58,480
Okay. So the other the other series or

1015
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:03,160
power series I want to look at is that

1016
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,160
so again what is the radius

1017
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,960
the thing about power series the nice

1018
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:16,000
thing about power series is that you

1019
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:20,280
know power series also test about series

1020
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,280
right so it's like you know

1021
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,359
So what is the radius of convergence?

1022
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:36,520
And now the series it's a slightly

1023
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,520
different series. It's this series here.

1024
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,520
So this series.

1025
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,960
Okay. And so now let me again I mean you

1026
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:52,480
could apply the root test. The root test

1027
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,240
is the one that sort of just give you a

1028
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,920
answer. It always give you an answer,

1029
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:01,920
but you know it you may have to work

1030
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,839
harder to find the nth root. So, and

1031
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,720
sometimes it's just easier to use the

1032
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:10,079
ratio test. So, let's use the ratio test

1033
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:14,160
again. So, a n here is n to the 5th

1034
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:18,480
power x^ n / n factorial.

1035
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,880
So if you're looking at a n + 1 / a n,

1036
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,880
maybe I should maybe let me write over

1037
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,880
here.

1038
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:35,640
So if I'm looking at at a n + one a n

1039
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,520
so then I have uh n + 1

1040
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:47,680
to the 3 power

1041
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:50,680
uh * x to the power n + 1

1042
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,680
um

1043
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:58,799
over n + 1

1044
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,520
that is a n + one and then I have to

1045
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:05,680
divide by this. But when I divide by a

1046
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,839
fraction, it's like multiplying by

1047
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,520
the inverse of this. So like this in

1048
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:11,040
here

1049
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,799
n

1050
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:17,599
power

1051
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:23,520
x to the n power like that.

1052
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:27,920
And so again I can what I again I can uh

1053
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:31,680
I can write this in here as um so if I

1054
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:36,480
just do like I did before I would have n

1055
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:39,200
+ one over n to the fifth power that's

1056
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,960
when I take this one here and that one

1057
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,799
together

1058
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,559
then I have when I take those two

1059
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:49,440
together I can get rid of the n here and

1060
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,720
I just get x

1061
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:57,280
and then when I look at the ratio of

1062
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:59,920
these two this one here n + one

1063
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:04,240
factorial you can think about that as n

1064
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:07,920
+ one and then times n factorial.

1065
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:11,440
So this n factorial cancel out with that

1066
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:14,559
and you're left with n + one. So this is

1067
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,839
what you get

1068
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:21,520
and this one here just writing it as we

1069
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:26,400
did before dividing this fraction by 1 /

1070
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:29,280
n in both uh denominator and denominator

1071
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:34,000
and getting this ring here

1072
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:37,760
5 * x n

1073
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,520
and now you see that if and this here I

1074
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:44,599
guess it should have been absolute value

1075
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,599
of So it's absolute value on this

1076
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,280
like that.

1077
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,599
This one here converts to one.

1078
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,200
This one is just x and this converts to

1079
01:03:53,599 --> 01:04:00,079
x. And then this here goes to infinity.

1080
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,559
So the ratio here goes to zero. Right?

1081
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:06,559
I'm using the algebraic property of

1082
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:09,280
limits. So this is converted to zero.

1083
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:13,119
And so you see that it does have a

1084
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:16,880
limit. So the ratio test apply because

1085
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:19,520
that limit is zero for all x. It's going

1086
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,799
to be converged for all x. So the radius

1087
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,799
of convergence in this case

1088
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,599
and of course on the midterm don't just

1089
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:38,880
say that the radius of convergence is

1090
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,839
infinite explain this thing here and the

1091
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,240
more detailed the better right because

1092
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:46,160
even if there's some typos you would

1093
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,319
definitely get you should definitely get

1094
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,160
I mean I'm not great in mid either But

1095
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,520
you you definitely should get positive,

1096
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,680
right? Yeah.

1097
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,240
>> So to get R, is it always like you

1098
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,000
divide by the limb soup? Cuz like is the

1099
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,960
thing on the bottom board the limb soup

1100
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,599
or just the

1101
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,280
>> Yeah. So

1102
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:07,599
So

1103
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:09,280
when you take just a complete general sh

1104
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,720
then

1105
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,680
then um you then the radius of

1106
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,520
convergence is by definition this this

1107
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,760
is related to you. You asked this

1108
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,079
question a couple of times ago that

1109
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,079
because we started with the RA ratio

1110
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,720
test. We did that before we did the root

1111
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,799
test and you were noting that the in the

1112
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,520
ratio test you always comparing an

1113
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:34,000
element to the previous one, right? And

1114
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,799
so but in and in general, right, the

1115
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,119
series can be convergent even though the

1116
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:41,920
next element is slightly larger than the

1117
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,480
previous. If that keep happening, it's

1118
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,799
not convergent. But it could happen a

1119
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,359
few times and then it go really down,

1120
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:53,599
right? And that's fine, right? And so

1121
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:55,920
that's why like the the the the

1122
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:59,119
root test, right, gives you this general

1123
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,280
result about that is always right. It

1124
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:05,520
always work. It doesn't assume that a

1125
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:08,160
end not zero etc. right in any part for

1126
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:10,400
any particular and and it really should

1127
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,640
be in suk right and then it's like

1128
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,359
defined it's also you know it's a number

1129
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:18,319
that's always defined

1130
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:20,319
um and it it's and again you know the

1131
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:24,720
way it's stated here the way the proof

1132
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:28,079
goes is it's not comparing two uh

1133
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:31,920
consecutive a

1134
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,799
um in any particular example the root

1135
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,880
test may not be the easiest way to

1136
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:40,559
argue. Often if you can for a power

1137
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,520
sense

1138
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:46,960
almost always I would say if if it

1139
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:52,160
almost in a power sense it's almost

1140
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:55,920
always easier to use the ratio test but

1141
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:58,960
it require that power shares has some

1142
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,799
nice property for this to apply.

1143
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,799
>> Yeah. So the reason you know that r is

1144
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,640
infinity for that example because you

1145
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:07,599
know for all x

1146
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,559
>> so in this example here

1147
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:15,280
yeah this guy is infinity which means

1148
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:17,280
that this thing here would be zero yeah

1149
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,039
>> but you like you know it's very

1150
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,119
>> but I didn't actually calculate you see

1151
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:24,559
I didn't calculate the end booth in this

1152
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,319
example but if I had calculated I would

1153
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,119
actually it's not very hard to calculate

1154
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:31,359
but it needs some small tricks and So

1155
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,359
and we have yeah which we haven't talked

1156
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:37,200
about

1157
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:40,160
but so that's why like

1158
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:43,680
let me talk about a few other things and

1159
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,599
then I mean so again I mean you you know

1160
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:50,240
I I didn't necess I don't think I can

1161
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:52,880
probably review all what I what I hadn't

1162
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,039
my review notes but let me just talk

1163
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,200
about a few of the problems that I had

1164
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,280
but again

1165
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,760
so the things I Let me just quickly

1166
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:06,000
mention the things I I I may or may not

1167
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:09,760
get to that I have in my review notes.

1168
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,839
So I had also

1169
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:17,920
poverty you know what is le what is le

1170
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:21,040
and so definitely review that also talk

1171
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,839
about the radius convergence

1172
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,239
um and maybe this is all and then talk a

1173
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:29,520
little bit about the power series for

1174
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:33,040
the exponential functions but again all

1175
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,759
the stuff we did on the power series for

1176
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,759
the exponential functions

1177
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,600
And you know at this point we have

1178
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:44,640
established it. This is like um it's

1179
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,799
more like uh I mean there won't be

1180
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,640
anything particular about I mean the

1181
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,679
exponential function itself could be on

1182
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:54,480
the uh midterm but it's not like you

1183
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,719
would have to prove the properties of

1184
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,279
the exponential function. This property

1185
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:02,080
that it has property that the

1186
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,920
exponential function of x + y is like

1187
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,400
the product of that kind of stuff. It's

1188
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:09,199
not on the midterm. Okay. So, I didn't

1189
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:11,759
so it's not part of this review.

1190
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:13,679
The other thing that I probably won't

1191
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,920
get to because I in a minute I'll just

1192
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,080
turn to these other problems is that

1193
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,199
metric spaces definitely review metric

1194
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,120
spaces. Uh it was in the last lecture.

1195
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:25,359
So, you know there's a bunch of you know

1196
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,040
like there's three properties for metric

1197
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,600
space. The distance should be non-

1198
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,199
negative. It should be symmetric and the

1199
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,040
distance between two points should be

1200
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:36,000
zero if and only if those point are the

1201
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,239
same. And then the crucial the crucial

1202
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,120
property in the metric space and that's

1203
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:42,640
like the powerful property is the

1204
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,239
triangle.

1205
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,960
Okay. And so there was a few examples

1206
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:51,759
and review those examples. I I there in

1207
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,400
my review notes like the most important

1208
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:57,600
example I would say this the French

1209
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:00,080
world metric is kind of uh you know

1210
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,440
crazy uh metric that's not one of the

1211
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,840
important ones so I just in just the

1212
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,520
most important ones and then there's

1213
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,440
this with what does it mean to be

1214
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,199
convergent in a metric space and what

1215
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:15,520
does it mean to be a C sequence

1216
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:19,520
and so now let's get to a couple of the

1217
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,440
other uh problems that I suggested that

1218
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,000
you look at

1219
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:27,120
u and so

1220
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,159
so here are two other problems

1221
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,760
u and again you know I won't get to

1222
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,360
there's also problems about message

1223
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,480
bases and you should definitely look at

1224
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:39,440
it but I I don't have the time

1225
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:43,400
even though it's relevant for the mum uh

1226
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,400
I just have to pick some

1227
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:49,040
all of all of the problems that I I I

1228
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,280
have four problems here. All of these

1229
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:55,440
are

1230
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:57,520
okay. So now uh suppose you take suppose

1231
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:01,600
you take a sequence. So I have a

1232
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:04,080
sequence here xn and so often a sequence

1233
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,400
is defined recursively.

1234
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,400
So recursive

1235
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:18,719
so recursively defined

1236
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,719
sequences.

1237
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:23,360
So what does it mean? It means that

1238
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:26,640
typically you have the first one is

1239
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:29,600
defined to be whatever and then the next

1240
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:33,360
one is defined from the previous one.

1241
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,679
And so the one I was suggesting

1242
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,080
looking at here is that you said this

1243
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,080
here the first one.

1244
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,080
Um

1245
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,600
right and then actually let me let me

1246
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,120
and then the next one let me just do

1247
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,719
this one here. It's actually simpler

1248
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,239
than what I have in my notes, but maybe

1249
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:59,320
that one. But but I just want to So the

1250
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:59,320
next one is defined to be xn.

1251
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:07,840
Okay.

1252
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:12,320
And so then uh right. So now uh the

1253
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:14,719
question will be uh for what

1254
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:18,679
for what

1255
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,679
a does this

1256
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,239
have a limit the sequence

1257
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,800
have a limit

1258
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,960
and so you see that in this case we only

1259
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,679
have four minutes left so I only say few

1260
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,920
but this is also it just you do I just

1261
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:43,920
wanted you to review what it means like

1262
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:46,560
for a sequence to be defined recursively

1263
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:50,239
okay and so you see that in this is

1264
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,800
right. You have you have that this thing

1265
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:56,080
here. It is going down. It's actually

1266
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:58,560
going down. It it even could go down by

1267
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,880
a fraction. But now it's like if you're

1268
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:04,000
looking at this thing here, if you're

1269
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,159
looking at XN, this here is definitely

1270
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,920
going to converge. Whatever you start

1271
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:11,760
with.

1272
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,480
So I claim that you will always get

1273
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,960
that you will always get that xn here

1274
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,920
converted to zero

1275
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,960
and it's just you see that if you when

1276
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:26,000
you have something recursively

1277
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:29,120
it's often can pay to just write out the

1278
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:36,719
few first few terms. So you have x and a

1279
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:40,080
x2 is equal to uh a over uh y a is also

1280
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,679
a right because it's the previous one. H

1281
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:47,040
x2

1282
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:56,159
is now uh a / 2 x4

1283
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:58,880
is then uh a / 2 / 3. So this is a / 6,

1284
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:01,280
right? and so on, right? And so if you

1285
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,679
continue like this, you will see that

1286
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,679
they get that it's like a divided by

1287
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,920
some larger and larger number, right?

1288
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,800
And but you have to of course write it

1289
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:14,000
nicely out as a proof, right? But this

1290
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,679
is so this is proving that. But again,

1291
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,600
you know, this here, if you just did

1292
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:19,280
what I did, that would not be enough to

1293
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,400
get full credit, right? So definitely

1294
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:26,560
write out the other thing in the last

1295
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:28,640
minute here. The other thing uh

1296
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:32,320
uh the other

1297
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:35,360
thing here for my example here we look

1298
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:38,800
suppose you take a series like this and

1299
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,640
suppose that a yeah here was less than 1

1300
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,199
/ n²

1301
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,960
and then the question could be is this

1302
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:47,679
series

1303
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:53,239
is the series because you knew this but

1304
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,239
that's all you know is the is

1305
01:14:53,679 --> 01:15:00,440
convergent or divergent

1306
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,440
or divergent,

1307
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:08,560
right? And and and and then I say in the

1308
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:11,920
notes here, I mean in the in the review

1309
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:15,120
here, right? that if either you should

1310
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:18,239
prove that for all such series it's

1311
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:20,800
convergent or if that's not the case you

1312
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:23,600
should give an example of a series with

1313
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,800
this property that is divergent because

1314
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:29,520
obviously if all the a was zero it would

1315
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:33,520
be convergence right but it still could

1316
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,880
be another series with a end that

1317
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:40,159
property that was divergent right but in

1318
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,719
this case it is going to be convergence.

1319
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:46,000
And why is it convergent? Because that

1320
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,760
this series here is convergence, right?

1321
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,320
But we've already seen. So this here

1322
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:54,080
would be like the simple comparison test

1323
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:57,800
like the first comparison test.

1324
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,800
Okay. So

1325
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,320
um right. So these are just like

1326
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:06,159
examples of things you should be

1327
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:08,880
reviewing. Right? They are this like

1328
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:11,840
these sinks here, the two sinks to the

1329
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,640
end that like this one here like this is

1330
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:18,080
super fast. So don't expect it to be

1331
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,159
quite as fast on the m but it just give

1332
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:24,440
you it just give you an idea of what you

1333
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,440
should be doing. Okay.
