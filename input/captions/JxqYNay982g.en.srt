1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,399
good morning and thank you all for being

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,320
here um just uh since I'm I think I'm a

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,080
last minute addition to the program just

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,960
by way of introduction I'm a professor

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,719
of nuclear science and engineering here

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,520
and for the last nine years I've been

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,240
over seeing mit's activities around the

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,439
world as the international Vice

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,679
Provost uh but as was said uh for the

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,800
last year or so I've also been leading

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:34,480
the development of mit's new climate

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,960
project and this project um was

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,600
introduced I don't know whether we can

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,200
move the slides forward yeah well maybe

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,879
um the project was

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,120
introduced

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,920
uh or launched by our president Sally

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,199
cornbluth shortly after her arrival at

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,559
MIT last year and her challenge to the

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,480
community was we really need to do much

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,120
more on this issue

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,240
and she's continued to make clear that

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,960
this is one of her highest

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,000
priorities she found a receptive

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,439
audience about a third of our faculty

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,680
were already working on different

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,079
aspects of the problem and if you

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,320
include students and postdocs and

29
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,600
research staff that probably meant

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,960
somewhere between 1 and 2,000 MIT people

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,280
already engaged in this uh uh process

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,799
problem and they're contributing in many

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,840
different ways one of the ways is to

34
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,119
start new companies uh typically seven

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:47,920
or eight of these are uh spinning out

36
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:50,240
each year based on uh MIT Pi so uh pivot

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,280
bio for example is using synthetic

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,000
biology to produce more resilient crops

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,399
able to absorb nitrogen with much lower

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,600
emissions than uh through conventional

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,360
fertiliz Iz es Boston metal is seeking

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,920
to eliminate carbon emissions from steel

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
production Sublime systems is

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,200
commercializing an electrochemical

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,200
process to eliminate carbon emissions

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,599
from cement production thoen is

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,440
developing a new zero emissions chemical

48
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,200
process to produce hydrogen form energy

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,920
is manufacturing ion air batteries to

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,280
provide long duration electricity

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,599
storage for the grid electrified normal

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,840
Solutions is converting electricity into

53
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,920
the high temperature heat above 1600° C

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,680
needed for many industrial

55
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,159
processes commwell Fusion systems is

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,680
commercializing its compact High field

57
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,760
Fusion reactor technology tokomak

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,000
technology and quaz energy is developing

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,440
a deep geothermal power system using its

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,959
high power microwave drilling technology

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,400
so a lot was already happening when

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,440
president corn Bluth issued her

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,640
challenge what she asked was that we

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,959
bridge the gap between what we've been

65
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,200
achieving as a collection of energetic

66
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,000
and ambitious individuals and the even

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,799
greater contributions we're capable of

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,760
if we act together and the new MIT

69
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,680
climate project is our

70
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,640
response the path we've chosen is a ho

71
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,680
of Institute

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,120
mobilization that's essentially designed

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:41,239
to help us do bigger things more quickly

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,400
the goal is for MIT to become within the

75
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,200
next 10 years one of the world's most

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,720
prolific and

77
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,480
collaborative sources of

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,439
technological behavioral and policy

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,400
solutions for the global climate

80
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:00,959
Challenge and we know that we'll have

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:05,159
succeeded if after 10 years years our

82
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,640
work has changed the expected trajectory

83
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,439
of global climate outcomes for the

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,239
better that's the Benchmark against

85
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:17,959
which we want our efforts here to be

86
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,519
judged the core of the climate project

87
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,840
is the six missions

88
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,600
university-wide problemsolving

89
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,400
communities each focused on a clear and

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Broad objective each Reaching Across the

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,880
in Institute and also outside for its

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,320
membership and each charged with Road

93
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,560
mapping and assessing progress towards

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,320
its Mission identifying critical gaps

95
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,960
and bottlenecks constraining that

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,039
mission and launching and supporting

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,800
projects to overcome those bottlenecks

98
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,800
where our community the MIT community

99
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,160
and our partners are well positioned to

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,240
achieve impactful results the the six

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,080
missions are not surprisingly

102
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,120
decarbonizing energy and Industry

103
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,039
restoring the atmosphere while

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,919
protecting land and the oceans

105
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,639
empowering Frontline communities

106
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,240
building healthy and resilient cities

107
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,639
inventing new policy

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,520
approaches and wild

109
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,319
cards several of our very talented

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,639
Mission directors are here they're going

111
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,720
to roduce themselves in the panel

112
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,479
session that's coming up but just here

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,759
to highlight uh a couple of the

114
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,759
distinctive things about this

115
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,199
effort one is that this climate project

116
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,479
will not create a new school or a new

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,880
college at MIT that's the direction that

118
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,360
several of our peer schools are going in

119
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,919
we considered this too but concluded

120
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,240
that it isn't the right approach for us

121
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,440
partly because there isn't time for it

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,720
second while excellent scholarship will

123
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,199
be a necessary part of what we do the

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,000
primary objective is to contribute real

125
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,160
world impacts at the scale that the

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,360
climate problem demands and this means

127
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,840
working with scaling Partners from the

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,360
very start

129
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,680
organizations

130
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,000
individuals many of you in this room who

131
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,560
understand much more than we do about

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,120
the Practical challenges of building new

133
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,800
Solutions and bringing new solutions to

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,160
scale

135
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,720
and third rather than approaching this

136
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,479
peace meal one solution at a time what

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,919
we're looking to build here is a system

138
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,880
for continually generating new climate

139
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:49,080
Solutions A system that is lay it on top

140
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,680
of our schools and departments and labs

141
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,879
and centers that many of you already

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,120
interact with and that spans the whole

143
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:00,360
Institute if you look at our history it

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,080
suggests that this in institution is

145
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,960
never better than when we come together

146
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,520
to solve big problems and this problem

147
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,639
may be the biggest one of all so we hope

148
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,360
that some of you here will choose to

149
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,930
work with us on finding and scaling the

150
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:23,680
solutions thank you very

151
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:26,960
[Applause]

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,280
much now I'd like to welcome to Stage um

153
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,520
a Amy nordrum who's who'll be moderating

154
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,160
the panel um from mit's technology

155
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,120
review and um a selection of the mission

156
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,120
directors and I'll let her introduce

157
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,479
everyone thank you for joining us and

158
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,479
we're looking forward to hearing the

159
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,039
discussion come on up

160
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,039
[Music]

161
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,840
everyone Jo

162
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,599
me hello everyone good to be here with

163
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,120
all of you today thank you Rebecca for

164
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,240
the introduction and Richard for the

165
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,400
remarks I may nordrum at MIT technology

166
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,240
review and we have a rare opportunity

167
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,560
here to have a number of the mission

168
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,599
directors from the new MIT climate

169
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,400
project together speaking publicly about

170
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,479
this important work I think they've been

171
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,159
mostly heads down since the announcement

172
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,319
uh of their roles earlier this year so

173
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,360
looking forward to catching up with them

174
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,599
and hearing what they've been focused on

175
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,120
and also hopefully getting to some of

176
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,440
your questions throughout the discussion

177
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,280
so please do get those in uh through the

178
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,280
app to kick us off I would just love to

179
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,720
ask each of you to introduce yourselves

180
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,159
uh tell us your name and what project or

181
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,519
Mission you are in charge of and if you

182
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,080
could name one climate problem within

183
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,159
that area of focus that you think

184
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,399
deserves more attention and

185
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,399
resources okay so my name is benedetto

186
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,959
marelli I'm an ass professor in civil

187
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,200
enironmental engineering and I'm

188
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,600
directing the wild cards Mission and so

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,800
the wild cards by definition has no real

190
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,240
Focus everything is a focus and what we

191
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,760
try to do is to scout technologies that

192
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,839
have a very high potential to really

193
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,399
drastically change the trajectory of

194
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,160
climate but of course that will be also

195
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,399
High

196
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,959
risky thank you so I'm Chris canido

197
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,480
professor of Applied economics in the

198
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,320
Sloan school and I'm the mission

199
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,200
director for inventing new policies I

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,640
think so it's it's it might sound weird

201
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,880
for a professor at the Massachusetts

202
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,160
Institute of Technology to say this but

203
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,720
technology alone is not going to solve

204
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,839
this problem almost by definition so uh

205
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,079
climate change is a classic example of

206
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,839
an extern ity and in the presence of a

207
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,360
negative externality you need policy to

208
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,440
come in and intervene into the market to

209
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,959
make things better and the question is

210
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,519
how do they intervene into the market so

211
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,640
one of the big folky of of this will be

212
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,079
to think about new ways to intervene

213
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,079
into the market to bring along the

214
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:54,360
technologies that should be adopted but

215
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:57,399
aren't being adopted by their themselves

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,279
and also change consumer

217
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,360
firm uh Behavior if in ways that are

218
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,360
more uh

219
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,680
proclimate uh hi my name is Mio maero

220
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,399
I'm a faculty member in architecture and

221
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,480
urbanism and I'm leading the Frontline

222
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,160
communities um empowering Frontline

223
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,839
communities Mission and I think in many

224
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,200
ways my mission um infuses all of the

225
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,360
different missions that we have here and

226
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,079
um there's two sides to it one in the

227
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,440
mitigation side we want to make sure

228
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:35,279
that the clean energy economy that

229
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,519
there's equal and diverse participation

230
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,880
in that and also that the technology

231
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,920
invented reaches everyone and not just

232
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,000
the people that can afford it um so

233
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,200
working with Co mit's collab and other

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,920
groups within MIT we hope to work on

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
that on one side and then on the other

236
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:55,040
side the impacts we've seen of the

237
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,200
climate having changed already uh

238
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,200
modeling work working with the

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,920
scientists at MIT and down scaling with

240
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,120
engineers at MIT and really working with

241
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,279
industry Partners to have that

242
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,279
technology for modeling and scenario

243
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,800
building so that places can prepare uh

244
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,040
is a really big Focus that we need to

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,760
consider thanks M good morning my name

246
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,519
is Christoff Reinhard I'm a colleague of

247
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,279
Miu in the School of Architecture and

248
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,920
planning I the director of the building

249
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,440
techn ex director of the building

250
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,880
technology program and now I direct uh

251
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,920
the resilient cities uh Mission um why

252
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,200
are we focusing on cities you all know

253
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,040
probably the statistics uh over half of

254
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,519
the population worldwide is living in

255
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:42,600
cities uh over 75% of the carbon

256
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:47,440
emissions are generated in uh cities and

257
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,440
um sorry um

258
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:58,240
and sorry that hasn't happened to me in

259
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,560
in a long time and uh and a lot of our

260
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,440
um resources are also located within uh

261
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,000
cities and when we look at what MIT is

262
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,519
currently doing overall then we are very

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,959
good at engagement we're working with

264
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,639
the private sector with the public

265
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,800
sector and we are um engaging with

266
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,120
Frontline communities at the same time

267
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,760
we are extremely good at Urban analytics

268
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,320
and we are coming up with new Solutions

269
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,800
be it more uh innovative ways of air

270
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,360
conditioning buildings and what we are

271
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,519
hoping to do within this mission is

272
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,959
basically to vertically integrate

273
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,480
because this is something which I which

274
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,160
I think is really missing that we are

275
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,240
bringing these three different groups

276
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,920
within MIT closer together and within

277
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,720
there we are probably going be going to

278
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,480
focus on building first because they

279
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,000
have such a big part of um form such a

280
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,279
big part of the carbon emissions

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
worldwide wonderful thank you all there

282
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,120
is much work to be done in all of these

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,680
areas of course but I want to begin with

284
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
a few areas that we have spoken about uh

285
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,079
as having Common Ground between your

286
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,199
missions and where you might overlap

287
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,519
your efforts so let's start with

288
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,519
electrifying heating we have seen a lot

289
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,240
more heat pumps being sold in the United

290
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,480
States in recent years in fact they've

291
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,360
outpaced the sale of gas furnaces for a

292
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,639
few years now so there's progress but is

293
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,920
that transition happening fast enough

294
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,480
and what more needs to be done here and

295
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,440
Christof I'd love to start with you sure

296
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,920
I mean electrifying heating is somebody

297
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,920
that everybody is talking about uh as

298
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,440
Chris said the technology is there and

299
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,440
we are promoting it very heavily but of

300
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,000
course the tricky thing is for lot of

301
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,360
households should we actually Implement

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,639
heating because right now if you're

303
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,800
having a natural gas furnace it's

304
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,160
actually a bad economic decision to do

305
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,199
this so it's for the better of society

306
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,000
but it's necessarily better for the

307
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,839
individual so we have to really figure

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,120
out how to create policies that make

309
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,720
this tenable for everybody on a

310
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,880
technological side Elsa olivetti isn't

311
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,079
here but it's not necessarily even a

312
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,959
good thing to just uh put a heat pump in

313
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,480
place because we are shifting the peak

314
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,040
loads from the SU air conditioning for

315
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,199
electricity to the winter and we are

316
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,600
actually not really clear where that

317
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,320
electricity is going to come from so I

318
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,839
think more integrated ways of thinking

319
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,199
about this nobody should get uh a heat

320
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,040
pump without having photovoltaics on the

321
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,279
roof weather Rising the buildings as

322
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,160
well so that it makes an overall good

323
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,399
contribution uh to the system as a whole

324
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,839
yeah Miho do you want to speak to that

325
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,160
as well in terms of making it work for

326
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,040
the

327
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,360
individual yeah so that's been a

328
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,040
challenge to exactly because of what

329
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,800
Kristoff has been saying that um there

330
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,720
is this trend going towards but whether

331
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,320
it makes economic sense for a family to

332
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,240
do it depends on how old their current

333
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,440
furnace is and making these decisions

334
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,240
along the way including weatherizing the

335
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,560
building and Mass Save does a lot of

336
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,880
that there are so many resources on the

337
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,800
table to do it but then if you imagine

338
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,240
different families who don't have

339
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,360
necessarily the time to go through that

340
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,279
process where working three different

341
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,680
jobs and and um and so I think trying to

342
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,480
make sure that these Technologies when

343
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,360
they're available how that information

344
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,680
about the resources available get

345
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,360
communicated to different communities um

346
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,920
is really a big part of what we'd like

347
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
to work

348
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,880
on and Chris there's been as Miho

349
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,199
mentioned a lot of government incentives

350
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,560
State programs uh encouraging people to

351
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,440
install heat pumps so how well has that

352
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,800
worked and is that the best Str will it

353
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,480
get us all the way there what else do we

354
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,360
need yeah so this is a classic example

355
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,519
of how policy can make things worse um

356
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,279
and I'm going to I'm going to resist the

357
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,880
urge to jump on my soap box I'll I'll

358
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,839
I'll point you to a a Boston Globe opet

359
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,880
I wrote last spring on on this very

360
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,880
topic but the way we price electricity

361
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,600
is absolutely terrible for two reasons

362
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,040
one is we don't the cost of electricity

363
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,079
to generate electricity moves a lot

364
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,600
within a day across seasons and so on in

365
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,519
the typical location in the US you face

366
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,240
the same price regardless of what the

367
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,040
actual cost of generating that

368
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,759
electricity is the second and and most

369
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,079
relevant for heat pumps is we have if

370
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,880
you think about the cost of running an

371
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:18,600
electricity system you have all these

372
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,240
wires that are in place this

373
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,160
infrastructure that's in place and then

374
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,120
you're also generating electricity wires

375
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,639
are to an economist called a fixed cost

376
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,199
right they don't vary depending on how

377
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:33,800
many electrons are flowing through wires

378
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,120
yet we turn that to the consumer into a

379
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,160
volumetric charge so if you look at your

380
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,519
bill right now over half of your per

381
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,480
kilowatt hour charge is paying for those

382
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,519
wires so what what that means is if you

383
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,199
give me a heat pump today give it to me

384
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:54,120
for free I won't want to use it because

385
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,880
the price of electricity on the margin

386
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,560
is is more than twice what it should be

387
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,800
so it's cheaper for me to run my furnace

388
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,640
than it is for that heat pump so that's

389
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,360
a

390
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,240
problem um I think it also points to the

391
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,919
fact that and we have data on heat pump

392
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,760
adoption in in Massachusetts the

393
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,799
majority of heat pumps are being adopted

394
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,319
during the summer but really most of the

395
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,559
heat pumps my my impression is although

396
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,679
we can study this most of those heat

397
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,600
pumps are going to replace window unit

398
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,880
air conditioners rather than actual

399
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,480
furnaces so so is that a good thing I

400
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,880
guess on the margin that might be a good

401
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,039
thing since they're more efficient than

402
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,400
those window units but but they're not

403
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,039
going to lead to the deep

404
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,559
decarbonization that we think they're

405
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,919
going to lead to so this is where policy

406
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:45,640
needs to be aligned with with the

407
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,960
technology yeah that's a great

408
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,120
perspective I want to turn now to the

409
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,799
topic of data centers and energy and

410
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,720
water demand which I'm sure is top of

411
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,240
mind for many of you out there in the

412
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,720
audience and there's been a lot of news

413
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,520
about this recently uh there's Rising

414
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,080
demand uh for energy for data centers

415
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,799
and water to cool them of course we've

416
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,200
seen Microsoft recently uh strike a deal

417
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,840
to restart Three Mile Island for nuclear

418
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,480
energy Google is working with an

419
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,120
enhanced geothermal company called fvo

420
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,240
to provide electricity to its data

421
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,400
centers these are all really great

422
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,320
corporate efforts but ultimately kind of

423
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,240
peac meal so I'm curious and maybe I'll

424
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,919
start with you again Kristoff what do

425
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,440
you see as the most sustainable path

426
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,200
forward for all of society on this

427
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,280
issue I mean data sets are obviously

428
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,480
very uh critical right now for our

429
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,840
economy and our Innovation we need them

430
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,240
they're also very hard to handle because

431
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,480
we cannot ramp them up and down really

432
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,000
easily so they're really like a Sitting

433
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,880
Duck in a way that uses a lot of

434
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,679
electricity uh so from a city

435
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
perspective they're interesting because

436
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,480
wherever a lot of electricity is being

437
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,000
used a lot of heat is being generated so

438
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,400
thinking of innovative ways of cooling

439
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,520
the system and using the rejected heat

440
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,840
in the building sector I think that is

441
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,720
really an attractive notion that has a

442
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,360
lot to do with where we are actually

443
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,159
placing uh the data center so if we do

444
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,720
that in the upper United States where

445
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:10,240
it's cooler that's probably a better

446
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,280
idea than if we are uh creating extra

447
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,039
heat in Silicon Valley or somewhere in

448
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,520
the desert so there are the synergies

449
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,280
that we should probably think about more

450
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,080
as a society where where we want to

451
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
place

452
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,039
them and Chris I believe you had some

453
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,720
thoughts on this topic as well yeah and

454
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,039
and and it piggybacks off of what

455
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,120
Kristoff just said I I think we're we're

456
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,600
kind of being defe a lot a lot of times

457
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,360
when talking about data centers we don't

458
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,360
have to take the location as given um

459
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,760
and in fact they might be an asset to

460
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,600
the grid if we could optimize where we

461
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,240
place them um and that could be placing

462
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,520
them in low carbon regions it could be

463
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,880
potentially changing the contracts that

464
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,760
data centers sign with their customers

465
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,720
so right now they are very

466
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,960
inflexible uh but that's because when a

467
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,840
when when I go to buy data center time

468
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,120
with AWS

469
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,960
they don't offer me a contract that pays

470
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,159
me to be flexible right in in theory at

471
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,360
least to an academic I don't care if it

472
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,679
takes a millisecond longer to do my

473
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,320
calculations if you're a DAT if you're a

474
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,960
stock Trader maybe it does but a lot of

475
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,120
demand through the data center could be

476
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,760
flexible more flexible and then it could

477
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,280
follow load from intermittent uh

478
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,440
renewable generation or or move

479
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,679
depending on what the season is and so

480
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,159
on so I think there's a lot lot of space

481
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,960
here to think about how we can use data

482
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,000
centers as an asset and not just a shift

483
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,520
out in the in in the load for for

484
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,960
electricity benedetto it feels like an

485
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,640
area where we could use a wild card or

486
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,720
two what do you

487
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,960
think many

488
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,280
options some of the options would also

489
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,720
to completely reinvent how data is

490
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,120
processed and where data is coming from

491
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,559
and the Silicon based Technologies

492
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,039
eventually can also be replaced with

493
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,679
other Technologies so there are of

494
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,039
course many opportunities I think what

495
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,400
the wild cards will have to do is to

496
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,120
evaluate how quickly they can be scaled

497
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,039
and how quickly they can have an impact

498
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,480
because there are so many ideas that are

499
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,080
coming with uh new technologies that

500
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,880
have a lot of promise but we are on a

501
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,200
Time clock and so when it comes to the

502
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,039
wild cards really is understanding and

503
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,000
evaluating what can be scaled in a 10 to

504
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:26,640
25 years time period to have a real

505
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,080
impact and a tangible impact on the

506
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,039
climate of course also generate wealth

507
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,720
and be sure that everybody can benefit

508
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,440
from it yeah that's a tough

509
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,159
job okay well I want to now change over

510
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,520
to a topic that we all have in common

511
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,440
which is food and Agriculture and

512
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,679
producing all the food that we all eat

513
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,760
every day this is a really tough area in

514
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,799
which to reduce emissions particularly

515
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,320
as the global population grows and

516
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,080
people become more wealthier and begin

517
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,400
to eat more and more meat it's also a

518
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,799
deeply cultural topic and shaped by the

519
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,760
geography and the weather uh wherever

520
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,080
you live and the ability to produce your

521
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,919
own food is a very you know powerful

522
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,200
thing and important to uh many people so

523
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,880
mial I'll begin with you does knowing

524
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,880
all of that affect how you approach this

525
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:17,039
challenge compared with other uh other

526
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,240
areas I think this challenge is

527
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,000
exceptionally difficult because beyond

528
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,679
all the things that you included there's

529
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,919
also the cultural aspects of where where

530
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,679
and how farming has been done in a lot

531
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,159
of places I'm thinking more globally

532
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,400
rather than just within the United

533
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,679
States and so I do think that it takes a

534
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,320
significant amount of time from whatever

535
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,279
is invented in the lab to actually then

536
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,240
reach a global scale um and so it's a

537
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,240
big

538
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,600
Challenge and Mi I'll stick with you

539
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,400
because you spoke in a previous panel

540
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,440
about how hard it is to scale up the

541
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,760
kind of community engagement efforts

542
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,080
that you typically have done in your

543
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,279
work which are by their very nature very

544
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,320
time intensive require relationships

545
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,279
built over many years how are you

546
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,760
thinking about that now

547
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm still thinking about it still

548
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,880
struggling um but I've had the

549
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,559
opportunity in the last month or so to

550
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,120
meet so many new faculty members that I

551
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,679
hadn't met before across MIT and

552
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,400
understanding they also all have their

553
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,200
networks and so then already

554
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,760
exponentially this has grown and I plan

555
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,799
in the spring to host several workshops

556
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,960
also with my other um Mission leaders to

557
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:28,240
really reach much more of a global

558
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,799
um global leaders in communities and

559
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,960
have having a much wider Network um

560
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,400
where we will find ways to still have

561
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,760
that kind of quality connection but um

562
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,840
be able to share what we're doing here

563
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,960
and also learn from all of the issues

564
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,720
that they are

565
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,799
facing yeah that's encouraging to hear

566
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,240
uh benedetto food and agriculture what

567
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,080
Solutions are on your mind what have you

568
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,480
seen out there that looks interesting

569
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,240
another area where I think we need some

570
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,640
radical new thinking well I'm very

571
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,200
biased because this is my area of

572
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,520
expertise and research but I I think

573
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,400
that food it could be an agriculture

574
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,080
would be a very very good test beds for

575
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,880
the whole climate project because it

576
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,760
brings together all the missions like uh

577
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,440
food and agricultural systems are

578
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,840
producing 30% to 35% of the whole

579
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,679
greenhouse gas emissions plus we have a

580
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,400
big big societal problem which is the

581
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,960
fact that we are producing too much food

582
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,520
effectively believe it or not but we're

583
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,840
wasting it too much food right so the

584
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,919
food that we are wasting can feed 1.6

585
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,520
billion people while we have almost a

586
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,360
billion people that suffer from food

587
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,120
insecurity and at the same time 25% of

588
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,760
the water that we're consuming goes in

589
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:38,480
food that is never eaten I just gave a

590
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,640
talk last week at the an anticipatory

591
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,720
talk for policy maker actually and it

592
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,320
was about what agriculture will look

593
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,679
like and it's going to change it's going

594
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,200
to change completely it's going to be an

595
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
additive agriculture right so we're

596
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,600
going to add two billion people and

597
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,760
there's not enough land so we need to

598
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,399
find new way to make food and we need to

599
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,080
convince people that there are new ways

600
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:02,080
to make food and they need to eat

601
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,760
different food and as cities are growing

602
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,080
um the amount of processed food will

603
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,120
increase so the impact will increase so

604
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,320
overall I think um the opportunity here

605
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,679
is to and this is why the climate

606
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,760
project is so important because you need

607
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,760
a the whole Institute to work together

608
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,279
toward this big thematic that go from

609
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,559
education to research to policy to

610
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,640
knowing directly from the stakeholders

611
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,279
what they want but also educating the

612
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,080
stakeholders to what they can get out of

613
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:35,360
innovation and and so I think this is

614
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,919
very exciting for food and the and the

615
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,240
wild cards would be extremely well

616
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,159
poised to innovating food and

617
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,200
agriculture particularly having in mind

618
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,440
uh communities that don't have access to

619
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,640
food but also the world South which is

620
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,960
going to be in their need of food as the

621
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,919
hot topic for uh climate change and for

622
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,320
population growth are there yeah lots

623
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,159
more to come lots to follow there it

624
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,720
sounds like well I do want to take an

625
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,200
audience question I see a couple of good

626
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,360
ones coming in and we'll try to get to

627
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,320
some of these as we go I'll begin with

628
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,600
the top one there giving the most votes

629
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
and I'll open it up to anybody who would

630
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,640
like to speak to this which MIT Clean

631
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,960
Energy Research domain is most right for

632
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,799
commercialization and Partnerships with

633
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,799
industry you would like to take that

634
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:23,279
one I mean I'm biased but I think Urban

635
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,640
analytics is something especially if we

636
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,799
look beyond the United States uh where

637
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,240
we have made a lot of progress I always

638
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,720
say part of the city's Mission I want to

639
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,880
model every building in the world

640
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,440
meaning that we are able to predict

641
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,600
energy use potential for overheating

642
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,880
potential for various energy saving

643
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,799
measures and there's this is already a

644
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,200
really busy place in the startup

645
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,559
industry and I think a lot of startups

646
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,000
are trying to develop good use cases but

647
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:50,520
I think usually the quality of the

648
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,200
energy model in the background isn't

649
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,159
very good so I think this is something

650
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,159
where MIT can really make uh in

651
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,799
collaboration with partners and

652
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,679
countries across the world World a real

653
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:05,640
fast uh effort where we provide

654
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:09,080
simulated data for free to everybody for

655
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,279
usage be it cities or be it um

656
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,880
individual startups or companies to

657
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,919
basically understand where in the

658
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,720
building sector is the carbon used where

659
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,720
are the opportunities to reduce the

660
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,039
carbon and I think this is something

661
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,360
that U we can start right away first off

662
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,880
I've heard you say this a few times that

663
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,760
you want to build a model of every

664
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,279
building in the world so just say a

665
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,640
little bit more about that like how do

666
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,720
you do that what what can we learn from

667
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,320
that have you started like what I don't

668
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,360
know what that look like I'm it's a good

669
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,200
tline uh I noticed um we have Model 25

670
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,000
cities in the world so I'm not just a

671
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,399
guy talking um uh and so there we've

672
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,159
engaged with cities the the use case has

673
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:49,480
been that a lot of cities says that by

674
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,440
2050 they want to be carbon neutral

675
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,080
because it sounds good and then most

676
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,600
cities have no ideas of what to do to

677
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,519
their building sector to realize this so

678
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,440
we are basically harvesting this a big

679
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,919
Urban data set combining them with

680
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,919
detailed knowledge of the building stock

681
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,760
and then saying this is current energy

682
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,760
use these are related carbon emissions

683
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,640
and once we have that we can also say

684
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,440
How likely is that a building is going

685
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,399
to get hotter than another building so

686
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,480
doing heat waves what can we do about

687
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,440
that and of course it just provides like

688
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,679
a step by step uh technologically driven

689
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,000
pathway what you can do and so um I

690
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,159
think we actually just built a model as

691
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,799
a prototype of 2 and a half million

692
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,440
buildings in Massachusetts so uh if you

693
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,480
sent me an email we are not making it

694
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
public but I can show the URL where you

695
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,360
basically see you can zoom on every

696
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,279
building here and we are now working

697
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,159
with the state together to understand

698
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,120
what kind of value can you gauge from

699
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,279
that that's so interesting uh well Chris

700
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,240
I'm going to come to you next with a

701
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,159
question about the grid uh there has

702
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,000
been a lot of progress uh especially in

703
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,279
California installing batteries that

704
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,279
have lowered the risk of rolling

705
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,720
blackouts there during heat waves but

706
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,360
there's still many interconnections that

707
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,720
need built there's a Transformer

708
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,159
shortage uh many renewable projects are

709
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,600
running into permitting delays what do

710
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,000
you think are the most important new

711
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,840
policies or reforms that we need to help

712
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,159
us move to a grid or to a grid fuel

713
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,640
primarily by

714
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,080
Renewables yeah I would say it it really

715
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,960
is about the infrastructure so right now

716
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,679
if you build a solar farm in some parts

717
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,720
of the country it will take six years to

718
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,679
interconnect that solar farm to the grid

719
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,080
like that just can't be uh it's hard to

720
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,320
have 2030 goals when it takes six years

721
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,080
uh to to interconnect uh zeroc carbon

722
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,559
Technologies and even data centers on

723
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,480
the load side it can take multiple years

724
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:45,320
before you can connect so on the policy

725
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,399
side we need to fix that queue uh how do

726
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,960
how how do we allocate costs one of the

727
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,320
problems with interconnection in in many

728
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,360
locations is the first one the

729
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,039
interconnect Bears the burden of the

730
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,919
cost so that means you everyone wants to

731
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,240
wait for everyone else to be first in

732
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,480
line and and then that just creates this

733
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,640
que and reordering of the queue and and

734
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,799
so on and then transmission more

735
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,279
generally so uh my we have a research

736
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:14,000
center here called the Center for Energy

737
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,880
and environmental policy research where

738
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,440
over the past year we've we've modeled

739
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,720
uh specific bills that are on the floor

740
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,919
of Congress right now to build more

741
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,640
transmission and look to see what that

742
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,640
does to cost what it does to reliability

743
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,799
resiliency and in carbon emissions and

744
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,039
our grid is not set up for a zeroc

745
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,679
carbon world so in the past we've been

746
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,720
able to move power plants to where the

747
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,760
people are but right now the good

748
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,679
renewable resources are where the people

749
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,679
aren't so we're going to need to move

750
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,720
those electrons much further distances

751
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,760
than we have in the past um and you have

752
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,360
this you know kind of cool I I don't

753
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,279
know why I I think I might be the only

754
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,159
one that finds this super cool but if

755
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,320
you build a bunch of transmission east

756
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,679
to west you actually take advantage of

757
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,039
the sunrise and the sunet um so that

758
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,320
allows your Renewables to go further

759
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,760
when the sun is down on the east east

760
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,080
coast we could be importing electricity

761
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,320
from the west coast and vice versa you

762
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,720
wouldn't import it that that far but you

763
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,760
get the the drift so we need to beef up

764
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,080
what that that grid looks like in order

765
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,559
to take advantage of uh all these

766
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,120
renewable resources that's such a cool

767
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,200
idea and there was an audience question

768
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,639
related to that on transmission and

769
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,919
whether some of those transmission

770
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,679
projects how they would impact the

771
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,000
wiring cost that you spoke about earlier

772
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,080
yeah and I think Brian Brian De brought

773
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,760
this up um you know again um from a

774
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:47,000
policy standpoint we we rate lines very

775
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,519
crudely uh when thinking when an

776
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,360
independent system operator who's

777
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,519
running a grid is thinking about how

778
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,399
much electricity it can move from point

779
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,240
A to point B the amount of capacity on a

780
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,720
transmission line varies depending on

781
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,039
weather conditions um but we don't take

782
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,799
that into account at all um so there are

783
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,919
a lot of ways that we could expand what

784
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:11,960
the the transmission capabilities of the

785
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,320
grid without actually building anything

786
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,519
and there's also technologies that can

787
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,320
uh better handle where the electrons are

788
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,600
flowing in the in the grid and so on so

789
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,320
that's a a I don't know the answer to

790
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,399
this but you could imagine um a

791
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,480
regulatory framework where a utility

792
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,200
wants to build new transmission lines

793
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,880
but not use their transmission lines as

794
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,360
uh efficiently as possible and I'm not

795
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,960
pointing fingers I'm just saying one

796
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,039
could imagine a regulatory framework

797
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:46,200
like that so that's where thinking about

798
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:48,559
how policy can can actually better align

799
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,440
the phys physical capabilities of the

800
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,799
grid uh with with what um it's allowing

801
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,360
the power plants and load to

802
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,720
do excellent thank you all for the great

803
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,799
questions keep those coming we're going

804
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,519
to jump around a bit because I do want

805
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,080
to get to a couple more of these Miho

806
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,720
why don't you take uh that last one how

807
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,240
do we engage this is a hard one how do

808
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,279
we engage public and Community Solutions

809
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,159
in a highly individualistic Society such

810
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,120
as America how do you get people

811
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,840
thinking differently about some of these

812
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,880
solutions that we

813
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,960
need um I mean it is starting to happen

814
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,159
we're seeing micro grids we're seeing

815
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,559
different Community neighborhoods coming

816
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:32,279
together um I think that it is it's a

817
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:35,399
difficult very very difficult question

818
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:38,159
um likely we will have to make quite a

819
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:40,080
few changes in ordinances and permitting

820
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,440
in order for these kinds of

821
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,880
neighborhoods that want to work on

822
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,880
something like this to come together

823
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,840
um and figure out how to explain really

824
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,480
what the economical benefit and the

825
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,840
societal benefit is of uh Community

826
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,760
Solutions and then the public sector can

827
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,200
play a big much bigger role because I

828
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,960
think a lot of issues that we're looking

829
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,240
at too is just like so many of these

830
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,079
Technologies focus on home ownership and

831
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,000
then a lot of the communities that we do

832
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,679
work with don't own their homes and so

833
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,320
how do we then within public housing and

834
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,720
other places like that also um leverage

835
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,200
what it is that we're working on here

836
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,480
it's a great Point Kristoff just maybe

837
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,119
to build on that I think this is where

838
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,919
through the missions are also learned so

839
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,679
many activities that go on at MIT and

840
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,560
last Wednesday there was a great event

841
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,399
hosted by Mariana aaya a professor and

842
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,599
dust we were in aate and worked with

843
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,919
various communities and in order to talk

844
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,240
to lowincome folks there what they can

845
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,879
do actually to better their buildings we

846
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,720
had like a three-step Approach at the

847
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,879
beginning we did a game all together

848
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,159
everybody got a budget on $9 million in

849
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:57,119
the computer and we modeled how do you

850
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,320
best basically uh picking from various

851
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,880
Technologies reduce the energy use of

852
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,240
this apartment buildings within a budget

853
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,599
and then Mariana basically took it over

854
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,520
and asked about what is actually

855
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,079
important to you as individuals and

856
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,839
finally a came in and said as it happens

857
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,520
we have here all the coupons you can do

858
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,920
this right away so I think our

859
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,599
colleagues are been doing really fun and

860
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,520
Innovative works and I think through the

861
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,000
missions we we can scale that yeah those

862
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,040
are examples are so useful in thinking

863
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,960
about these issues um all right benetto

864
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,640
let's talk wild cards this concept cep

865
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,320
is so intriguing I think a lot of

866
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,359
companies out there would love to have

867
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,800
more of this kind of innovative Blue Sky

868
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:38,880
Thinking but it's so rarely happens how

869
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,599
do you go about encouraging this what

870
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,920
are some of the conditions that help it

871
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,320
to take hold that you hope to Foster as

872
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,040
Mission director so we're still trying

873
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,920
to understand how we can hack the Wild

874
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,000
Card uh wild cards is difficult to give

875
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,359
you a recipe that is going to work

876
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,560
everywhere I would say the most

877
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,119
important aspect is uh uh first of all

878
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,240
having a very peripheral vision so to be

879
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:08,400
sure that we not um avoid um considering

880
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,440
some technologies that's just because

881
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,240
they it seems like they don't have much

882
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,720
sense at the beginning so it requires a

883
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,839
lot of understanding of the new

884
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,520
opportunities and but also be requires

885
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:21,720
being bold and try new things I would

886
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,119
say one of the major effort that we're

887
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,000
going to have is really engaging the

888
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,839
stakeholders that know about the

889
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,400
problems very quickly like the details

890
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,960
of the problems that the wild cards are

891
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,800
going to solve very quickly and these

892
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,880
are industry first of all because you

893
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,079
are the one that actually solve the

894
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,160
problems uh and the second of all is

895
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,240
also the communities that will be using

896
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,760
the wild cards uh we will have a

897
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,839
completely different approach whether

898
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,720
the wild cards have will have an impact

899
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:49,119
in the global south or what is called

900
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,040
the global North uh because that would

901
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,680
require a completely different um

902
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,319
landscape of scale up at deployment uh

903
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,800
but also it will will require to operate

904
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,079
with different type of margins so we

905
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,200
would like to focus on wild cards that

906
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,880
maybe have lower margin but go big when

907
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,680
it comes to the impact of society and

908
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,800
this would be mostly so Society for

909
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,280
their well-being right and this is

910
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,440
really for the global South for the

911
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,640
global North we're going to look mostly

912
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,640
at solutions that could help um mitigate

913
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,160
uh climate change and but a little bit

914
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,240
less on adaptation probably um I think

915
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,839
the one of the

916
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,000
biggest determinant for a wild card C is

917
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,760
that it has to happen in a very short

918
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,119
amount of time the inovation right so if

919
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,960
I think of the of the two wild cards

920
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,520
that we that occurred globally in the

921
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,800
past years are covid first of all covid

922
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,040
is a it was a real wild card and and the

923
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,680
deployment of the covid technology so

924
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,000
the the rapid testing and the vaccines

925
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,319
was our reaction to a wild card and so

926
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,040
those are good ways to think about how

927
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:54,480
we Scout Technologies so thinking at

928
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,760
technologies that are

929
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,560
already have a very um advanced

930
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,599
technology Readiness level which was for

931
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,800
example the MRNA vaccines which we knew

932
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,880
could happen but then it required really

933
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,560
a lot of investment

934
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,480
policym and also convincing people

935
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,040
adoption right so which was the biggest

936
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,160
problem in reality uh and so that would

937
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,040
be an example and the other example is

938
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,760
the revolutions that we had with the AI

939
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,079
uh in the past uh year or so where

940
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,560
really AI came I mean AI is a is a old

941
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,079
story but the application of AI to the

942
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,400
to the common people and the fact that

943
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,680
it became uh an opportunity that

944
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,680
everybody now can use to enhance their

945
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,400
lives so that's another case study they

946
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,960
were having to evaluate how we can use

947
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,319
wild card and how we can uh successfully

948
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,720
select them yeah that makes a lot of

949
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,280
sense and then coming back to climate

950
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,480
change there's an audience question here

951
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,560
for you about which area do you think

952
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,200
has the highest potential for wild cards

953
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,880
at the moment is there an industry or

954
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,560
sector that you have your eye on so

955
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,280
believe or not this is the question I'm

956
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,040
asking myself every day when I go to

957
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,480
work work so I don't have the answer yet

958
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,040
I would say

959
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,680
um tying in with what was said before uh

960
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:11,560
having an idea

961
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,920
of understanding how to build a climate

962
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,880
conscious Behavior Uh from PE from the

963
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,359
people perspective that could be a wild

964
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,319
card like really having people

965
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,040
understanding that they need to change a

966
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:25,200
little bit

967
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,599
um what they're doing and the need to so

968
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,960
far the world has really been anthrop

969
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,880
entric so we really thought about that

970
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,640
the human head was the only important

971
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,640
thing because we always fight we always

972
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,480
fought against nature right and now we

973
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,960
shape nature too much and at at the

974
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,920
expense of everybody um eventually so it

975
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,800
came back to us and so we need to change

976
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,480
also how we perceive climate and what we

977
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,119
need to change in our daily Behavior

978
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,400
without consuming less because I think

979
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,200
one of the biggest issue with the uh

980
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,839
climate conscious behavior is that

981
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,720
everybody perceive it oh we need to

982
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,960
consume less and I think that's not the

983
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,160
answer because that will decrease the

984
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,800
economy in reality right so we simply

985
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,440
need to find the balance between uh what

986
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,640
we consume and the impact that it has on

987
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,640
our world so that would be one of the

988
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,720
focus for for sure the White cards yeah

989
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,200
I want to take one more audience

990
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,319
question here it's getting uh the most

991
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,560
votes the topic of water and land use

992
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,920
keeps being avoided how do you all

993
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,680
balance these resource demands with our

994
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,520
enthusiasm for energy as you say we're

995
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,520
all consuming well it's avoided because

996
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,280
the directors are not here that is true

997
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,560
it's we don't care about it it is also a

998
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,040
mission yeah but each of you obviously

999
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,200
there's a lot of intersection with your

1000
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,079
areas so who wants to speak to that well

1001
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,240
I can start I mean one of my research

1002
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,599
Focus F fi sorry is U food and

1003
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,319
agriculture so land is part of it and uh

1004
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,960
and also water so I think we will focus

1005
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:57,760
extensively on be sure that we are

1006
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,880
becoming good Steward of the water and

1007
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,200
land and that the new technologies will

1008
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,280
will will have a good impact on on those

1009
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,000
two aspects yeah and look climate change

1010
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,720
I talked about negative externalities

1011
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,960
climate change isn't the only negative

1012
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,000
externality out there so um when we

1013
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,400
think about policy impacts we're not

1014
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,359
just looking at one benefit we're

1015
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,319
looking at the full Suite of benefits

1016
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,760
and uh so you know sometimes the you

1017
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:25,040
could have co- benefits sometimes you

1018
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,440
could have costs that are incurred

1019
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,800
because you're trying to fix a problem

1020
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,200
over here

1021
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,200
and making exacerbating another problem

1022
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,720
so that's certainly within the realm of

1023
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,040
of how we think about policy policy

1024
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,359
impacts winners and losers that's going

1025
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,520
to be front and center on in the policy

1026
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,160
mission for sure and and land use and

1027
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,040
water is just one of those local

1028
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,640
pollution is another right um you know

1029
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,319
as we decarbonize can we decarbonize in

1030
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,160
a way that actually benefits on the

1031
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,040
local pollution side as

1032
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,920
well you're each early in your process

1033
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,720
here and you're as benedetto said you're

1034
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,359
kind of setting out your priorities and

1035
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,800
proposals and thinking a lot about which

1036
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,920
issues to tackle first uh and you're

1037
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,599
charged with accelerating you know

1038
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,839
scalable Solutions in each of your areas

1039
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,720
so I'm curious how are you looking to

1040
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:16,520
evaluate all the projects and proposals

1041
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,680
and phone calls that I'm sure are coming

1042
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,920
your way these days what are some of the

1043
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,680
criteria you have in mind to make sure

1044
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,040
the things that you do back or put your

1045
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,839
resources behind are scalable and

1046
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,319
practical and can have real impact in a

1047
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:32,040
short amount of

1048
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,160
time anyone who' like to take that talk

1049
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,160
about that all the time uh and it's very

1050
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,520
hard be in this to evaluate what we are

1051
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,960
doing because even if we say for example

1052
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,359
we want to focus on retrofitting

1053
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,720
building it's not us who are going to

1054
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:50,319
retrofit every building in our free time

1055
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,280
so in a way we have to try to understand

1056
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,599
what of our recommendations that are

1057
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,520
being put out are being adopted in the

1058
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,520
world and uh based on that hope

1059
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,680
um see that we have an impact I think

1060
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,960
it's also very practical if we are

1061
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,160
creating uh certain resources and we see

1062
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,720
that um millions of people hopefully are

1063
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,960
using this um then I think that

1064
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,880
constitutes

1065
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,000
success it's very difficult yeah and

1066
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,240
everybody claims every carbon I think

1067
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,040
every uh CO2 ton of CO2 that's being

1068
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,280
saved there are four or five people that

1069
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,160
say it was me the homeowner the

1070
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,760
installer the maker of the heat pump

1071
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,280
everybody gets a

1072
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,119
ton complicated I think for me is really

1073
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,319
evaluating whether the solution is

1074
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,240
scalable because I think one of the big

1075
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,280
problem with climate Tech is to be sure

1076
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,920
that it can be scalable has economically

1077
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,240
sense at at scale and can be scal in a

1078
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,359
short amount of time and that's where I

1079
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,760
really eventually like to engage with

1080
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:53,240
the industry because that's where we

1081
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,599
need to see whether there's already an

1082
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,240
infrastructure present or if some of the

1083
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:02,520
industry leaders are ready to maybe

1084
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:06,040
change some of their um efforts and some

1085
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,119
of their fori to focus on these new

1086
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,599
scale up opportunities that they have so

1087
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:13,520
that they can make money but also having

1088
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,760
a positive impact on climate me I'd love

1089
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,520
to end with you can you tell us about a

1090
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,440
community that you've come across that

1091
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,359
demonstrates the kind of climate

1092
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,200
resilience or preparedness that you're

1093
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,720
hoping to Foster in more places as you

1094
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,240
look across all these missions and areas

1095
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,800
that need a lot of work how much time do

1096
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,880
we have there's we have one one and a

1097
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,040
half minute there's so there's so many

1098
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,400
of them around the world that are and

1099
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,559
and and some of IT addresses the

1100
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,359
previous question of land use too is

1101
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:42,119
like there are some communities that are

1102
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:45,079
moving

1103
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,480
um from the coastline and really

1104
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,119
understanding land use wise where should

1105
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:54,079
we be building and Kristoff has a

1106
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,720
statistic of how many more uh locations

1107
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,440
we'll be building and how much more

1108
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,440
housing we need to build glob globally

1109
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,359
and so where are the decision- making

1110
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,160
points for that and then also being

1111
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,640
courageous to make decisions to move

1112
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,200
when necessary um and then there are a

1113
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,680
lot of other places that have um started

1114
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,680
building in things even to their Parks

1115
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,240
right so how do you then design your

1116
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,480
Park so that it then prevents uh

1117
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,640
flooding for the rest of the

1118
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,880
neighborhoods around it and there are

1119
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,280
many different ways and many different

1120
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,280
places that um the people are starting

1121
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:32,599
to work on on this and I think

1122
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,079
one series of win-wins would be finding

1123
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:37,160
ways where we can for example for

1124
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:39,839
schools for

1125
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,800
shelters you need the shelter where then

1126
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,960
there is a hurricane and you need people

1127
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,800
to evacuate to it so then it's great if

1128
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,160
it's off- grid and it's able to still be

1129
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,559
sustained in those extreme conditions

1130
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,880
whereas at the same time making a

1131
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:57,040
school into a system that is able to

1132
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,079
operate like that you are reducing

1133
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,200
energy loads and then also teaching

1134
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:03,280
students about how all of this is a

1135
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,720
win-win situation alog together and so I

1136
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,680
think there're multiple places that are

1137
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,880
doing that too and I've gone over time

1138
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,800
and so I'll stop here well I think

1139
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,599
that's a perfect note to end on uh thank

1140
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,720
you all for your excellent questions I

1141
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,040
wish you all best the best in your work

1142
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,040
we all need you to succeed no pressure

1143
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,070
and uh thanks for your time today thank

1144
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,169
you very much

1145
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,169
[Applause]
