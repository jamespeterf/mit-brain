1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,480
Okay, everyone, let's get started.

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,120
We have an exciting day ahead of us with

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,320
an enormously fantastic lineup of

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,160
speakers and um poster presenters. So,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,320
good morning everyone and welcome to the

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,279
third variant of function symposium here

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,560
at the broad um institute. I'm really

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,720
excited to see so many familiar faces.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,640
How many hugs this morning were already

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,520
given? It's incredible. It's lovely to

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
see that um we have such a strong V2F

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
community and also lovely to see so many

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,600
new faces for everyone here in the

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,000
auditorium in person. We have multiple

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,320
overflow rooms at the broad for inerson

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,879
attendance and we have over 500

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,680
attendees um joining us virtually today.

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,600
So we are um a thousand attendees this

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,680
year which is just along the track

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,239
record of previous variant to function

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,359
symposia um joining from all over the

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,399
world spanning academia industry venture

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,000
capitalism and beyond and that kind of

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,159
scale and reach and diversity um is

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,360
really what makes our community powerful

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,080
I think and I'm um filled with joy and

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,400
pride and excitement about um about

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,119
that. So this symposium as the previous

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,439
um symposia um of V2F here at the broad

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,759
is hosted by the Nova Norris Foundation

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,920
Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,400
which is a bridgeet center focused on

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,400
bridging science and innovation for

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,280
translation in the metabolic disease

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,360
space and really for connecting Danish

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
science with scientists here at the

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,200
Broad Institute and as a matter of fact

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,079
we had 45 Danish collaborators flying in

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
over the last two days here to join us

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,399
for our variant to function symposium

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,720
and the annual NNF center symposium and

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,720
I just want to say the warmest welcome

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
to those I haven't given a hug yet and

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,560
I'm so excited that you are here um and

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,040
for the coming days ahead

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,520
I will just say Bridget Center or bridge

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,600
building um I'm going to pause and say

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,679
as an academic in the United States

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,400
where science and so much more is under

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,840
attack bridge building I'm very fond of

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
bridge building I've always been fond of

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
bridge buildingilding But I'm

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,360
particularly fond of bridge building um

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,319
these days and I think bridge building

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,040
across institutions um across the globe

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,360
really between academia and industry

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,280
this um between science and the public

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,080
for increased science communication

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,239
towards the public and bridge building

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
across scientific disciplines has become

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,360
so important and the bridging of

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,440
scientific disciplines. I think the V2F

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,920
um field really is a stellar example

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,080
that has showcased over and over again

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,959
that the bridging of different

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
expertises, clinicians, biologists,

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,160
mathematicians, computer scientists,

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,239
geneticists, patients, and so forth make

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,760
the difference and can have an enormous

70
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,400
impact.

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,040
So, let's think today as an as a day of

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
bridge building. Reach out to somebody

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,519
um with expertise outside of your

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,599
comfort zone. Don't lay back but e

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,680
engage actively in the discussion. I

76
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,480
think Eric Lander and Mark Bailey have

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,560
done a great job last year with their

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,879
keynote discussion rather than a keynote

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
lecture in the sense of this isn't a

80
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,360
dialogue. We have to advance the field

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,319
um together um as we are moving forward.

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,080
also post on social media so we can

83
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
engage in discussion with the outside

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
world even beyond the attendees of this

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
symposium and actively contribute to

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,680
science communication towards the

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,239
public. Um great we have more people

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,799
trickling in which is lovely. I have the

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,799
great honor now to thank the most um

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,640
important contributors for today and I'm

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,040
going to start with Kasper Le who's here

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,799
right in in the front seat. Kasper has

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
been co-chairing the varant to function

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,200
symposium with me from the get-go which

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,280
has been an enormous pleasure. Kasper is

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,439
man the man managing director of the

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,760
noonautus foundation center of genomic

98
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,879
medicines here at the broad um and I

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
think I speak on behalf of the

100
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,120
leadership that we are very care um

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,599
grateful for your careful shephering and

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm also really grateful for your faith

103
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,760
and the support in continuing to embark

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,959
on variant to function as one of the

105
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,680
guiding principles for our center. So

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,680
let's give an appro

107
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,680
and I and I will say that the welcome

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,800
remarks are on behalf of both of us as

109
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,360
we want to thank particularly so our

110
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,160
generous host the Nova Nordis Foundation

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,479
and particularly so Tanya Peterson. Oh

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,800
there there you are lovely. Um and

113
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,000
Christina Williamson our contact persons

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,639
at the um at the foundation. It's so

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,240
lovely to see you as usual. An enormous

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,080
pleasure to interact with you and I'm

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
very much looking forward to collecting

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,759
this week and to discussing science and

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
beyond. And this here's actually a

120
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,040
picture from your last visit at the

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,680
broad in the genomics platform. Um,

122
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,479
arguably most importantly, a huge thank

123
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,199
you and shout out to the cent's admin

124
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,880
and operations team led by Anika Vimma

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,080
and multiple other attendees, but

126
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,000
particularly so Carly Croano, who has

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,639
tirelessly worked on organizing and

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,320
preparing for this event, the symposia,

129
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
they don't just happen. There's a lot of

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,800
unseen work in the background. I would

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,479
love us to um clap and give a huge

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,600
applause to both Christina, Tanya and as

133
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,600
well as Scarlet and Anica.

134
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,080
We are very grateful. So, um I'm also

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,919
going to give a a shout out to Todd

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,440
Golat, the BRS director, and thank him

137
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,840
for his strong support and guidance

138
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,919
along the way. and to Eric Lander who

139
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,720
cannot join today because he's

140
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,639
celebrating with um the family um the

141
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,160
Jewish New Year. Happy Jewish New Year

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,919
to all of those who are celebrating um

143
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,759
um and and your families. Of course,

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,720
Eric has been arguably so one of the

145
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,560
earliest advocates and supporters for

146
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,720
variant to function and the variant to

147
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,759
function initiative um here at the broad

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,560
institute as he has asked me along with

149
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,479
Jesse Angright's Navi Frag initially to

150
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,960
launch a broad internal variant to

151
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,199
function initiative in 2017 which has

152
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,039
been an enormous pleasure and I'm really

153
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,880
um excited that Jesse is not only here

154
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,720
in person today but he's also going to

155
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,000
share his continuing amazing work in the

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,720
V2F space later today in this symposium.

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,639
The V2F story for me um is a personal

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,479
one. Growing up in the Alps, I really

159
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
have never imagined I actually grew up

160
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,520
on a farm that I would spend my career

161
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,840
connecting genetic varants to disease

162
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,840
biology in the context of cardioabolic

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,280
disease. But in back in 2007 when the

164
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,000
first you know waves of jas just hit us

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,840
as a community, I attended a symposium

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,800
in Munich and Thomas El was there and

167
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,360
Thomas is one of the or was one of the

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
um senior um authors on the diagram

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,039
consortium investigators who was part of

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,520
the 2007 um um largest genomide

171
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,440
association study back then for or first

172
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,400
genome association study for type 2

173
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,000
diabetes um published in Nature. and he

174
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,160
described the challenge. He said what's

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
expected is that these JVA signals for

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
diabetes they appear they come in LD

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
blocks because of the HL type structure

178
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,319
of the human genome. But what probably

179
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,560
not everyone has expected is that the

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,800
largest chunk of these signals is in the

181
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,400
non-coding part of the genome. That

182
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,880
problem in 2007 hooked me. I took on a

183
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,039
PhD project with Thomas and Hansa at the

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,680
Helmhold Center and develop a

185
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,080
computational and experimental strategy

186
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,960
um for my PhD thesis in the variant to

187
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,520
function um context to predict which

188
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,160
regulatory varants would be um

189
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,599
functional and and related to type two

190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,639
diabetes progression and manifestation.

191
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,639
So I'm I'm saying this it actually took

192
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,440
seven years um until this work got

193
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,080
published in in cell which is just an

194
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,840
indication of um how long variant of

195
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,560
function studies particularly in the

196
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,199
past have taken um and that is being

197
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
changed drastically now.

198
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,120
The point I wanted to make is that at

199
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,520
the time I could hardly imagine that we

200
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
would be at one point able to trace the

201
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
full path from genetic maps through

202
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,000
mechanisms through um to medicines and

203
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,319
yet that's exactly what the field has

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,520
embarked on and making possible and I

205
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,479
think speakers today like the tray bas

206
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,599
George Church VJ Sankaran with his um as

207
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,240
one of our variant to function pioneers

208
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,560
um seeing his um V2F target moving all

209
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,600
the way into the clinic Ben Kleinstever

210
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,920
and others others are um definitely

211
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
examples of the success that genetic

212
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,160
information can be moved through the

213
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,040
angle of mechanisms all the way down um

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,360
to medicines to to treat patients and

215
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,399
with that other than in the previous two

216
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,279
years we launched the um um V2F

217
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,279
symposium open to the public in 2023

218
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,880
where we focused on genetic discovery

219
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,240
and gene regulation and cellular

220
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,320
phenotyping. In 2024, we then doubled

221
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,880
down on technology development for

222
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,040
scaling variant interpretations.

223
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,760
Um that was last year along with a

224
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,080
fantastic keynote um shared between Mark

225
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,720
Daly and Eric Lander on where human

226
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,360
genetics um future um or where they are

227
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,240
seeing the the future of human genetics.

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,920
This year we are um our focus is

229
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
twofold. On the one side, we will

230
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
continue and double down on scaling

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,480
variant interpretation on the along the

232
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,880
axis of biology being gene regulation

233
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,720
and cellular programs and on the other

234
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
time on the other side for the first

235
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
time we're going to reach towards

236
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,480
translation and connecting these

237
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,959
insights to therapeutic um hypothesis

238
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
and speakers like um Robert Plench I'm

239
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,279
so excited that you are with us here

240
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,920
today. VJ Sankaran and Blank Kleinstea

241
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,000
are light, you know, northern lights in

242
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,040
this path to literally leveraging

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,519
genetics to actually um translate um

244
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,640
information into the clinic.

245
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,120
Now, since this year's theme is very

246
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,600
much about reaching towards translation,

247
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,000
it's worth pausing and asking what

248
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
actually makes a good drug. And I

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,640
borrowed here an analogy from Matt

250
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,120
Nelson, the CEO of Jensenians, who has

251
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,200
given a fantastic keynote lecture at our

252
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,640
MPG seminar at the Broad earlier this

253
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,480
year. Um I'm actually coming this to um

254
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,560
um to this in a moment. Sorry. For now,

255
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm just going to um make the point that

256
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,120
at the basic level, what makes a good

257
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,959
drug? We can say it makes um it's

258
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,440
important that it actually works in

259
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,120
humans, ideally, not only in mice. For

260
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,279
the intended disease indication, it

261
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,200
needs to be safe. Of course it has to

262
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,200
reach the right place and the right dose

263
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,959
and it needs to be selective targeting

264
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
the right mechanism with not too many

265
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,240
offtarget effects right and for the

266
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
future. So um the the notion is

267
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,040
definitely that it has to be

268
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
mechanistically anchored in human

269
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,760
genetics and biology so we have causal

270
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
evidence in hand for a given target and

271
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,480
differentiate and ideally tailor to

272
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,920
patient subgroups. And here's where I'm

273
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,000
going to borrow Matt Nelson's analogy um

274
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,399
that he presented at the MPG retreat

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,640
earlier this year. He compares it to

276
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,279
space exploration which itself is

277
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,760
ambitious, risky, expensive and has a

278
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,079
high failure rate. But he makes the

279
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,600
point um a very valid one that there's

280
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,480
an estimated more than two um2 billion

281
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,560
US dollars per commercial launch which

282
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,959
means as he calculated that we can fund

283
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,279
roughly 25 Falcon Heavy space launches

284
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,160
for the cost of launching just a single

285
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,800
successful drug. That's I mean we just

286
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,760
have to pause and realize that bringing

287
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,160
a given target to the market and

288
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,880
treating patients is an enormous

289
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,360
expensive effort. Now what's the problem

290
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,959
here? The high failure rate um I just

291
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,440
discussed this this morning with church

292
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,079
together too is on the one side the

293
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
problem of innovation in that many of

294
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,560
these medicines they fail to major

295
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,320
improvements above the standard of care

296
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,120
since they are often targeting similar

297
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
pathways. On the other side, and I'm

298
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,279
sure Robert will talk about this later

299
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,279
um this afternoon, it's a problem of

300
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,279
attrition and the attrition problem

301
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,680
particularly factors in in late stages

302
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,079
of clinical trials in phases two and

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,000
three which drive the high ro costs in

304
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,440
drug development.

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,959
That being said, I love this um recent

306
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,800
um um you know work that um Matt Nelson

307
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,120
and Eric Minl published in Nature last

308
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,680
year where they basically looked at the

309
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,760
estimated relative success for a given

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,639
for for a set of targets supported by

311
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,279
genetics compared to controls across the

312
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,880
different phases of clinical translation

313
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,880
and across a whole number of different

314
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,800
disease indications. And what we can

315
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,800
draw from here which this community is

316
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
very well aware of is that genetics

317
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,880
absolutely matter. Genetic support

318
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
increases the likelihood for a given

319
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,040
target to end up in the clinic by two to

320
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,600
eightfold. But the particularly

321
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,839
important point here is that the p um

322
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
that the most um critical impact is

323
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,680
actually in the late stages of clinical

324
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,920
trials in phase two and three where

325
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,760
exactly this attrition problem of

326
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,560
failure at the level of efficacy and

327
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,800
safety kicks in. So you know thinking

328
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,839
about genetics as the foundation is a

329
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,839
very meaningful concept. Now we have

330
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,320
talked about this iteratively over the

331
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,040
last two years. Human genetics has been

332
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,880
incredibly successful to identifying

333
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,200
hundreds of thousands of genetic regions

334
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,440
in the human genome that associate with

335
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,120
the whole um series of different traits

336
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,279
and diseases relevant um to humanity. Um

337
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,880
not only diseases and traits but also we

338
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,360
can start mapping disease progression.

339
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,600
we can start parsing individual like

340
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,760
large clusters of disease into subtypes

341
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
and endoypes of disease. It's an

342
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,519
incredibly exciting space and

343
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,560
particularly so with um increasing cross

344
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
bioank analyses as for example the Bravo

345
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
consortium is undertaking in the rare

346
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
variant space. I think Ben Neil is here

347
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
and we'll um chair a session later. Hi,

348
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,880
lovely to see you and the global bio

349
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,040
bank meter analysis are spearheading

350
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,519
examples of exactly what has to happen

351
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,839
right now which is the meta analysis of

352
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,120
large large bio banks across the globe

353
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,440
such as the GBMI undertakes and meta

354
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,680
analysis 24 biioanks across more than

355
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,519
two million individuals to come up with

356
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,079
robust signals and really drive us

357
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,720
towards saturation and lay out the map

358
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,800
of genetic associations with disease. We

359
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,199
can say that genetic discovery itself

360
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,040
from first principles is a solved

361
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,480
problem. It still has we have to double

362
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,120
down on it and we have to reach

363
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,040
saturation but we know how to do it very

364
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,240
very well and we have an enormous amount

365
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,760
of um genetic signals to work with. The

366
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,279
challenge is a different one that's the

367
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,519
reason that we are coming here together

368
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,360
every year where you know we are looking

369
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,440
at these robust maps between genetic

370
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,839
variation and disease and traits in

371
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,680
humans. And I like to say, you have

372
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,120
heard me saying this um for those who

373
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,440
have um um um you know been at um some

374
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,199
of my previous talks that this is to me

375
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,480
the foundation for targets and

376
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,920
mechanisms of actions that are

377
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,720
actionable towards therapeutic

378
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,120
translation. This middle the mechanisms

379
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
um that enable the translation. But

380
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,279
that's exactly this prosecution of

381
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,600
genetic signals to disease driving or

382
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,079
disease modifying biology is what's

383
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,920
lagging behind. the biological interpret

384
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,639
um interpretation is drastically lagging

385
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,560
behind. So one could argue that one of

386
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,000
the grandest challenges in human health

387
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,760
is the scalable mechanistic

388
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
interpretation of genetic data to lay

389
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,800
the foundation for rationally designed

390
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,199
um medicines. And I thought I'm going to

391
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,839
quickly walk you through a few of the

392
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,680
challenges that continue to exist in the

393
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,680
community and that we have to continue

394
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,160
work on and that are being touched on

395
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,279
throughout the diverse talks we have um

396
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,199
in this day and also an enormously um

397
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,480
exciting poster session at the end of

398
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,720
the day.

399
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,120
One of the challenges has always been

400
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,079
and still is I shared with you my story

401
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,240
how I started my PhD is the fact that

402
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,480
the majority of these um common genetic

403
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,279
signals are located in the non-coding um

404
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,120
genome in the form of um LD blocks that

405
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,959
have fine map to some extent but still

406
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,360
in many cases we are not sure what the

407
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,040
causal disease driving varants are which

408
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,199
target genes they are and which pathways

409
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,920
they implicate we will have a lot of

410
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,560
talks focused on this today bridging

411
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,519
this gap requires And that's a challenge

412
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,440
in itself to work with disease truceful

413
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
cellular models that respond in disease

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,320
relevant ways. So we have to turn oursel

415
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,680
and really critically evaluate actually

416
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,360
are we actually working with the right

417
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,480
cellar model systems. Are we working

418
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,120
with a set of stimulations or are we

419
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,360
assessing invivo physiology in a way

420
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,519
that is recapulating at least a large

421
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,199
fraction of disease pathophysiological

422
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,759
processes.

423
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,160
We also need which is rarely existing in

424
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,480
the community matched multimodal data

425
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,120
sets across truth uh these kind of

426
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,680
truthful disease cellar model systems

427
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,280
that let us um that let us

428
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,480
systematically interrogate disease

429
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,559
biology as it progresses over um over

430
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,559
the pathophysiological events of a given

431
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,559
disease.

432
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,799
We also need um

433
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
sorry I've been tested negative for

434
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,039
COVID and flu but I've been down sick

435
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,439
for a couple of um over the weekend and

436
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,439
I'm have finally recovered for

437
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,439
fortunately.

438
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:37,679
So a challenge also is we need scalable

439
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,559
highdimensional readouts that capture

440
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,320
both regulatory and phenotypic effects

441
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,559
across across all of these different

442
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,960
phenotypic modalities that um are in

443
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,720
coordinated ways impacting biology

444
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,440
related to disease. And and this is an

445
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,960
incredibly exciting space to watch. We

446
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,720
need and there's an enormous involvement

447
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,640
of these data that are currently being

448
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,679
developed to fuel the next generation of

449
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,880
statistical models. You hear Beu today

450
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,480
to talk about her Sage QTL dynamic um

451
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,160
modeling framework at single cell

452
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,320
resolution um only possible because of

453
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,559
data that are currently being developed

454
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,120
in the community. We we are looking at

455
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,679
every day a new um phenomenal

456
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,160
sequence-based model hitting um hitting

457
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,919
the rubber and and being available to

458
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,559
the community. We have Johannes Lintner

459
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,280
today um presenting on the Bourzo um

460
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,960
model. There are many many more that are

461
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,039
currently being trained on a diversity

462
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,320
of different data sets which is an

463
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,880
exciting space. I'll also say that um

464
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,360
Eric and Mark in in their keynote um

465
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,120
discussion last year, they have called

466
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
for the importance of com um

467
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,760
comprehensively cataloging effects of

468
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,840
effective gene modulation through a

469
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,640
large set of ptopsic experiments across

470
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,880
a wide range of primary disease models

471
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,240
and Elisa Donard a phenomenal group

472
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,480
leader here at the broad in in the

473
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,799
Lander lab has taken on that challenge

474
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,080
to wrangle the groups. Um we are lucky

475
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,160
enough to be part of that um effort to

476
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,080
um get together the community in the

477
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,799
disease space and really think about how

478
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,600
can we systematically perturb thousands

479
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,240
of targets in a harmonized manner um

480
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,440
with readouts that not only stop at um

481
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,520
the at um at the RNA level but also fold

482
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,280
in multiplex site seek readouts and and

483
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,799
optical information through high content

484
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
imaging that many of you know we are

485
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,480
really fond of to develop data sets that

486
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,799
enable us to um develop um the next

487
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,960
generation of computational models that

488
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,440
would be able to identify you know sets

489
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,120
of GBA hits that converge on the on the

490
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,080
same functional pathways for for

491
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,080
example. And finally I think a space

492
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,760
that is incredibly exciting to think

493
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,520
about is ways um that are often called

494
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,360
or the strategy is often called jvas

495
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
nadish where we are looking at

496
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,679
systematically mapping genetic variation

497
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,559
to disease-driving biology in these

498
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,559
truthful patient models. The idea was

499
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,880
incubated as part of the international

500
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,039
common disease alliance um together with

501
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,679
Gha Trinka at the Sanger and and many

502
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,320
others in the community um and called

503
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,160
the cell map framework where the idea

504
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,480
here I'm going to just include two

505
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,480
slides of results on our end in in my

506
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
lab where we are you know have these

507
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,080
truthful primary patient samples we are

508
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,960
pulling them together and then reading

509
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,120
out across multiple diff different um

510
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,919
phenotypic modalities to capture the

511
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,120
full pro um um propagation of biological

512
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,799
information in the cell as it is as the

513
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,520
cell is exposed to disease relevant

514
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,559
stimulatory conditions. The reason I

515
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,440
wanted to include this slide is to show

516
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,880
you um two nuggets of what we can start

517
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,120
drawing from it which I think is

518
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,799
exciting in just um a sample size of 118

519
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,960
donors of subcutaneous primary

520
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,360
adiposytes exposed to a series of

521
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,280
different stimulatory condition and

522
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,840
reading out with 10x multi ohm the

523
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,039
single nuclei chromatin accessibility as

524
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,720
well as RNA and using our im metabolic

525
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,679
disease oriented highdimensional

526
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,679
imagebased profiling liposy profiler, we

527
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,520
can start seeing LOSI through a

528
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,320
stringent collocicalization framework

529
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,320
like this one here that um robustly

530
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,679
associates with fat distribution and you

531
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,080
can start tracking the full um the full

532
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,720
path of how genetic variation acts on

533
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,760
chromatin accessibility connects it to a

534
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,120
collocicalized expression QTL and to an

535
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,880
image QTL to you know um make the path

536
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,960
and the connection of genetic variation

537
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,799
impact not only on gene regulation but

538
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,520
also downstream pheno types that relate

539
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,400
to disease biology. When we look to

540
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,080
nomite um in these 118 donors across the

541
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,640
different disease relevant stimul um

542
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,799
stimulatory condition and adopocytes we

543
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
can then ask for the collocicalization

544
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,280
rate across metabolic disease traits. I

545
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,240
have a set of examples here like fat

546
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,320
distribution, insulin sensitive um um

547
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,640
insulin resistance and glucose meastas

548
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
and lipid hemasis and you can

549
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,600
acknowledge that roughly 10% for LDL

550
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,320
where subcutaneous codiposytes are not

551
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,360
expected to play a major role um but up

552
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,360
to 80% of these ja signal appear to

553
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,720
collocicalize with any of these

554
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,280
molecular QTLs coming from um um attack

555
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,400
RNA or image space profiling. Huge shout

556
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,960
out here to Hzam Dashki and Yu um um

557
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,120
Wang in my lab um fantastic scientists

558
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,600
and and he is a postoc who have put

559
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,240
together these very recent data sets um

560
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,720
on a short notice. I also want to shout

561
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,360
out to Sophia Mets a great postoc in the

562
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,960
center um co-advised by Camila Sheila

563
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,440
and myself and and previously with

564
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,120
Thomas Kilpen um if you are interested

565
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,679
in reading a really good variant of

566
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,919
function review in the adopite space

567
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,520
please um look at this one. It's a it's

568
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,880
a great one. Okay. So, what's new and

569
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,440
coming in vibrarian to functional

570
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,640
research? Just quick notes on the one

571
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,640
side context. We learned that um Thank

572
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,039
you. We learned that context really

573
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,960
matters enormously enormously disease

574
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,480
stimulation context. Particularly

575
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,480
whether it's nutrient signaling,

576
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,480
inflammatory cures or hypoxia, the

577
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,320
cellar environment matters to unfold and

578
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
manifest variant effects. That's what

579
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
the community over and over finds these

580
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,200
days and it's is important to factor in.

581
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,320
We need to read out biology across

582
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,000
multiple phenotypic scales. We are also

583
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,080
and that's the second point here. We are

584
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,400
entering a bioank scale era of molecular

585
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,880
phenotypes where the 10k 10k um

586
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,840
consortium for example but also the UK

587
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,720
bio bank and finen are now ramping up um

588
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,640
to basically map 10xmotium for example

589
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
along with metabolomics and proteomics

590
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,200
in tens of thousands of individuals that

591
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,640
will um you know that will be available

592
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,039
to the community and make a huge

593
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,120
different in interpretation.

594
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,440
I also think that this point here from

595
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,679
gene centric to program centric view um

596
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,240
which my lab is embarking on a lot

597
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,720
currently is is an important one where

598
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,440
we are moving beyond linear gas um

599
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,200
variant to gene um kind of translation

600
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,039
and going more and more along the notion

601
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,799
that a lot of these lossi they act

602
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,400
through coordinated polygenic cellar

603
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,559
programs and mapping these cellar

604
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,039
programs um paves the way to um identify

605
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,520
patient subgroups towards therapies and

606
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,760
then there's of course AI I that's two

607
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,320
that's a bucket that is exploding at the

608
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,120
moment. I just saw from Jong Soo earlier

609
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,480
yesterday their new GPN model which is

610
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,720
seems to be at least from the first

611
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
glance phenomenal in terms of enrichment

612
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,720
of sniper heritability. There's one

613
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,039
model after the other being developed

614
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,200
and trained by increasingly you know

615
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,880
better um data in the sense that they

616
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,600
capture disease biology better and

617
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
better which is an exciting space. I'm

618
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,520
very fond of the iterative lab in the

619
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,200
loop model where we are working with

620
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,880
challenges in machine learning and

621
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
thinking about how do we have to design

622
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,600
an experiment to then um um develop a

623
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,480
model and go back to improve and refine

624
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,400
the model itself in order um by by

625
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,240
designing an experiment that is um

626
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,760
ideally suited for addressing exactly

627
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,679
that problem. And then finally uh um the

628
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,440
translation piece where of course the

629
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,760
patient specific invivo gene editing

630
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,919
through base editors earlier this year

631
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,000
has um is one of the examples that is

632
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,480
just so incredibly exciting to witness

633
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,480
in our field and we have Ben Kleinstea

634
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,159
who has has been involved in this study

635
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,240
and in this work in this space with such

636
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,640
an enormous track record today um

637
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,320
speaking to us. Okay. So the sessions um

638
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
um very quickly going through them

639
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,080
addressing multiple of these challenge

640
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,760
that I laid out. We are going to start

641
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,520
with scaling variant interpretation

642
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,919
shared by diet de Montes and have

643
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,480
exciting talks from Ruth Los um Jason

644
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,240
Flanick and Bezu focus on the question

645
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,400
how do we move from millions of variants

646
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,440
to interpretable maps and disease endo

647
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,440
types at scale. We are then moving on to

648
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,760
the gene regulation session chair Pred

649
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,919
Bernstein um along with exciting talk

650
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,640
from Yesper Martin and Jesse Angrites in

651
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,240
in our center um focused on decoding the

652
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,440
regulatory architecture that connects

653
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,360
variance to a factor genes and then I

654
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,279
think after lunch we are decoding

655
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,840
variant effect through cellar models

656
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,760
shared by two pairs with exciting talks

657
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,559
from Khloe Vani who is co-leading the

658
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,039
human cell atlas um and Johannes Lindner

659
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,400
um who is um um or has been in David

660
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,400
Kelly's that and develop Boroy, a really

661
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,760
um intriguing machine learning model.

662
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,520
And finally, the last session is

663
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,880
translating variance into therapeutic

664
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,279
int um um insights shared by our very

665
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,039
own Ben Neil and the speakers. And I'm

666
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,159
so excited, VJ, that you could make it

667
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,240
this year. I don't know where you're

668
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,880
sitting right now, but I'm I'm really

669
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,039
looking forward to hearing you as as one

670
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,880
of the V2F pioneers and seeing through

671
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,840
all the way to clinical implementation

672
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,120
of your um of your work as well as blank

673
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,760
bl Ben blank client steiver who I've

674
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,240
praised earlier. Casper I know will do a

675
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,120
phenomenal job at introducing Robert. So

676
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,440
I'm leaving that um to Casper very much

677
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,120
looking forward to um um to the talk. So

678
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,200
this is kind of the full arc that we are

679
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,039
spending today. Um, I'm not going to

680
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,960
repeat all of the different parts, but

681
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,360
we'll just say the whole is greater than

682
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,440
the sum of its parts. I'm just including

683
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,840
here a few icons. I was sick when I made

684
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,760
this, so there's a lot of um gaps in

685
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,640
this in this slide. I apologize for it.

686
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,520
The point I wanted to make is this needs

687
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,200
um this needs bridge building. The V2F

688
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,520
field continues to need bridge building.

689
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,000
This is why we are so strong. along with

690
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,240
our B2F symposium hosted by the NNF

691
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,559
center. I also want to shout out in the

692
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,400
spirit of um bridge building that the

693
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,880
welcome connecting science is launching

694
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,400
the biology of um of scale conference

695
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,679
series next year at the welcomecom

696
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,679
compass. That's a um symposia that um

697
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,919
Gosha Trinka, Craig Lassenbury, Jonathan

698
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,240
Pritchard and myself have put together

699
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,080
focused on developing and thinking how

700
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,320
we can measure and model biology at

701
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,360
scale through new tools and technologies

702
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,000
ma um combined with um um with

703
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,000
computational strategies.
