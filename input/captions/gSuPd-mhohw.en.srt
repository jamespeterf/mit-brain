1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,000
okay so now you're familiar with the

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,720
clinical samples that you will be

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,640
working with over the course of these

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,120
three crunches during the uh machine

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,719
learning Challenge and now let's look at

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,400
how the data is structured and how it

7
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,000
will be provided to

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,840
you so uh for the spatial

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,519
transcriptomics measurements here we're

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,519
showing uh tissue sections sitting on

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,039
the zenium slide and here we're showing

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,439
uh the spal transcript omics data itself

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,680
all 480 genes where each dot is a

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,200
transcript or one of those 480 genes and

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,120
on the right we're showing the

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,239
corresponding h& image and so you will

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,480
be getting paired data like this for all

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,480
eight of these clinical

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,480
samples and now let's talk a little bit

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,120
about how we chose to design these

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,840
experiments so at some point you might

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,440
have wondered well or is saying we've

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,079
measured 480 genes here how are those

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,079
480 genes chosen remember there's 20,000

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,760
genes in the human genome and we didn't

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,119
just flip coins to choose these genes uh

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,320
actually what we did was we looked first

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,520
of all for genes that are specifically

29
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,720
expressed in cell types found in the

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
colon so a gene like epcam which you

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,200
remember Mark marks epithelial cells

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
that's specifically expressed in

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
epithelial cells in the colon is going

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,159
to tell us about those types of cells so

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
that's a gene we chose um so we did that

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,439
for many many cell types and chose genes

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,119
that Mark those cell types we also chose

38
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,240
genes that have a known genetic

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,159
association with ulcerative colitis and

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,240
what that means is that patients who

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,439
have ulcerative colitis they tend to

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,799
have specific genetic variant that

43
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,320
increase their risk for ulcerative

44
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,560
colitis so we think those specific genes

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,240
are important in the pathogenesis the

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,320
disease mechanism of ulcerative colitis

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,560
finally we chose genes that are involved

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,799
in cellto cell signaling so this is uh

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
what what cellto cell signaling is

50
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,000
really is just one cell sends a signal

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
to another cell and that cell responds

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,479
and that's something that spatial

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,759
transcriptomic gives us unique power to

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,520
look at because to look at a cell that's

55
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,080
sending a signal and a cell that's

56
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,599
receiving a signal we really want to

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
know where they are in space so the cell

58
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,560
signaling is very important to us and we

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,280
know that cell signaling drives

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,840
inflammation so that's another uh set of

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,680
genes that we kind of pulled from or

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,760
ones involved in cell cell

63
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,440
signaling and then the next question you

64
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,760
have is okay what are the data types

65
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,959
provided so we're going to give you

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,760
hystology images um prepared by uh

67
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,480
prepared by us we're also going to give

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,480
you the zenium data itself the zenium

69
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,640
spatial transcriptomic data that will be

70
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,640
Gene transcript locations in the

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,040
assignment of those transcripts to cells

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,879
and then finally we're going to give you

73
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,959
the segmentation masks and the

74
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,840
segmentation mask to remind you is going

75
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,560
to be a boundary that goes around every

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,800
single cell and it will tell us where

77
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,200
the cells are and which transcripts are

78
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,200
in those cells and ultimately for every

79
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,280
tissue that we give you every tissue

80
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,280
section there's hundreds of thousands of

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,319
cells like typically there's three or

82
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,680
400,000 cells that are being profiled in

83
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:11,239
a single ZM spatial transcript omic data

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,480
set okay so how is the data going to be

85
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,319
provided to you so we've structured it

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,239
using open-source python packages so

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,560
zenium data is uh actually quite

88
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,560
complicated there's many data types that

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,599
are needed to fully Express the data so

90
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,400
we're going to be providing to you the

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,760
data in an object that can be um open in

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,760
the spatial data python pack package and

93
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,840
spatial data is a really new framework

94
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,879
that came out this year for the storage

95
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,400
and process of a multimodal spatial loic

96
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,040
data and this allows you to store images

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,000
points labels shapes and tables so

98
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,239
images would be things like the h& image

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
uh points would be like the transcript

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,159
location uh shapes will be the

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,519
segmentation masks and labels and tables

102
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,560
are uh essentially metadata that we can

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,840
use to annotate the features in the

104
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,760
spatial transcript doic data and so

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,200
spatial data is really meant for it's

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,799
really a package meant for reading in

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,879
the data and organizing it in this

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
really beautiful modular way and if you

109
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,200
want to do analysis on the data there's

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
another package that works seamlessly

111
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,159
with spatial data called squid pie and

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,879
we encourage you to check that out as

113
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,799
well so that's how the data will be

114
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,000
structured and organized and you'll get

115
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,199
these eight spatial data objects one for

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
each clinical

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,120
sample now there's also the Single Cell

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,400
transcript omix data and there's two

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
single cell transcript omix data sets

120
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,160
we're going to be providing you with one

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,840
for crunch 2 and one for crunch 3 and

122
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,400
remember the Single Cell transcript omic

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,160
data is going to give us expression

124
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,560
measurements for all 20,000 genes and we

125
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,759
know that different cell types Express

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,400
different gene expression programs so

127
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,320
one data set will be giving you is one

128
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,240
that we already introduced from lecture

129
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,880
two this is the one collected by uh Dr

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,000
Ron mavier where his group profiled

131
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,720
ulcerative colitis tissue and did single

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,560
cell transcriptomics and so there's

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
information on immune cells in

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,520
epithelial cells in stromal cells which

135
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,759
make up connective tissue in the colon

136
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,759
we will also provide you data sets

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
collected from colon muscle and the

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,320
colon nervous system and we provide

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,560
these as well because these uh represent

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,919
cell types that are not found in this

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,400
first space uh single cell

142
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,800
transcriptomic data set so with these

143
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,000
data sets you'll have representatives of

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,160
all cell types that are found in

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,720
ulcerative colitis

146
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,759
colon we'll also provide you with

147
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,919
metadata for every single sample and

148
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,000
this metadata tells us whether the

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,800
tissue came from a healthy individual or

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,479
whether it came from a non-inflamed part

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
of the colon or an inflamed part of the

152
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,520
colon and this is helpful because you

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
are probably going to be most interested

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,479
in those pieces that are from the

155
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
inflamed colon because that's going to

156
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,680
tell us about the inflammation programs

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,520
but having the healthy there provides a

158
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,160
point of comparison so you can really

159
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,440
look at what genes are differentiating

160
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,800
inflame from healthy colon

161
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,720
and then the last single cell

162
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,080
transcriptomics data set we're going to

163
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,160
provide you comes from a study that was

164
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
made looking at the coloral Cancer

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
Continuum so this was a study carried

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,039
out by William Greenleaf and Michael

167
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,360
Snider at Stanford University and they

168
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,280
collected samples from healthy colon

169
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,599
from adomus polyps or precancer and from

170
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,199
colar rectal cancer so polyps are

171
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,360
abnormal growth of the colon epithelial

172
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,400
cell lining into the center of the colon

173
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,880
tube and sometimes they look like um

174
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,599
mushrooms or kind of just these

175
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,440
projections inward into the colon and so

176
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,800
the polyps themselves also have

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,199
displasia in them so within the polyps

178
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,440
there's usually or often abnormal growth

179
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,520
of epithelial cells so this is a good

180
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,639
data set where we can actually look at

181
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,120
what displasia looks like at the Single

182
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,479
Cell transcriptomic level so in their

183
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,759
data they collected samples from healthy

184
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,080
colon from colorl cancer and from these

185
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,560
polyps which often have dysplasia in

186
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,520
them and we have epithelial cells immune

187
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,000
cells and the stromal cells which again

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,319
make up the connective

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,440
tissue and we have a lot of metadata

190
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,800
provided here uh first we have what kind

191
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,520
of what's the status of the tissue

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,560
whether there's a polyp whether it's

193
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,720
fully progressed to cancer it's an adoc

194
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,280
carcinoma a type of cancer or whether

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,039
it's just healthy so we call that normal

196
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,639
or unaffected in addition we have the

197
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,039
diagnosis of displasia from a

198
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,120
pathologist so we know which pieces of

199
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,599
tissue have displasia in them and that's

200
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,879
going to be important for crunch 3 where

201
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,520
we're focus on displasia and then

202
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,000
finally you know one thing you might

203
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,840
want to focus on as you use this data is

204
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,360
to focus on those pops where there is

205
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,000
diagnosed displasia by the pathologist

206
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,360
so that's going to give you single cell

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
data from displasia

208
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,840
samples so uh when you're working with

209
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,759
single cell data there's a lot of

210
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,879
packages out there but we have structure

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
the single cell transcriptomic data such

212
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,080
that you can load it again in another

213
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,840
open source python package called and

214
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,080
data this is a way to uh store the data

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,560
the gene expression count matrices in

216
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,440
matrices and also have annotation for

217
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,599
those matrices and then there's another

218
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,240
package called scanpy which you can use

219
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,840
to carry out analysis of uh the

220
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,280
different single cell data sets and so

221
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,800
this is going to be uh very useful for

222
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,599
working with a single cell data and

223
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,240
what's nice is um these packages all

224
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,759
cooperate very well with the spatial

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,280
data package that I introduced uh to you

226
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,800
a few slides ear which you're going to

227
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,800
use to work uh to work on with the

228
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,800
spatial transcriptomic data
