00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
hello I'm L hessie Fisher and you're

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,880
listening to today I learned climate

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,880
from the Massachusetts Institute of

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,960
Technology imagine for a moment that

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:22,800
you're standing on a massive sheet of

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,599
ice that spans from the high Arctic all

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,720
the way into the northern United States

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,199
at its thickest point you could drill

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,239
down through almost 2 miles s of solid

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,640
ice before reaching

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,120
land today on our episode we are going

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,559
back in time to visit past versions of

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,000
our Earth that are wildly different from

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,840
today's and why well because the earth's

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,399
climate has changed before many times

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,280
before and folks like you have written

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,920
in and asked us about it what caused the

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
earth's climate to change in the past

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,760
and what can it tell us about the

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,640
climate change that we're experiencing

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,119
today fortunately we know someone at MIT

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,680
who knows a lot about the history of the

23
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,360
earth's climate my name is David McGee

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,479
and I'm a professor in the department of

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,520
Earth atmospheric and planetary Sciences

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,560
at MIT and I study paleoclimate which is

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
the study of the natural history of

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,439
Earth's

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,479
climate it turns out that our planet has

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,400
changed a lot before we humans came onto

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,360
the scene there was a time for instance

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,159
when the the whole center of North

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,479
America was engulfed by an inland sea a

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,439
time when alligators crawled in the

35
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,320
Arctic and forests flourished near the

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,040
South Pole and that's because the Earth

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,280
has gone through some wild changes in

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,200
temperature even in the last 1% of Earth

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,840
history so the last like 45 million

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,280
years we've seen changes in the earth's

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,159
mean

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:05,439
temperature of roughly 30 to 40° F so

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,000
huge changes in the mean Global

44
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,800
temperature but how do we know about

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,160
these big changes in temperature well

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,040
that really is the story of paleo

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,879
climate and it begins in Earnest in the

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,840
1700s with some peculiar

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,360
rocks people had noticed Boulders that

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,519
didn't match the local bedrock in places

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,080
where it didn't really make sense that

52
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,560
there should be Boulders in Scotland and

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,000
Ireland around eastern North America

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,159
they noticed striations or grooves in

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,920
the Bedrock and they realized that these

56
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,080
striations were things that were

57
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
observed near modern glaciers and so

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,519
people started to piece together this

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,239
story that there had been very large ice

60
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,400
sheets in places where there weren't

61
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,640
currently ice

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,319
sheets in 1824 a geologist named yenes

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,080
Mark first proposed that these ice

64
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,239
sheets were not just local but a single

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,239
vast mass of ice that once covered much

66
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,879
of the northern hemisphere in other

67
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,159
words that the world had undergone an

68
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,120
Ice

69
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,200
Age over the next Century scientists

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,080
would find more and more evidence

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,080
proving his theory eventually learning

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,280
that 20,000 years ago a quarter of the

73
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,599
earth's land surface was covered in ice

74
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,080
year round and that raised a new

75
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,920
question just how cold was the earth

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,000
during this ice age to answer that

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,200
scientists needed some extraordinary new

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,920
tools paleo climate is the art of the

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,840
possible you know there's only so many

80
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,080
things that you have that are left over

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,640
from thousands of years ago there's even

82
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,799
fewer that are left over from millions

83
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,720
of years ago and even fewer from

84
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,360
hundreds of millions of years ago so we

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,640
have to rely upon natural archives

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,120
things that grow or are deposited and

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,680
somehow record information about the

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,799
climate around them as they form and

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
these archives need to be preserved for

90
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,799
a very long time scientists have only

91
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,120
found a few of these relics of the deep

92
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,280
past often buried in unchanging

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,320
environments like Antarctic ice or

94
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
sediments in the deep sea and at both of

95
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,759
these

96
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,759
archives you have deposits building up

97
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,800
year after year after year and if you're

98
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,960
able to drill or core down into them you

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,120
essentially have a time machine I'll

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,880
just give you an example there is a

101
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,440
certain type of Plankton that lives in

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,600
the surface ocean these are called forif

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,400
and they're about the size of a grain of

104
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,759
sand really small they happen to form

105
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,680
small calcium carbonate shells so just

106
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,039
like a clam might but they're so small

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,960
that they're able to float around in the

108
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,960
surface ocean and when the for manifer

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,000
die their shells fall to the ocean floor

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,840
and are preserved in layers of sediment

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,360
so what does that have to do with the

112
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,120
temperature well it turns out that for

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,440
manifer that grow in warmer Waters build

114
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,919
their shells a little differently as the

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,120
temperature gets hotter the forams

116
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,960
become more sloppy chemists and they

117
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,720
allow more magnesium into their calcium

118
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,240
carbonate shell and so you can measure

119
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,120
the Magnesium to calcium ratio

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
and that's a very strong function of

121
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,360
temperature and there are other time

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,160
traveling thermometers found in tree

123
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,680
rings ice cores and stalagmites deep in

124
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,440
caves when you combine these separate

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,360
lines of evidence we can build a window

126
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,319
into climates from long ago what's more

127
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,720
when scientists tracked these

128
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,960
temperature records further and further

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,360
back in time a surprising new picture

130
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,759
appeared they were able to see see oh

131
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,960
wow it hasn't just been one Ice Age

132
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,240
there's been this cycle going back and

133
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,039
forth between ice ages and warmer

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,960
periods so the Earth has been going in

135
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,520
and out of ice ages over the last

136
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:21,639
million years at a rate of roughly one

137
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,440
cycle per 100,000 years so you'll have a

138
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,240
period like the peak of the last ice age

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,960
about 20,000 years ago and then

140
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,759
temperatures will rise into warm

141
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
climates like we've enjoyed for the last

142
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,120
10,000

143
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:40,720
years how and why well the answer

144
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,440
amazingly lies not here on Earth but out

145
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
in the solar

146
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,160
system so you might know that the Earth

147
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,280
orbits the Sun in an ellipsis not a

148
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:56,400
perfect circle and the Earth is also

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,680
tilted at anytime one pole faces the sun

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
that's the half of the earth that

151
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,199
experiences Summer and the other half

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,240
faces away that's the Earth that

153
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:10,680
experiences winter but over thousands of

154
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:13,560
years that orbit and that tilt well it

155
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,840
shifts the Earth's orbit gradually

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,840
changes as we get pulled by the other

157
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,319
planets and the solar system and so the

158
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,560
Earth's orbit becomes more elliptical or

159
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,520
more circular through time the Earth

160
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,160
tilt changes a little bit through time

161
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,599
in a cyclical Manner and Gra gradually

162
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,919
our North and South Poles might find

163
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,440
that during the summer they're no longer

164
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:41,080
tilted so strongly toward the Sun that

165
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,039
decreases how much sunlight comes into

166
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,639
the Arctic during local summer and makes

167
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,240
it harder to melt away the previous

168
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,680
Winter's snow and ice and it builds up

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,639
and builds up and builds up and

170
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,840
eventually forms an ice

171
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,639
sheet so then the question is okay

172
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,960
you're building some ice sheets in

173
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,840
Northern Canada and Scandinavia why does

174
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,280
that make the whole world cold the real

175
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,599
reason that ice ages are a global

176
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,599
phenomenon is because as you grow an ice

177
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,560
sheet the ice sheet changes ocean

178
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:20,319
circulation and such a way that more

179
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,159
carbon dioxide gets stored in the deep

180
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,400
ocean rather than sticking around in the

181
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:29,039
atmosphere you probably remember that

182
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,280
CO2 is the most important of the heat

183
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,959
trapping gases in our atmosphere that

184
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,039
are causing today's climate change and

185
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:38,599
throughout Earth's history there's been

186
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,959
a close relationship between the average

187
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,919
temperature of our planet and the amount

188
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,000
of CO2 in our atmosphere the scientists

189
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,040
use the tools of paleo climate to look

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,640
at how much CO2 was in the air during

191
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,800
the ice ages in fact we can actually

192
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,959
measure directly the air of the ancient

193
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,760
past because some of it is still

194
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:06,519
around in Antarctica in particular as

195
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,079
the snow builds up and then gets

196
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:13,279
compressed beneath other layers of snow

197
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:17,640
above it and gradually turns into ice it

198
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:21,160
traps little bubbles of air and that air

199
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,600
is pristine samples of the ancient

200
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,000
atmosphere and so scientists will

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,880
collect these ice cores bring them back

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,120
to the lab and then measure directly how

203
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,399
much carb dioxide is in the air from

204
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,200
times in the

205
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,959
past that's really cool all right so

206
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,839
let's recap so the Earth shifts slightly

207
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,760
in Space over thousands of years making

208
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,000
the Arctic summer darker and colder and

209
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,320
ice sheets form and spread and the

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,800
ocean's circulation changes this traps

211
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,120
CO2 deep in the ocean and because there

212
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,240
is less heat trapping CO2 in the

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,440
atmosphere the entire planet begins to

214
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,079
cool and so it's quite a chain of events

215
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,720
that leads from the changes in Earth's

216
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:11,640
orbit to the ice ages themselves so how

217
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,720
much do these changes add up well in the

218
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,600
last ice age which was 20,000 years ago

219
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,600
CO2 in the atmosphere fell by about a

220
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,120
third so do you want to guess how much

221
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,880
the Earth cooled as a

222
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,760
result we now know that in the peak of

223
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:33,480
the last a age it was about 10° f colder

224
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,480
than it was during pre-industrial

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,399
times did you guess correctly or were

226
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,079
you way off maybe you're asking yourself

227
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,519
now wait what just

228
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,000
10° isn't that the difference between a

229
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,320
chilly fall day in a crisp spring

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,920
afternoon yeah it's really striking to

231
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,079
me how different the world was given

232
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,000
only 10° Fahrenheit difference in mean

233
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,600
temperatures so where I'm sitting around

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Boston Massachusetts would have had

235
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,959
about a mile of ice on top of me right

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,680
now from just 10° of cooling which is

237
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,000
about 5 1/ 12° of Celsius by the way but

238
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,839
this is the crucial difference between

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,720
weather and climate if the weather

240
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,160
changes by 10° well you put on a jacket

241
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,639
but if the average climate changes by

242
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,120
10° well you've got the planet where

243
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,680
woolly mammoths roamed as far south as

244
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,839
Illinois and Spain

245
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,600
and then slow changes in Earth's orbit

246
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,200
gradually increase how much summer

247
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,480
sunlight there is in the Arctic and

248
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,920
start to melt back those ice sheets and

249
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,320
the changes go in reverse so the ocean

250
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,040
circulation responds and allows carbon

251
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,120
dioxide that has been stored in the deep

252
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,920
ocean to come back into the atmosphere

253
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,639
and those Rising CO2 levels warm the

254
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,000
entire world like they are

255
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,800
today except not quite like today we

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,920
really really are living through

257
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,360
something that's different now so for

258
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,440
one thing today's climate change is

259
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,079
timed all wrong the Earth's position in

260
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,920
space is not setting us up for more

261
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,079
warming the variations in Earth's orbit

262
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,199
are fairly subtle right now and then

263
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,160
they'll get larger over the next few

264
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:25,360
tens of thousands of years so if there

265
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,240
weren't human caused climate change we

266
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,000
would eventually go back into another

267
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,560
Ice

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,760
Age and a huge difference between the

269
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,040
end of the last ice age and today's

270
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,760
warming is how fast it's happening

271
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,519
now so if you look at the warming coming

272
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,040
out of the last ice age temperatures

273
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,720
were low until about 177,000 years ago

274
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:52,959
and then CO2 started to rise and Global

275
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:57,560
temperatur started to rise and they rose

276
00:12:52,959 --> 00:13:00,760
that 10° fahr in about 7,000

277
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,000
years modern temperature change is about

278
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,199
10 times

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,120
faster which means that today we're

280
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:11,120
facing climate change at a speed that

281
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,399
even our distant nomadic ancestors in

282
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,480
the Ice Age never confronted let alone

283
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,920
the more recent humans who laid the

284
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,279
foundations of civilization as we know

285
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:26,320
it the last 10,000 years have been a

286
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:30,079
period of stability in global

287
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:34,399
temperatures and that period of of

288
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:38,120
stability has coincided with the growth

289
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,279
of complex human societies and dramatic

290
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,680
expansions in human population and I

291
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,920
think it's more than a

292
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,920
coincidence it is true that the Earth

293
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,920
has gone through immense climate change

294
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,120
before many times over in fact but human

295
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,279
civilization has not and especially not

296
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,519
this fast today we are the ones changing

297
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,360
the balance of our atmosphere and we're

298
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,600
the ones who get to decide do we want to

299
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,000
rapidly Shake our planet loose from the

300
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,079
stability that we've always known or

301
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,800
will we be happier and safer if we act

302
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,600
to preserve the climate in which

303
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,030
