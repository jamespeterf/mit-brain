website ip. mit.edu today's topic

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,520
Advanced manufacturing and design is a

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,280
timely one around the world

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,000
manufacturing designer want some more

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,840
growing economic social competitive

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,840
Innovation and National Security

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,200
priorities well at the same time new

42
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,360
technologies such as additive

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,200
manufacturing generative Ai and

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,119
biofabrication are transforming the

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,000
competitive landscape and pushing the

46
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,200
boundaries of what can be made and how

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,239
it's made so today we have five

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,879
fantastic speakers who will each examine

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,800
some of the key moving pieces in this

50
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,000
puzzle and then we reconvene for panel

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
conversation before we start just a few

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,239
quick housekeeping items you can submit

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,959
questions during the presentations

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,319
please use the Q&A button use a chat tab

55
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,720
for technical questions we'll be saving

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,080
most of the questions for the panel but

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,280
depending on how things go we may also

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,840
answer some of them along the way the

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,519
webinar is being recorded and we made

60
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,000

Armstrong is the executive director and

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,720
a research scientist in mit's industrial

00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,840
Performance Center Center where he

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,120
colees the work of the future initiative

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,920
has research and teaching examines how

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
workers firms and regions adapt to

75
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,040
technological change and his current

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,519
projects include the working group on

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,200
gender Ai and its impact on jobs as well

78
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,040
as a book on American manufacturing

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,360
competitiveness his research has been

80
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,560
published and featured in academic and

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
popular Outlets from The New York Times

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,680
uh to the har Business Review so Ben

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,680
over to you thanks so much Steve you

84
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,080
know uh welcome everyone I'm really

85
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,159
excited about this morning's program um

86
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,040
Steve mentioned we had five speakers

87
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,000
including myself and uh what's nice

88
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,519
about today's program is that all the

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,959
speakers really fit together with one

90
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,680
another we have a a growing community of

91
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,200
uh faculty and researchers and students

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,439
at MIT interested in um the issues of

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
the moment in in manufacturing in the

94
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,920
United States and around the world and

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
today I think we're going to be able to

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,319
dig into some of that research and

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,400
understand how not only does it uh

98
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,000
thrive in the lab but also it has real

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,879
impli ations in the real world so we'll

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,959
start in a few moments with John Lou uh

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,480
my my terrific colleague who is working

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,439
on a very exciting program to support

103
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,079
the training of a new type of

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
manufacturing technician and he's going

105
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,280
to go over some of the workforce

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,359
challenges in the current manufacturing

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,400
ecosystem and how his research and and

108
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,440
work as an educator responds to those

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
challenges and then I'll speak a little

110
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,000
bit um about the connection between

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,440
John's work um focused on uh Talent in

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,919
the workforce and then the the later uh

113
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,600
speaker so I'll try to act as a bridge

114
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,639
um in in talking about the state of

115
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,840
manufacturing globally issues of

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
competitiveness and and what really the

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,360
the competitive game of manufacturing

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,880
looks like today then we'll transition

119
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,479
to three presentations about Advanced

120
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,280
Technologies in manufacturing and how

121
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,800
they're being used we'll start with

122
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,039
Bruce Lawler who is not only an MIT

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,320
colleague working on uh machine

124
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,960
intelligence and Manufacturing

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,240
operations the application practical

126
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,759
applications of AI in Manu manfacturing

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,120
but he's also a practitioner he's the

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,039
president of digital for rebuild

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,320
manufacturing which is a very exciting

130
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,400
uh new type of manufacturing company in

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,039
the United States and then we'll hear

132
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,160
from from Chris Love who's um an active

133
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,919
researcher in biotechnology and

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,880
biomanufacturing and he'll talk about

135
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,639
how Innovations in the biow world um

136
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,360
highlight some of the manufactur the

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,840
importance of manufacturing new types of

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,120
products and how manufacturers can stay

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,280
on the Leading Edge in terms of uh uh

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,600
being flexible enough to produce new new

141
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,199
types of things and then finally um

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,800
we'll turn to FZ Ahmed who um is really

143
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,160
a Pioneer in the study of generative AI

144
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,960
applications for manufacturing

145
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,240
particularly in design and then we'll

146
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,319
we'll convene and we'll try to answer

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,479
some of your questions that have come

148
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,240
through the chat um in a final panel

149
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,840
discussion so with that overview of the

150
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
day um we're going to start with

151
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,560
Workforce we'll then Bridge into more

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,039
advanced applications of technology and

153
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,400
we'll try to have a framework to see how

154
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,960
these pieces fit together but without

155
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,720
further Ado I'd love to introduce um

156
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,280
John Lou from mit's leap group who today

157
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,319
is out in the field uh working with some

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,680
um educational institutions and and has

159
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,800
been very gracious to make time um to be

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,120
with all of us so John thank you so much
