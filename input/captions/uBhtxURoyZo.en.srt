1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,840
Okay. Hi everyone. I'm super excited

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,519
actually to be back at MIT. I left as a

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,720
PhD coming back as a

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,400
founder founder of displayed and

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,960
displayed enhances um transportation

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,119
safety thanks to a solution that

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,080
leverages data to perform bridge health

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,199
monitoring in a way that is scalable and

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,680
standardized. But let let's go a bit

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,040
back to the origin. In 2018, we had a

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,760
huge accident in in Italy. Um so I

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
started a PhD during on structural

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,000
health monitoring of bridges during

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,200
which I met my phenomenal co-founders

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,440
and um it brought me to MIT where I also

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,039
met professor Carloati of director of

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,719
sensible city lab as one of our founding

18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,079
shareholders and altogether we decided

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,079
to bring in the market um an academic

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,159
experience uh extremely deep in the

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,760
sector to solve a pressing global

22
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,200
problems. Poor maintenance is the root

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,920
cause of collapses worldwide and this is

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
honestly

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,439
unacceptable. Notwithstanding the

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,479
technology we have, we are still relying

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,479
on this. This is the main tool to assess

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,560
maintenance which is visual inspections.

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,159
They are subjective, inherently

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,080
qualitative, expensive,

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,200
infrequent and we should use data. data

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,680
are there but basically monitoring

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,479
solutions based on data are today a

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,320
niche in the market and why is that

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,159
because there is fairly no

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
interpretation of this data and

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
management companies don't need data

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
they need actionable insights they

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,240
require huge initial investment that's

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,840
it's okay on the golden gate what about

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,240
all the other 99.9% of bridges and they

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,759
are not integrated um we are trying to

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,920
redefine the rules of the game We

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
conceived and realized a monitoring

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
solution suitable for widespread

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
adoption across the whole network. What

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
we offer is a monitoring as a service

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,720
which means we we start with a provision

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,040
of proprietary sensors, data collection,

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,120
data analysis that the street results of

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,160
our PhDs and then of course information

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,360
delivery thanks to a very

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,599
simple basically asset management

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
platform. By doing this, our solution is

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,879
able to cut 70% of deployment cost and

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,040
time, enhancing scalability and we are

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,920
three times more efficient in

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
identifying early on structural

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,840
anomalies. But we are at MIT. So let's

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,400
go a bit deeper into the technology. Um

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,040
we are first presenting our smart

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,360
sensor. So basically what we built is a

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
family of sensors with the same data

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
quality of traditional wire solutions

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,319
but without wires. So extremely handy,

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
easy to deploy, quick and that's again I

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,480
like to call them the wearables of the

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,120
bridges and they collect data that we

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,599
analyze with our algorithms. They were

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,239
tested on years of data coming for on

71
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,080
from more than 25 bridges. This was I

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,800
would say what we mainly developed

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,080
during our PhDs. They are they are

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,319
proven effectively uh to be able to

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,319
tackle damage scenarios potentially

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,920
critical and currently totally

77
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,000
unnoticeable with traditional

78
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,080
techniques. So all these things have to

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,480
be combined in something easy. So a

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,239
platform that's basically based on

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,080
thresholds. It has to be a traffic light

82
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,480
that also my mother should be able to

83
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,560
understand is like what you should do

84
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,280
where you should act and how can you

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,159
enhance the safety and efficiency of the

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,799
network through your bridges. Um a bit

87
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,360
back into the topic of the conference

88
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,519
why AI on bridges transportation

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
networks features a high structural

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,120
complexity large number of

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,799
infrastructures which means huge amount

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,680
of data and thus need for

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,280
standardization. This is the sweet spot

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,760
for AI technology. More than that, some

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
problems can be extremely challenging to

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,720
model. So through AI, we can shift from

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,040
a modelbased approach to a datadriven

98
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,360
one where we can inference complex

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,239
mathematical model from data. And I want

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,280
to talk you about a real case study was

101
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,000
2020. We were monitoring a bridge during

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,759
our PhD. We were there for a year and

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
then a severe flood in the bridge. Now,

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,360
can you imagine how can I model the

105
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,000
effect of a flood on a 100 uh year old

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,639
bridge in Italy? Impossible. But thanks

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to data, we could basically learn from

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,600
what we had before and follow the bridge

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,960
day after day, saving

110
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,840
€300,000 to the Italian for the Italian

111
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,400
government and keeping the bridge open

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,400
without any traffic disruption until it

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,520
settle back to its original prefall

114
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,800
status. I'm not talking about the market

115
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,040
uh because you know uh what I want to do

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,880
is we are now operating in Italy but we

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
are trying to see to feel the

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,800
temperature here in the US to see if the

119
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,040
market is ready. We would like to talk

120
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,720
to government agencies, department of

121
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,039
transportation, city of Cambridge, city

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,280
of Boston to know if they feel this

123
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,680
problem as being pressing. Of course, we

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,639
refer to these as people who benefit

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,960
from our solution, but we also see this

126
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
technology to become a play in the asset

127
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,000
management on all large infrastructure

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,639
that are basically at at the the root

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,800
foundation of the so the soio economic

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,520
development of countries worldwide.

131
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,919
Thank you very much.

132
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,919
Thank you, Lorenzo.
