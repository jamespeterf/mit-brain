1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,459
If a child is lucky and

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,794
is allowed to be curious

3
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,504
and to imagine, that's a

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,548
nice way to let the child grow.

5
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,508
I am the fourth of four,

6
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,510
There is a big gap between them and me.

7
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,053
So I spent a lot of time

8
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,722
by myself in the backyard,

9
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,223
which is a piece of dirt and

10
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,267
just plain imaginary things.

11
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,436
I had that very vivid imagination.

12
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,187
It was wonderful.

13
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,564
I mean, I grew up in a

14
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,898
city called Maracaibo.

15
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,483
And when I was nine, my

16
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,818
family moved to Caracas.

17
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,528
I loved being with my

18
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,779
peers, my classmates,

19
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,239
and my friends from the neighborhood.

20
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,116
I remember evenings in

21
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,701
which, as a teenager,

22
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,202
I would go Friday

23
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,454
nights to a little place

24
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,913
that sold ice cream, and it

25
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,582
was just sat there and chatted

26
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,250
and drink ice cream, and

27
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,877
then go home close to midnight.

28
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,379
It was just safe and fun.

29
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,175
I was curious

30
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,801
academically about everything,

31
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,927
but the only thing

32
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,262
that I did have a sense

33
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,638
of going to high

34
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,348
school was that I eventually

35
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,393
have to have a job.

36
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,895
You know, when you're growing up,

37
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,397
all you know is what you see around you.

38
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,899
You don't come up with

39
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,400
ideas of how the world is.

40
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,944
You just learn the world that you see.

41
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,697
And the world that I saw,

42
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,239
there's not too many

43
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,365
people going to high school,

44
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,242
not too many career-oriented people.

45
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,495
I thank my brother for that,

46
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,455
because he opened that window to me,

47
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,832
and I saw that as an opportunity.

48
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,250
What I did is I looked

49
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,877
to what does the country,

50
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,961
what does Venezuela need?

51
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,838
And at the time, Venezuela needed a lot

52
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,839
of electrical engineers.

53
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,801
So bingo, I'll be an electrical engineer.

54
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,723
I remember my days as a college student,

55
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,267
borrowing books from the library and

56
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,477
borrowing the MIT books.

57
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,270
I thought MIT was a person.

58
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,981
I had no clue that that was a university.

59
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,359
For me, that was M-I-T.

60
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,652
I thought this is an

61
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,861
author that wrote those books.

62
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,238
I mean, I had no clue.

63
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,033
And I realized how special it was for me

64
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,829
to be studying from the books written

65
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,664
by those who created that knowledge.

66
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624
And now I'm in this

67
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,876
place that creates knowledge.

68
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,712
And once I came here, I never went back.

69
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,589
I mean, I was just so happy.

70
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,966
I just didn't leave.

71
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,804
I didn't know a place like this existed.

72
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,180
I mean, it was just such a

73
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,684
wonderful experience for me,

74
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,769
even right now, saying, give me chills.

75
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,437
I mean, at this place, I was impressed

76
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,022
by the richness of the

77
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,899
variety of groups of people

78
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,984
and cultures here.

79
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,027
Nobody here speaks English properly.

80
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,320
They all speak with a funny accent.

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,073
And they are interviewing another one

82
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:37,782
with a funny accent.

83
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,491
So there is something

84
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,410
very interesting about this.

85
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,706
I've had so many conversations with people

86
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,082
from different cultures

87
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,834
that have been brought up

88
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,918
with different narratives.

89
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,628
And they can see a fact.

90
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,671
And they can interpret

91
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,755
it in different ways.

92
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,465
I cannot think of everything

93
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,633
because I have blind spots.

94
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,051
But if I have enough

95
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,845
people around me collectively,

96
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,222
collectively, we don't have a blind spot.

97
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,683
There is no richer place because every

98
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
point of view is here.

99
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,229
That is what makes this place so special.
