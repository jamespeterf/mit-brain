1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,920
Yeah. So, we're sort of in the last part

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,039
of the class now and I've been

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,039
reflecting on what what to do together.

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,119
Um and uh I asked everybody for for some

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,080
input, a little survey about what topics

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,359
to do and how much detail to do.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,040
Um there was no consensus in the survey

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,440
of of what people wanted to do. Um

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,520
but I've decided I would like to do for

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
a couple of weeks uh talk about some

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,800
applications of projection theory in

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,680
other areas. Um and then in the last

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,680
couple weeks try to talk about at least

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,399
the some of the main ideas in the proof

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,920
of the sharp projection theorem.

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,079
Um

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
yeah so we recently had been doing uh

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
Burgans's projection theorem and the

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,640
burganc cat's projection theorem in

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,320
finite fields and um we so

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
feeling that that we really had to work

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,320
pretty hard for those things and it was

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,720
striking that we had to work pretty hard

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,560
just to get this like very small uh

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,479
improvement um and um so in some of what

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
we'll do in the rest of the class I I

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,560
will try to show that that that small

28
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
improvement is really valuable

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,759
Um

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,280
okay. Um so the yeah so the so so the

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
the plan for the rest of the class is

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,520
for for about one week we'll talk about

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
random walks on groups and then for

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,079
about one week we'll talk about

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
homogeneous dynamics. Um and then at the

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,360
end we'll talk about the sharp

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,720
projection theorem.

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,159
Okay. Um

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,560
um cool. And also in the last few

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,880
classes I felt that we were um doing

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,520
some very technical things and and and

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,159
uh um sometimes a little bit of a

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,840
struggle. Um so for for today what I

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
want to do is to give I hope a very

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,399
friendly induct in introduction to

46
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,399
random walks on groups and then um next

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
week on Tuesday to explain how

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
projection theory helps to figure out

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,560
some interesting things.

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Okay.

51
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,200
[Applause]

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,200
So talk about

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,800
random walks

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,800
of groups.

55
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,239
All right. So suppose that G is a finite

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,280
group

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,720
and then mu is a probability measure on

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,760
G. So I'll think of it

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:51,720
as a function on G

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,720
which is non- negative and sums to one.

61
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,360
Okay. So if you have a probability

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,200
measure like this, you can do a random

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,599
walk where at each step of the random

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,640
walk, you pick an element of G by this

65
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,879
probability and then you move by that

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,879
element. So here's how the random walk

67
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,879
works.

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:21,840
So you start somewhere

69
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:26,800
say at G0 then you sample

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:32,480
a step h from mu

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,000
and the next guy g1 is g 0 * h.

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,879
So that's one step of the random walk

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,879
and then you can keep doing this.

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,040
Okay. And um so if you do take K steps

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
of the random walk then that will be

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,159
there will be some probability

77
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,519
distribution of where you end up after k

78
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,200
steps and the main question about one

79
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
main question about random walks is how

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
evenly distributed is that probability

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,879
distribution.

82
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,280
Um so

83
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,599
question

84
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,599
how evenly

85
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,599
distributed

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,200
is uh the random walk after k steps.

87
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,919
Okay. And we'll make we'll make this

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,919
more precise in a moment.

89
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,320
All right. So,

90
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:37,240
so we um it is helpful to describe this

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,240
random walk using uh convolution.

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
Okay, so convolution on a group looks

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,160
like this. We have two functions f_sub_1

94
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,360
and f_sub_2 on this group. And then if I

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,520
convolve them with each other

96
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:05,919
and I evaluate that at g, that's the sum

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:08,400
g1 * g2 = g. f of g1 f_sub_1 of g1

98
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,560
f_sub_2 of g2.

99
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,240
That's the sum over all the g1 and g2

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,240
that multiply to g of of this.

101
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:24,639
Okay. Um and then for mu we can make an

102
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,440
operator and t mu of f is just f

103
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,960
convolved with mu. And this operator

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,520
basically describes this random walk.

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,639
So let's say how they're related. So

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,520
suppose I were to take t mu and apply it

107
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,960
to the delta function at g knot and

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,039
evaluate that at some g.

109
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,520
Um

110
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,759
okay. So let's let's see what's a good

111
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,479
way to write this.

112
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,000
Um so that's the sum. Um actually let me

113
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,759
look at how I wrote it in my notes. I

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,039
tried writing this a few ways and then I

115
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,000
decided there was a good way to write

116
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,800
it.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,680
Right? Yeah. Let's write it this way.

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:16,319
So suppose I want to evaluate this at g*

119
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:22,560
h. So that's the sum over g1 * g2 = g *

120
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:25,600
h of delta function at g of g1 time mu

121
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,600
of g2.

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,600
All right. So the only way that this sum

123
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,600
can be not zero is if g1 is g0.

124
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:42,479
So there's only one term in this sum.

125
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,160
So this um g 0 * g2 is g 0 * h of mu of

126
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,520
g2.

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,319
There's only one term and it's the term

128
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,319
where g2 is h.

129
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,880
Okay. So this thing is the probability

130
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,360
distribution of one step of the random

131
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,639
walk. The probability if I started at g

132
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,720
that I end up at g* h is mu of h. That's

133
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,720
the definition of my random walk. So

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,440
this operator is performing one step of

135
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,560
the random walker. And therefore if I

136
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:19,120
take t mu to the k of delta g0 that's uh

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,680
like k steps of the random walk

138
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,680
starting at g.

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Okay.

140
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,160
Um actually let me say this I could say

141
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,160
this better.

142
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:48,720
So this is the probability

143
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:52,360
that a random walk is at g

144
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,360
after k steps.

145
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,080
Okay. So now we can take this question

146
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
how evenly distributed is the random

147
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,599
walk. We can write that as a precise

148
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,800
question about this. I'll call it

149
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,800
question one.

150
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,840
So I'd like to estimate

151
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,560
okay t mu to the k of delta g0. So this

152
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,639
is the actual probability distribution.

153
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,960
And if the probability was completely

154
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,319
even over the whole group, it would be

155
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
one over the size of the group

156
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,120
everywhere. So I'm going to see how

157
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,680
close it is to that by measuring the

158
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,279
norm of this difference. So I like to

159
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,360
estimate that. Okay. And L2 is helpful

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,080
but also perhaps a little arbitrary. You

161
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,959
could also put other norms. So could put

162
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,959
or L infinity or maybe some other norm.

163
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,320
Okay. So this is the kind of question

164
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,680
about random walks on groups that we are

165
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,440
going to try to understand.

166
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,279
All right. So um to understand this it

167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,839
is helpful to notice that this is a

168
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,080
linear operator. This t- mu is a linear

169
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,560
operator. It's basically a matrix. And

170
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
it's helpful to think about that um in

171
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,320
terms of matrix ideas like the singular

172
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,320
values and singular vectors of this

173
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
matrix.

174
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,279
So t mu plus a linear operator

175
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:29,000
and we're going to study

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,000
singular values and singular vectors

177
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,480
of t.

178
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,800
Okay. So there is um

179
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:43,120
one um simple singular value which is or

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,680
value I guess that t mu of one is one.

181
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
>> Yeah.

182
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,959
>> Are singular values and singular vectors

183
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,680
just the same as values and values.

184
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,240
>> Um they are closely related. Um

185
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,640
so let me do a quick review of singular

186
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,640
values and values. Right.

187
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,200
Um,

188
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,560
so if you have a a matrix and you think

189
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,800
about what it does to the unit ball, it

190
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
will turn the unit ball into an

191
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,480
ellipsoid.

192
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,480
Um and the principal axes of this

193
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,079
ellipsoid are the singular values sigma

194
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,560
1

195
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,560
sigma 2.

196
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,680
Okay. And then um

197
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,680
uh so if we look at the pre-im images of

198
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
these things those will be the singular

199
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,880
vectors.

200
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,200
So well depending on the matrix they

201
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,200
could be pointing any which way but

202
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:05,360
maybe that's um v2

203
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,720
and that is v1.

204
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,200
Okay. And they will always be so we'll

205
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,200
have um

206
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,560
uh

207
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,959
so the the vi or orthonormal

208
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,079
and the size of mvi

209
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,760
is sigma.

210
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,640
Um

211
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,519
and the mvi are also worth are also

212
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,519
orthogonal. Those

213
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,440
are the singular vectors.

214
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,200
Okay. Now they are not generally igen

215
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:53,120
vectors in the sense that mvi will not

216
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,600
usually be a multiple of vi. Uh but they

217
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:01,720
are closely related to them. Um the vi

218
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,720
are the igen vectors

219
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:14,079
of m star or m m star I guess. Um

220
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:18,240
and the uh sigma i squared are the igen

221
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:21,720
values of m star mic

222
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,720
mm star.

223
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,959
Um

224
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,519
so in particular this biggest uh this

225
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,839
biggest singular vector measures the

226
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,720
operator norm of the matrix which is

227
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,399
that the the um so these are these are

228
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,399
ordered like this and um

229
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,399
MV

230
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,839
is at most sigma 1

231
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,320
Okay, so the reason we're talking about

232
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,079
singular values is we're going to care

233
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,519
about stuff like this. And

234
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,760
this is naturally associated with

235
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,279
singular values. If m is not symmetric,

236
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,839
it's not necessarily the same as talking

237
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,839
about values.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,720
Okay.

239
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Um,

240
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,160
okay. So, if we take this tu of the

241
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
function one, the constant function,

242
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,320
we'll just get one because this t- mu is

243
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,920
is like an averaging operator.

244
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,600
We're averaging t. So, t mu of f at g is

245
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,720
the average value at of g at some other

246
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,519
places around g that are dictated by mu.

247
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:50,240
So t mu of one is one.

248
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:53,839
Okay. And um now it's uh okay. So so

249
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,800
that implies that the that the the Okay.

250
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:01,880
So I'll do a little lema.

251
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,880
The the the largest singular value.

252
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:11,600
Yeah. Okay. So little lema is that t mu

253
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:15,760
of f and l2 is at most f and l2 and this

254
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,560
is sharp because of this example.

255
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,560
They could be they could be equal.

256
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Okay.

257
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,399
Okay. So proving this will help us think

258
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:32,560
a little bit about what convolution

259
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:34,959
means. Um so t mu of f is f convolved

260
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,120
with mu

261
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:43,680
g here.

262
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:46,000
So that's the sum g1 g2 = g f of g1 mu

263
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,680
of g2.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,760
And I'd like to think of this as a sum

265
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,199
over g2. So it's the sum over g2 because

266
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,199
I'm thinking of it that way. I can bring

267
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:02,320
the mu of g2 out front and then what I

268
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:05,320
have left is f of g1 which is g * g2

269
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,320
inverse

270
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,240
and I want to think of this as a linear

271
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,519
combination of a bunch of different

272
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,920
functions of g.

273
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,360
Okay, let's give them a name. So this

274
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,959
function of g is sort of f but but we

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
first did this thing and I want I want

276
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,320
you to think of it as taking f and then

277
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,240
shifting it using the group. So it's the

278
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:34,160
right translation by g2 of f of g is

279
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:38,560
defined to be this thing here.

280
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,639
So we could plug that in. Um and this

281
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,839
shifting operation doesn't change the

282
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:49,639
norm of g. So, RG2 of F in L2 is the

283
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,639
same as F in R2.

284
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,480
Ah, I've been mentioning L2. What? Yeah,

285
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,079
I should say.

286
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,690
Okay, let me pause for a second. I

287
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:02,579
should have said something before.

288
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,579
[Applause]

289
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,279
Okay, so when we have these functions on

290
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,560
G, we're going to measure their norm.

291
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:16,639
Um, and if I have f L2 of G, this is

292
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,839
going to be some G and G, f of gum

293
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,240
squared to the 12. Or I could take an

294
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,040
inner product, the inner product of

295
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,800
f_sub_1 and f_sub_2 is the sum g and g,

296
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,480
f_sub_1 of g, f_sub_2 of g to that. So

297
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,839
the functions on g are I hope we're

298
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,120
spaced with this with this natural

299
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,279
measure. Okay. Um so then if I take a

300
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,199
function and I

301
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,600
translate it or do this right

302
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
translation um it just sort of permutes

303
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,959
the value so it doesn't change this

304
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,000
thing.

305
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:54,560
Okay. So now if we look at our t mu of f

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,680
um

307
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,680
um I have this

308
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,759
yeah

309
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:18,319
I'm interested in the norm of t mu of f.

310
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,839
This is the norm of the sum on G2 mu of

311
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,039
G2

312
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,360
R subg2 of F.

313
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,480
It's a linear combination of these

314
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,720
functions which are all translates of F.

315
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,120
And L2 is a norm. It obeys the triangle

316
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,039
inequality. So this is less than the sum

317
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,559
on G2 mu of G2

318
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,720
RG2 of F and L2. All of these have the

319
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,720
same norm.

320
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,919
which is the L2 norm of F and the L2

321
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,280
norm and then this adds up to one. So

322
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,280
this is just the L2 norm of F.

323
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,919
Okay,

324
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,160
so this is a basic fact about averaging

325
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:06,160
operators. Um and

326
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,720
to understand whether the random walk is

327
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,520
mixing things up, we have to care about

328
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,840
how it behaves on the space orthogonal

329
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,760
to one. And the first observation is

330
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,480
that it preserves the space orthogonal

331
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,480
to one. So let's give that space a name.

332
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
Say L2 of G KN is the set of F and L2 of

333
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,000
G.

334
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,320
So that

335
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,840
sum G and G of F of G is zero. This is

336
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
saying that f is orthogonal to the

337
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,320
constant function.

338
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:42,400
Okay. So another simple lema is that our

339
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,039
operator t mu actually takes this space

340
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,799
to itself. So it takes the constant

341
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,120
function to itself and it takes the

342
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,960
perpendicular space to itself which will

343
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,200
imply that the constant function is one

344
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
of the singular vectors of the of of

345
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,240
this operator.

346
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,760
Okay. So proof

347
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,840
um uh

348
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,720
so I want to understand the sum g and g

349
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,480
of t team muf of g. Going to imagine

350
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
that the sum of f of g is zero. And I

351
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,280
want to see if that's still true. All

352
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:23,440
right. So that's the sum g and g sum g1

353
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,559
* g2 equals g. f of g1 mu of g2.

354
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,360
And if you think about what we're

355
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,520
summing over, we're just summing over G1

356
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,160
and G2.

357
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:40,440
So this is the sum over G1 and G2 of F

358
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,440
of G1, mu of G2. And now that factors.

359
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,400
So this is one. And if F was in L2 of

360
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,400
GN, this would be zero.

361
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,039
This is

362
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,760
so f if f is an l2 of g not then so t mu

363
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,240
of f will be

364
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,240
okay Oh,

365
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,859
[Applause]

366
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:40,400
all right. So, so we've seen that um

367
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,960
t mu of one is one and t mu takes l2 of

368
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,080
g kn to itself.

369
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,799
So this is the largest singular value

370
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,760
we've seen and um and then here there's

371
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,760
something else. So let's say sigma one

372
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,080
of t mu.

373
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,640
So, so this this one could I'll call it

374
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,240
sigma kn of t mu. Somehow in this

375
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,760
setting the one is sort of trivial and

376
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,919
everything else will depend on the trace

377
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:09,480
of mu. So sigma 1 of t mu is the largest

378
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,480
singular value

379
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,280
of of this part.

380
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,640
Okay.

381
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,760
All right. So question two is going to

382
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,360
be to estimate that

383
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,840
estimate sigma one of t and these two

384
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,559
questions are related to each other. Um

385
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,640
this thing helps to understand um how I

386
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,880
mean helps a lot to understand how this

387
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,960
operator behaves and and to and to

388
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,120
answer question one. So let me put up a

389
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
simple proposition how question two is

390
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,679
related to question one.

391
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,919
So proposition if you look at that thing

392
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:58,000
t mu to the k delta function g minus 1 /

393
00:21:51,919 --> 00:22:02,440
g in l2 this is bounded by sigma 1 of t

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,440
mu to the k.

395
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,039
Okay so proof.

396
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,400
So we want to see what t mu to the k

397
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,919
does to a delta function at a point.

398
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,720
Let's take this delta function at a

399
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,240
point and t mu splits up the constant

400
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,760
function is an igen function and then

401
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,480
and then then the the the things with

402
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,320
mean zero. So let's split up this delta

403
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,039
function. So the the

404
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,600
constant part of it is like this and

405
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:37,840
then we have this.

406
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,840
So the reason we split it up that way is

407
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,120
that this part which in the beginning of

408
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,280
the class we could have we would have

409
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:50,480
called like the high part of this um so

410
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:53,200
I guess I'll do that that's in L2 of G 0

411
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,280
mean zero part okay now what happens

412
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,039
when we apply this operator well this

413
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,200
operator takes constants to constants

414
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:06,880
uh it's the identity on the constant

415
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:09,120
part um and so I take t mu to the k

416
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,440
delta g kn

417
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,400
this part will say stay stay like one

418
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,240
over one over I'll take the left hand

419
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,720
side and then if I subtract that it will

420
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,760
disappear so what I'll be left with is t

421
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,799
mu to the k on

422
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:29,360
this uh high part of the delta g not

423
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,799
okay how big is that well this part

424
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,360
lives in this space so we can bound the

425
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,799
size of this thing using the uh singular

426
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:43,440
vector. Um and so so

427
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,520
I get t mu

428
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,120
to the k

429
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,640
of delta g high

430
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:57,039
two that's bounded by

431
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:01,559
sigma 1 of t mu to the k

432
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,559
times delta g high2

433
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,679
Okay. And now it's it's also now

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,240
straightforward to check that this is

435
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,240
smaller than one.

436
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:33,840
Okay.

437
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:36,799
So uh it's an application um

438
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:42,000
if we were able to arrange that sigma 1

439
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:44,480
t mu to the k was less than 1 over 100

440
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,840
times the size of g

441
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,480
um then well this l2 norm would be less

442
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,799
than one over 100 times the size of g

443
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,039
and so in particular the l infinity norm

444
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,440
would be less than one over 100 times

445
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,520
the size of g. So then I would say that

446
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:06,640
for every g um

447
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:10,320
t mu k delta g of g minus one over the

448
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,960
size of g would be smaller than 1 over

449
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,320
100 times the size of g. That would tell

450
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,559
us say that this function is pretty

451
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,279
close to this constant function within

452
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:23,559
1%. So that random walk would now have

453
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,559
mixed uh pretty thoroughly.

454
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,559
Okay, great. So if we can get our hands

455
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,360
on sigma 1 of t mu, then we can figure

456
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,919
out how long it takes this random walk

457
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,919
to mix evenly.

458
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,799
Cool.

459
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,080
Okay.

460
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,000
So now let me mention tell you an

461
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,080
interesting example of a particular

462
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,120
group and a particular mu where there's

463
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,120
a cool estimate for this

464
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:32,120
So we are going to mostly focus or maybe

465
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,120
only focus on the group SL2 of FP

466
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,640
and um could pick many different

467
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,480
measures for a random walk but one nice

468
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,200
one which has been studied is to take

469
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:48,159
the set A to be so f so first of all um

470
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,840
if A is a subset of G. There's a natural

471
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,200
measure on A which is the uniform

472
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,760
measure. So measure on A which is one

473
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,200
over the cardality of A times the sum A

474
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:04,080
and A of delta A.

475
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,840
Okay. Um okay. So there's a nice set A

476
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,039
inside of here which was studied by

477
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Selberg. A Selberg.

478
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,440
Uh

479
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,679
well okay which is relevant to a theorem

480
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,679
of Selberg. P set his third differently.

481
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,679
But

482
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,640
so there are four elements in this set.

483
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,799
Um and these are generators of the group

484
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,159
SL2FP. There are many ways you could

485
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,760
choose generators for this group, but

486
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,600
this is probably the simplest way.

487
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,880
Um

488
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,960
and okay and now I can state a theorem.

489
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,360
So theorem one exists a positive c I

490
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,919
think one one over 100 should be fine.

491
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:53,760
Um so that

492
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:58,320
for every p prime if you take a selberg

493
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,799
and sl2 of fp you make a random walk. Um

494
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,399
and so in this setting let me write t a

495
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:07,200
for t sub mu sub a.

496
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:12,320
um then

497
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:16,360
sigma 1 of ta is less than 1 minus c. So

498
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,360
uniformly for all primes.

499
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,799
So if this is say 99 over 100 then you

500
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,320
can just read off uh you know high

501
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,760
powers of this are bounded by something

502
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,240
and you can plug that into the

503
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,279
discussion over here. So it says that

504
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,760
that random walk mixes extremely fast.

505
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,640
Yeah.

506
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,840
>> How does sigma one behave kind of as it

507
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,320
over time? Does it converge to sub or

508
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,360
oscillate a lot?

509
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:54,880
>> Um so the question is how does sigma 1

510
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,720
of ta behave um as as the prime varies?

511
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,720
I do not know the answer to that

512
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
question.

513
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,360
Um so I should say so let me say that

514
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:11,399
this was this is a correlary of a

515
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,399
theorem of Selberg

516
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,320
from the late 50s

517
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,440
um and Selberg act's actual theorem is

518
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,120
about the first igen value of the

519
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,320
lelassian on a hyperbolic surface which

520
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,159
is associated to this group

521
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,679
and you can go back and forth. With

522
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,279
modern technology, it's considered not

523
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
very difficult to go back and forth

524
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,919
between a bound for the igen value of

525
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,279
the surface and a bound here. Uh but

526
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,840
when you do go back and forth, you will

527
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,159
screw up the constants.

528
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,520
Um Selberg's theorem was that the first

529
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,360
igen value of that surface was at least

530
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,880
316s

531
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,399
and that's probably not the right

532
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
answer. And he conjectured that it

533
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,039
should be a quarter.

534
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,640
Um so for his actual problem there was

535
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,559
there is a beautiful conjecture about

536
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,840
what happens as p goes to infinity which

537
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,520
is that the values should converge to a

538
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,720
quarter

539
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,720
um for this I'm not sure

540
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,120
okay cool

541
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:24,559
okay so bounds like this are also

542
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,120
related to uh expand standard graphs,

543
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,399
isoparametric inequalities in graphs and

544
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,679
I thought I would also show that um and

545
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,679
um so it it shows that well okay so so

546
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,159
let me explain that. So we can we can if

547
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,760
you have a set of of generators inside

548
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,190
of a group we can use that to make a

549
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,600
graph called a kaly graph.

550
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,120
[Applause]

551
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,039
And this mixing inequality

552
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,880
can be thought of or implies some

553
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,880
interesting geometric features of the

554
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,880
graph.

555
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,720
So um

556
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,120
expansion

557
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,120
in graphs.

558
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:28,840
Okay. So if G is a finite group

559
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,840
then A is a set of generators

560
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,799
and I guess that to have a graph maybe

561
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,799
we should say that is a symmetric set of

562
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,519
generators. I don't know if that's

563
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,679
important. Yeah, let's leave it.

564
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,559
Um

565
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,919
then we'll have a kaly graph kaly graph

566
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,720
of GA. This is a graph.

567
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:53,760
The vertices

568
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,559
are G and G. And a pair G1, G2

569
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:02,799
um is an edge

570
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:04,640
if and only if um G2 is G1 * A or vice

571
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,399
versa.

572
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,120
Um yeah, so I guess we should have it

573
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:13,600
symmetric. Um G2= G1 * A where A is in

574
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,440
A.

575
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,960
Okay. And the random walk we've been

576
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,120
imagining is basically the random walk

577
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,279
on this graph. You start at a vertex and

578
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,559
you move randomly to a neighboring along

579
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,559
the edges. Yeah.

580
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,519
>> How do you identify SL2 of a finite

581
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:32,399
field with a hyperbolic surface?

582
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,600
>> Um yeah, I I I will Okay, we'll talk

583
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,120
about the connection to hyperbolic

584
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,399
geometry a little later when we talk

585
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,440
about the proof of this theorem, but

586
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,000
let's do it then.

587
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,880
Yeah. Okay.

588
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,600
Um

589
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,399
okay so that's the kaly graph

590
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,039
um

591
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,640
and in this graph if I have subsets s

592
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,440
and t inside of the vertices e of s and

593
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,960
t the edges from s to t that's going to

594
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:10,159
be the set of g1 g2 and s cross t so

595
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:13,279
that g1 g2 is an edge

596
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:18,519
a set of edges from fast.

597
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,519
Okay. So, proposition

598
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:26,240
if we have CGA is above then the number

599
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,960
of edges from S to S complement. So, S

600
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,919
is going to be a subset of the vertices.

601
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,440
number of these edges is at least one

602
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,440
minus sigma 1 of TA

603
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,919
times

604
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,919
a * S * S complement over G.

605
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,039
Okay, so let's digest this a little bit.

606
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,559
Um so what does this expression mean?

607
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,159
Well, there are S.

608
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,240
This is the this is how many points

609
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,320
there are in the set S. From each of

610
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,000
those points, there are a edges coming

611
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,760
out. So, this is how many edges there

612
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,679
are that are leaving points at S.

613
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,520
How many of them do we think end up in S

614
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,000
complement? Well, we don't really know,

615
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,760
but as a reference point,

616
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,520
everything was sort of random. The

617
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,040
fraction of edges that ended up in S

618
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,280
complement might be S complement over G.

619
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,200
So this expression here would be the

620
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,359
typical number of edges from S to S

621
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,520
complement if we had a random graph

622
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,359
where each vertex was in this many

623
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,040
edges.

624
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,720
Okay. And then we're going to say that

625
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
the actual number of edges is at least

626
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,679
some fraction of that.

627
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,679
If sigma 1 of TA were one, this would be

628
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,720
a trivial inequality. It's bigger than

629
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,480
zero. But if sigma 1 is is smaller than

630
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,000
one, then this is a non-trivial

631
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,599
inequality. and it says that the number

632
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,520
of edges is a certain a definite

633
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,639
fraction of what you would see in the

634
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,400
random model.

635
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,920
Okay, so let's prove this or at least

636
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,480
give a proof sketch.

637
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,920
So the key point is that we can describe

638
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,680
this quantity using this operator TA and

639
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,720
then it becomes not so surprising that

640
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,520
the singular value of TA is relevant.

641
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,800
How do you do it? The number of edges

642
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:24,400
from S to S complement is the inner

643
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:26,880
product is inner product of TA of the

644
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,200
characteristic function of S with the

645
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,680
characteristic function of S complement

646
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,560
and there's a factor of a in front. This

647
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,359
is a normalization. If if TA had been

648
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,800
just TA is an averaging operator, but we

649
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,560
didn't really want to average. We wanted

650
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,560
to count edges. So there's an extra

651
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,560
factor.

652
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,640
Okay. Does this look plausible to

653
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,839
people? Should we write this?

654
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,599
Let's write this out a little bit.

655
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,599
So t a1s

656
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,720
of g

657
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:14,359
is 1 / a sum a and a

658
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,359
of uh

659
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,720
um

660
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,839
s of g

661
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,839
a inverse.

662
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,839
So that's the definition of the of the

663
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,839
convolution.

664
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,839
Um

665
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:46,480
so we we so then when we take this inner

666
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:49,720
product we're going to have the um sum g

667
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,720
and g

668
00:36:50,800 --> 00:37:01,599
1 / a sum a

669
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,599
1 s of g a inverse one s complement of

670
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,920
So we will only be counting

671
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,119
uh we'll be counting G's that are in S

672
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,599
complement but GA inverse is an S and

673
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,000
that's an edge that starts in S and goes

674
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,000
to S complnt.

675
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,000
So S S complement

676
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,800
over here we have G. Over here we have

677
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,560
GA inverse and those are connected by an

678
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,560
edge. That's the thing that we're

679
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,560
counting.

680
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,440
Okay, this double sum here means we're

681
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,359
counting all of the going through all

682
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,320
the edges, but we're only counting an

683
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,920
edge if it goes from S to S complement.

684
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,400
And we have this, which we didn't really

685
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,640
want, which is why we multiplied by this

686
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,640
over here.

687
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Okay, good.

688
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,000
Okay, so now remember that this operator

689
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,280
uh sort of splits we it takes the

690
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,280
constant functions to the constant

691
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,280
functions and it takes the mean zero

692
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,280
functions to the mean zero functions. So

693
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,960
we should split everybody in sight into

694
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,960
a constant part and a mean zero part.

695
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:20,079
So we split

696
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:25,680
1 s is s over g that's the constant part

697
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:30,880
plus 1 s minus s over g. So this I'll

698
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,240
call it 1 s high and it lives in l2 g0.

699
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,960
Okay. Do the same thing for s

700
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,680
complement. So now the number of edges

701
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:42,000
from S to S complement

702
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,480
that is A times

703
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,800
um okay we'll have TA of the constant

704
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:54,320
parts so that's SG s complement G

705
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,200
plus A times the high frequency high

706
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:02,720
frequency parts uh the non the mean zero

707
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:06,280
parts um TA of 1s high

708
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,280
one as complement.

709
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,800
Okay. So let's call this zero and this

710
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,000
is the high part or the let's call this

711
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,320
the constant part and this is the high

712
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
part.

713
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,839
Okay. So the rest of it is just a

714
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,760
computation and I won't do the algebra

715
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,079
carefully but if you do the constant

716
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,880
part you get this as SS complement over

717
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,320
G. The constant part exactly tracks what

718
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,320
would happen if all the edges were

719
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,839
random. Okay. And then for the high part

720
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,960
of course we won't compute it exactly

721
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,960
because we have to know what the

722
00:39:50,960 --> 00:40:00,880
operator TA is. But we can bound it by

723
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:05,760
the um by the norm of TA sigma 1 of TA

724
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:11,640
times 1 S high in L2

725
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,640
times 1 S complement high in L2.

726
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,880
Okay. And then those things are

727
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,960
straightforward to compute those L2

728
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,560
norms. And if you work if you compute

729
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,480
them you get that this is a this is I'll

730
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,079
put the sigma one out front.

731
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:30,400
And then it's the same thing a s S

732
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:32,720
complement over G.

733
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,520
Okay. So the true answer is the constant

734
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,200
term plus the high term which is like an

735
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,480
error term and whose size is at most

736
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,200
this. And if sigma 1 is strictly less

737
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,640
than one then the error term is strictly

738
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,240
smaller than the constant term. So

739
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,400
something will be left over and that's

740
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,400
the inequality.

741
00:40:51,359 --> 00:41:00,560
Okay, so let me make a little remark.

742
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:03,040
Um, if S is smaller than G over two,

743
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,960
then S complement is bigger than G

744
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,640
over2. So this is more or less without

745
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,800
loss of generality. You know, if you

746
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,720
switch the roles of S and S complement,

747
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,160
but it means S complement is at least G

748
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,680
over2, which means that this whole

749
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,560
fraction has order of one. So then we

750
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,440
get that the number of edges from S to S

751
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,960
complement is at least half sigma 1 of

752
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,319
TA

753
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,720
A time S. So it's at least uh a definite

754
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,240
fraction of all of the possible edges

755
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,720
that it could be living leaving us.

756
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,920
Okay. So this property here is called

757
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,920
being an expander graph

758
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,480
because if you take a set that's less

759
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,319
than half of the graph and then you add

760
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,560
to it all of the edges that are leaving

761
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,319
it then it will get significantly

762
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,720
bigger. It will expand. So it's called

763
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,280
an expander graph.

764
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,119
Okay.

765
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,200
Okay. Cool.

766
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,200
Um so so this proposition shows

767
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,000
that if this sigma one is strictly less

768
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,319
than one it's something like in Selber's

769
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,400
theorem then the edges in the graph

770
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,640
behave in this way that it's an expanded

771
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,040
graph.

772
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,040
Okay, cool.

773
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,319
Okay, now so Selberg did not state his

774
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,200
theorem in this way. So this is slightly

775
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,119
ahistorical, but Selberg's theorem plus

776
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,560
things that are not very difficult in

777
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:38,319
hindsight show that this kaly graph of

778
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,240
SL2FP is an expander graph and it is in

779
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,760
a sense the first Zelberg didn't quite

780
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,680
say this but in a sense this was the

781
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,960
first proof that any graph was an

782
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:50,640
expander graph. Um, expander graphs were

783
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,560
officially defined in 1970 by Pinsker

784
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,960
and something pretty close by Koma Garf

785
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,839
and Bars in the 60s and all of those

786
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,720
people realized that um random graphs

787
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,720
were expander graphs.

788
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,920
Um,

789
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,000
yeah. So I maybe many people have seen

790
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,160
but it's really a remarkable thing. So,

791
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,440
so just for comparison, like a simple

792
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,200
graph that we might think of that we can

793
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,480
easily visualize would be like a like an

794
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,119
n byn grid and that kind of graph is not

795
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,000
an expander at all. So an n byn grid has

796
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,160
n squared vertices but you can cut it in

797
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,920
half with a vertical line and you only

798
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,520
cut n edges. So the number of edges so s

799
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,280
and s complement are each about half of

800
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,720
the graph. The number of edges between

801
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,560
them is is much smaller than s. Um so

802
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,160
these are very large graphs but the

803
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,720
number of edges it takes to cut it in

804
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,440
half is comparable to all of the edges

805
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,119
and um it most graphs are like that but

806
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,960
before people realized it it was

807
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,040
surprising and counterintuitive that any

808
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,000
graphs were like that and it's very

809
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,160
significant fact in many domains of math

810
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,160
and science.

811
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,800
Okay.

812
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,000
Uh okay, let me pause there and

813
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:13,000
questions about about Selberg's theorem

814
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and this setup mixing and expansion.

815
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,200
>> The point of a generators is just so

816
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:27,359
that it's connected.

817
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,000
>> Yes, that's right. So um so the question

818
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,400
is uh is what what is the point of a

819
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,400
being generators?

820
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,599
[Applause]

821
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,839
So if a did not generate the group then

822
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,079
this graph would be disconnected and

823
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:50,240
then it wouldn't mix at all. Um so make

824
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,119
a remark

825
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,359
suppose that A is in a finite group and

826
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,640
that H

827
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:03,760
the so the the subgroup

828
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:06,760
generated by A is H which is a proper

829
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,760
subgroup.

830
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,520
Okay. So then if we take TA and we apply

831
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,000
it to the characteristic function of

832
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,240
this subgroup since all of these guys

833
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,079
are in the subgroup we would just stay

834
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,079
in the subgroup. So this would be 1 H.

835
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,359
Okay. And um and that implies with a

836
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,599
teeny bit of work that sigma 1 of TA

837
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,599
would be one.

838
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,200
Right? So, okay, one thing we could see

839
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,040
is that no matter how many times we

840
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,040
repeat this operation, we will never mix

841
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,880
over the whole group because we'll never

842
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,640
get out of H. And so, based on what

843
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,960
we've seen before, um, this should be

844
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
one.

845
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,280
Yeah.

846
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,280
>> Just make a big does it just make the

847
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,640
graph more

848
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,400
likely to be an expander?

849
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,720
>> Yeah. So, the question is, if we make a

850
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,280
big, is the graph more likely to be an

851
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,280
expander? Um

852
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,720
perhaps if we so we could we could take

853
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,520
a big and then it would um so we're so

854
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,280
we're allowed to take a big and um we

855
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,359
will talk in a little bit about what

856
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,880
what we can say if we just know that a

857
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,040
is big what does that tell us about

858
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,960
sigma of ta we'll we'll talk about that

859
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,440
right

860
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,520
okay so another remark I wanted to make

861
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,040
is that the first proof of this theorem

862
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,200
was very difficult so the first proof

863
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,520
depended on. So it had some interesting

864
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,119
analysis related to hyperbolic geometry

865
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,960
but then it depended on the remon

866
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,960
hypothesis for curves over finite

867
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,960
fields.

868
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,800
So that's a you know a beautiful and

869
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,240
important theorem but if you wanted to

870
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,520
include the whole proof of that then the

871
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,599
proof of this theorem is effectively

872
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,119
several hundred pages long and has a lot

873
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:59,040
of algebraic geometry. Um and in around

874
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:02,920
the early 1990s, Sarnac and Shuer gave a

875
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,920
much simpler proof.

876
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,920
Uh which is the proof that we'll talk

877
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,920
about.

878
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Okay.

879
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,040
Okay. Okay. So in the rest of the class

880
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:26,079
I will start to describe the uh proof by

881
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:31,000
Sarn and and Shuer um uh and and

882
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,000
introduce the first the first key idea.

883
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,000
All right.

884
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,160
Okay. Um

885
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,839
so first idea

886
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,040
this idea has to do with the

887
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:53,480
representation theory

888
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,480
of the group SL2FP

889
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,240
it's a proposition

890
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:04,640
okay so if we have a representation so a

891
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:07,040
representation is a group homorphism

892
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,839
to uh this is a unitary representation

893
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:16,079
so to the unitary group in D dimensions.

894
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:19,800
So this is a representation

895
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,800
need a group homorphism

896
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,960
um and okay and let me so there there's

897
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,240
the trivial representation where

898
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,599
everything goes to the identity but let

899
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,200
me say it is a non-trivial

900
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,720
representation

901
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:39,960
um then actually d needs to be quite big

902
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,960
d is at least p + 1 over

903
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,599
Okay,

904
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,520
so before we prove this theorem, let's

905
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,760
try to put it in context by trying to

906
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,000
think about group representations.

907
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,760
Um, where would we find a group

908
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,760
representation?

909
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,599
Okay, well SL2FP acts on itself. So it

910
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:09,680
acts on the space that we started with

911
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:14,240
L2 of G. So, so any so any group G

912
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,599
acts on L2 G by the action that we sort

913
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,040
of wrote down. You take a function and

914
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,359
you like shift the space under it.

915
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,040
Okay, that action is not trivial. So the

916
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,960
only only the constant functions are

917
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,880
fixed. So that's a non-trivial action.

918
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,920
And the dimension of this space is the

919
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,720
cardality of G. So for this group that

920
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,079
would be about P cubed.

921
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:39,079
So cardality of SL2

922
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,079
FP.

923
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,960
Okay. Um

924
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,640
what else? Well, if you have a subgroup

925
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,599
of G,

926
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:54,480
H is a subgroup

927
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:59,040
of G. Then um G acts

928
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,280
on G mod H and so it acts

929
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,720
acts on this as a set and so it acts on

930
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:09,440
L2 of G mod H by a unitary

931
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:12,480
representation and so the dimension

932
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,440
of L2 of GH

933
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,599
is the cardality of G mod which is the

934
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,319
cardality of G divided by the cardality

935
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,480
of H.

936
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,720
Okay, so let's think of some subgroups

937
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,720
of SL2FP.

938
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,880
Think of there's the diagonal subgroup

939
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,880
looks like this.

940
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:46,000
The size of the diagonal subgroup is

941
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,839
around P. There's the unipotent subgroup

942
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,079
looks like this. Size of the unipotent

943
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,760
subgroup is P.

944
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,040
And you could sort of mix these

945
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,440
together. So there's the upper

946
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,800
triangular subgroup. Uh but we already

947
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,880
used the letter U. So I'm going to call

948
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:03,920
this B for Burell. Uh so I'll write it A

949
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,079
A inverse T.

950
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,000
That's a subgroup. And the size of the

951
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,800
upper triangle subgroup is around P^

952
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,280
squ. So that's the biggest one that we

953
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:20,680
have come up with here. And if you plug

954
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,680
this in here, uh so if you take SL2FP,

955
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:29,079
that's around P. And so this is uh the

956
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,079
right order of magnitude.

957
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,359
Okay. And this is an interesting fact

958
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,440
about this group which is extremely

959
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:41,359
different from a billion groups. So for

960
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,040
for an aelion group uh every irreducible

961
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,079
representation is onedimensional. So

962
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,559
there are lots and lots of

963
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,880
representations where D is one. But for

964
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,079
SL2FP life is very different. All of

965
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,800
them have very large dimension.

966
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:58,839
Okay.

967
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,839
So let's prove this theorem.

968
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,400
Uh so I had heard about this theorem

969
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,319
years ago and I always assumed that to

970
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,079
prove this theorem one had to study a

971
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,160
lot of representation theory and I was a

972
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,680
little intimidated by it. Uh but then I

973
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,359
read the proof as I was getting ready to

974
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,520
teach this class and actually it it

975
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,000
doesn't require anything that's outside

976
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,720
of uh you know a good a good

977
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,359
undergraduate algebra curriculum

978
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,359
and it's quite elegant.

979
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:36,640
All right. So here's the proof. Um,

980
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,480
so we're going to focus on this matrix

981
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,240
for a little while and try to figure out

982
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,319
what the representation does with this

983
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,839
matrix.

984
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:48,880
So let's suppose for now

985
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:51,880
that row of this matrix is not just the

986
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,880
identity.

987
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,160
Um,

988
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,599
actually let me let me say it in a

989
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:03,520
different order. So let's say so U is

990
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:07,119
that matrix and V is this matrix which

991
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:10,480
is very similar to U and we'll make the

992
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,559
remark that so exercise this point I

993
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,040
won't include the details U and V

994
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,040
generate

995
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,040
SL2

996
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,240
okay if you play around a little bit you

997
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,000
you can see this all right so therefore

998
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,119
if we have a non-trivial representation

999
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,839
these cannot both go to the identity.

1000
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,839
So row is non-trivial.

1001
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:39,200
So either row of u or row of v is not

1002
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,800
the identity. And u and v are so similar

1003
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,119
to each other it doesn't really matter

1004
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,200
which one. So I'm going to say

1005
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:49,559
essentially without loss of generality

1006
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,559
row of u is not the identity.

1007
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,359
All right. Now let's think about row of

1008
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,359
u. Um

1009
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:10,160
there's something quite special about

1010
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:14,160
this matrix which is um

1011
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:17,760
um that it is conjugate

1012
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:21,520
to powers of itself.

1013
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:25,280
Let me write that down. So suppose take

1014
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:28,160
a diagonal matrix A a inverse. I put

1015
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,000
this matrix in the middle

1016
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,839
and then I want to conjugate it. So now

1017
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,200
I put on the other side the inverse.

1018
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:37,920
Right? So this is the conjugate of my

1019
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,559
matrix U.

1020
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:44,640
Okay.

1021
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:47,920
So I multiply this by this. Uh I

1022
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:53,200
multiply the top row by a and the bottom

1023
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:58,440
row by a inverse. So I get a a z a

1024
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,440
inverse. And then I still have this guy.

1025
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,720
Now when I multiply these matrices

1026
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,400
together, I multiply the left column by

1027
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:13,440
a inverse and the right column by a.

1028
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:16,440
The diagonals cancel, but I get one 01

1029
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,440
a².

1030
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Okay.

1031
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:33,839
So see that u is conjugate

1032
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,440
to

1033
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:41,720
u to the power a squ

1034
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,720
and this is for any a

1035
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,359
right.

1036
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,559
So that is a special and really

1037
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:59,200
interesting feature of this element of

1038
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:02,400
my group.

1039
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:10,160
And so now I have a representation and

1040
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:14,559
row of u is conjugate to row of u of a 2

1041
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,400
which is row of u to the a 2. So now I

1042
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,559
have a matrix I have a unitary matrix

1043
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,520
and it is conjugate to a big power of

1044
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:24,000
itself.

1045
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,799
Okay, in the world of matrices, it's not

1046
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,160
so easy to get that to happen. So, this

1047
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:33,280
group has a has an interesting property

1048
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:36,640
that has an element which is conjugate

1049
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,359
to many different powers of itself.

1050
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,680
And in matrices, it's not so easy to

1051
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:44,240
find a matrix which is conjugate to many

1052
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,960
different powers of itself.

1053
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,920
Why? because

1054
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,680
uh uh- because of how the igen values

1055
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,520
behave.

1056
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,680
So

1057
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,680
okay. So so now let's think about IGEN

1058
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,680
values.

1059
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:09,800
[Applause]

1060
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,640
Okay.

1061
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:44,680
So

1062
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,680
row of U is U of D is a matrix.

1063
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:56,640
And if row of u is conjugate to row of u

1064
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,599
to the a^2

1065
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:03,680
then that tells us that the igen values

1066
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:10,559
the spectrum of row of u is the same as

1067
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:12,480
the igen values of row of u to the a^ 2.

1068
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,319
Two conjugate matrices have the same

1069
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,960
igen values.

1070
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:19,440
But if you take a matrix and raise it to

1071
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:23,119
a power, the igen values are all raised

1072
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:29,240
to a power. So this is the igen values

1073
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,240
of row of u to the a 2.

1074
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,200
Okay.

1075
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,200
Okay. So for instance, you could take a

1076
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,559
to be two and it tells you if you have

1077
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,400
an igen value of row of u you raise it

1078
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,319
to the fourth power that will also be an

1079
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,119
igen value of row of u. And you can keep

1080
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:51,160
doing that. And it's not just four. We

1081
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,160
have many choices for a squ.

1082
00:58:51,920 --> 00:59:00,640
Okay. So let's think about what the igen

1083
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:04,880
values of row of u may be like. So study

1084
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,480
values of row of u. So this is an an

1085
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,240
amazing fact about them. And there's a

1086
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,280
more pedestrian fact that we should also

1087
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,359
observe. We know that u to the p is the

1088
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,200
identity.

1089
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:18,240
And therefore

1090
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,920
row of u to the p is the identity. So

1091
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:25,440
then if lambda is an igen value of row

1092
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,640
of u then we get that lambda to the p is

1093
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:33,079
the is one. Okay. So the igen values of

1094
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,079
row of u they're all p roots of unity.

1095
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,839
Um

1096
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:44,160
right so we get the following. If lambda

1097
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:48,880
is an igen value of row of u then lambda

1098
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:54,760
to the p is one and lambda to the a 2 is

1099
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,760
also an igen value of row of u.

1100
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:04,079
Okay.

1101
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,040
So

1102
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:10,559
um since lambda to the p is one, we only

1103
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,640
care about a^2 mod p. So could put mod p

1104
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,599
there.

1105
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:20,240
Um and um

1106
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:23,040
there are p min -1 / 2 quadratic

1107
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,880
residues

1108
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,640
mod p.

1109
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,640
So this a^ squ mod p. It could be any

1110
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,119
quadratic residue mod p. There are p

1111
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,520
minus one over two of them. And if you

1112
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,520
take a p of unity and you raise it to a

1113
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,240
power it's between one and p you'll

1114
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:42,480
you'll change it. So so lambda is a

1115
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:44,880
primitive. So if lambda is not one

1116
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,880
then lambda is a primitive p root of

1117
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,880
unity

1118
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:56,799
and that tells us that the lambda to the

1119
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:59,440
a^ 2 mod p are all distinct

1120
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:02,400
for the p minus one over two quadratic

1121
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,200
reserves.

1122
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,119
Okay, so we now have seen that that

1123
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,280
there are an awful lot of different igen

1124
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,920
values which can only happen if the

1125
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:15,599
matrix is in a large dimension.

1126
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:19,160
So that gives us that d is at least p +

1127
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,160
1 / 2.

1128
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:25,440
Okay, actually I so how do we know that

1129
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:28,400
row of u has a not an igen value that's

1130
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,119
not one? Well, if all the igen values

1131
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,960
were one, then row of u you you could is

1132
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,559
conjugate to a matrix with ones on the

1133
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,040
diagonals and some upper triangular

1134
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:40,799
stuff. And if you raise that to a power,

1135
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:42,480
you'll never get the identity. Um

1136
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:46,720
an exercise. So there's a little a

1137
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:51,200
little something where exercise.

1138
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:54,240
If um the igen values of row of u are

1139
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,760
exactly the set one

1140
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,680
and

1141
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:02,319
row of u to the p = 1 then row of u is

1142
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:06,520
the identity

1143
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,520
I I'll leave the matrix details.

1144
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,240
Okay.

1145
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:22,160
So all the representations of SL2 are

1146
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:25,960
really big. Why does that matter?

1147
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,960
Let's do another proposition.

1148
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,599
So proposition two

1149
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,280
you take sigma 1 of t mu. So mu is a

1150
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:53,880
measure on

1151
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,880
probability measure on SL2 FP.

1152
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:02,960
Then sigma 1 of this guy if you square

1153
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:07,680
it and you multiply by D +1 / 2 that is

1154
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:12,200
at most the size of SL2FP

1155
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:12,200
times mu L2.

1156
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:19,039
Simplifying the algebra a little bit,

1157
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:21,039
sigma 1 of t mu^2 is smaller than around

1158
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,760
1 over p^2

1159
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,760
time mu l2.

1160
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,640
Okay.

1161
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,640
All right. So we come back to the

1162
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,559
question from earlier in the class. How

1163
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,160
are singular values related to igen

1164
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:45,680
values?

1165
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:51,200
So sigma i of t mu

1166
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:56,559
squared is lambda i of t mu t mu star.

1167
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:59,119
It's the ien value of this matrix.

1168
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:02,720
And the key observation is that the igen

1169
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:05,119
spaces of this matrix have a g action on

1170
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,200
them. And except for the constant

1171
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:12,760
functions the igen spaces are not

1172
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,760
trivial. Here's the key

1173
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:22,799
spaces

1174
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:26,000
of t mu t mu star have a g action

1175
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:27,839
and except for

1176
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,400
the constant functions. So the constant

1177
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:32,480
functions are an igen space of t mu tu

1178
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:36,119
star but all the other ones it's a

1179
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,119
non-trivial action.

1180
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,559
Let's suppose that for a moment and see

1181
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,559
why it's helpful and then we can think

1182
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,640
more carefully about what exactly are

1183
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,640
the igen spaces.

1184
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,640
Um.

1185
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,880
All right.

1186
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:05,079
Um

1187
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:16,319
Okay.

1188
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:19,319
Um so that tells us that sig each sigma

1189
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,319
i

1190
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:26,400
has a multiplicity

1191
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:28,400
which is at least d + 1 / 2.

1192
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,079
So you have and we really care about the

1193
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,240
biggest one, this biggest singular

1194
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,520
vector. There's not just one biggest

1195
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:38,160
singular vector, but there's a a whole

1196
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,920
singular subspace of a big dimension and

1197
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,640
all of those vectors have have this

1198
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,799
large singular value.

1199
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:48,960
Okay. So now another uh fact from linear

1200
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:53,200
algebra is that if you add up the

1201
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:56,520
singular values squared of a of a matrix

1202
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,520
with multiplicity

1203
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,680
that is the Hilbert Schmidt norm of the

1204
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,599
matrix. So it's the sum of the entries

1205
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:06,599
of the matrix.

1206
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,599
Uh

1207
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,400
so this is a matrix where the rows and

1208
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,839
columns are indexed by our group G. So

1209
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:23,720
it has an entry G1 G2 and it's the sum

1210
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,720
of the entries squared.

1211
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,160
Does this look familiar to people from

1212
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,599
linear algebra?

1213
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:42,319
Okay. Okay. Now the entries of our

1214
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:43,839
matrix we can read off. It's the sum g1

1215
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:47,760
g2

1216
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:49,440
mu of something like g1 g2 inverse. This

1217
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,799
might not be exactly right but it's the

1218
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,520
right idea.

1219
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:56,000
>> Uh that's that's the entry and then

1220
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:59,039
we're squaring it.

1221
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:04,280
Um and so that's the size of the group

1222
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:04,280
times the sum of mu of g^2.

1223
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,440
Okay, so that's the right hand side

1224
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,119
and over here we're counting with

1225
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,799
multiplicity and the multiplicity is

1226
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:23,799
always large. So this is at least d + 1

1227
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:23,799
/ 2 * sigma 1 of t mu^ 2

1228
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,559
So there's an important difference

1229
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,200
between the sigma 1 and the sigma 0. The

1230
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,760
sigma 0 went with the constant functions

1231
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,760
that lives in a space of dimension one.

1232
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:43,520
But anybody else lives in a big

1233
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:46,319
dimensional space. And so this uh counts

1234
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:50,359
get gets counted many times. Um and and

1235
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:50,359
that changes the playing field.

1236
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:03,240
Um, what is D?

1237
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,240
>> What is D? Sorry. D is P. Sorry.

1238
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:09,680
Thank you.

1239
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,200
Okay. Is it right up there? Yeah. So, D

1240
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,480
is the dimension of the representation,

1241
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,760
but um that's why I put it, but it's a

1242
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,440
it was just a mistake. It's supposed to

1243
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:21,359
be P+ one over two.

1244
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,600
So what needs to be spelled out more

1245
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,120
carefully?

1246
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,960
I think we should just spell out a

1247
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,679
little more carefully why the spaces

1248
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,679
have this G action.

1249
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:02,239
Okay, so first of all, what is T mu

1250
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:05,679
star? Let's say mu star of g is just mu

1251
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:07,440
of g inverse. And if you write down the

1252
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:11,199
definition of the adjint and play around

1253
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:15,920
a little bit, you'll see that t mu star

1254
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:20,080
is just t of u star convoling with you.

1255
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:22,560
So t mu t mu star of that is just you

1256
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:25,759
take f you convolve it with mu star and

1257
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:31,400
then you convolve it with mu. So it's t

1258
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,400
of uh mu convolve with mu star.

1259
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:38,000
Okay so our oper our operator is still

1260
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,199
just a convolution operator just

1261
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,239
convolving by something slightly

1262
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,759
different. And now we want to see that

1263
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:46,239
convolution

1264
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:48,239
uh commutes with the some symmetries of

1265
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:50,880
of g.

1266
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:54,480
Um okay so our convolution has been

1267
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,760
defined to be on the right and so I

1268
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:59,040
think it's supposed to commute with the

1269
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:05,679
symmetries of of f on the left. So let's

1270
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:07,679
say f the left action of g on f of h is

1271
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:11,480
f of

1272
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,480
g inverse h.

1273
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:19,600
I want to say that uh convolution

1274
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:21,840
commutes with this action. So I want to

1275
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:26,679
say claim

1276
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,679
that for for any measure new

1277
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:38,239
if I take T new of left action G of F

1278
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:39,920
this is left action G T new of F.

1279
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:41,199
Okay, cross my finger that I wrote

1280
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,360
everything correctly so that this is

1281
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:49,920
true.

1282
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:51,520
uh t new of left action g of f at some

1283
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,719
um

1284
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:57,760
let's say I evaluate that at x.

1285
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:01,440
So the I'm going to convolve this

1286
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:07,199
function with new. So it's lgf convolved

1287
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:10,080
with new at x. So it's the sum x1 x2 = x

1288
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:13,640
lf of x1

1289
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,640
new of x2.

1290
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:22,880
So that's the sum x1 x2 = x f of g

1291
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,199
inverse x1

1292
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,199
new of x2.

1293
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:33,600
All right. So the product of these two

1294
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:37,040
guys is g inverse x.

1295
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:41,960
So really the product x1 tilda time x2

1296
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,960
tilda is g inverse x

1297
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:51,159
um f of x1 tilda new of x2 tilda.

1298
01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:00,000
So that is t new of f evaluated at g

1299
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:07,159
inverse x.

1300
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,159
So that's lg of t new of f x

1301
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,080
probably can see that I'm not a very

1302
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,760
algebraically minded person. I think

1303
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,080
there's probably a high sort of more

1304
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,600
highbrow proof of this. So something

1305
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,960
about acting on the left commutes with

1306
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,960
acting on the right.

1307
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,760
Okay. So,

1308
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,239
so the group

1309
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,239
commutes the group acts on functions and

1310
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:36,560
that action commutes with this. So, if

1311
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:40,360
you have an igen space of this, the

1312
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,360
group will act on it.

1313
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:51,199
So if t new of f is lambda f then t new

1314
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:56,080
of lgf

1315
01:12:51,199 --> 01:13:00,560
will be lg t new of f which is lg of

1316
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:04,080
lambda f which is lambda lg of f.

1317
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:10,120
So LG so G

1318
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:10,120
acts on V lambda the space.

1319
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:18,199
Okay. So that fleshes out

1320
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,199
this.

1321
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:26,360
[Applause]

1322
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,360
Okay.

1323
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,280
Cool. So um let's do a quick application

1324
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,440
of this to see what we have learned

1325
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:38,159
about mixing.

1326
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:40,719
So remember that we already know that

1327
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,400
this thing is bounded by one and it's

1328
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,199
not at all clear whether this is bigger

1329
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,679
or smaller than one. It depends upon mu.

1330
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:50,239
Um if this is bigger than one then this

1331
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,760
is kind of useless. But if this is

1332
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:54,480
smaller than one then it gives us some

1333
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:57,480
new information.

1334
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,480
Okay,

1335
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,880
one question about proposition 2.

1336
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,520
>> Yeah.

1337
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:13,679
>> Does it require the existence of a

1338
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:17,679
representation of degree P + 1 /2?

1339
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:20,159
>> Uh not exactly. I mean this oper this

1340
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:22,080
operator here has spaces

1341
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:23,840
>> and we know that the group acts on them.

1342
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,239
So therefore there are representations

1343
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,239
of this group.

1344
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,760
Okay.

1345
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,760
So application.

1346
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:41,120
So suppose a is a subset of SL2FP.

1347
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,840
It doesn't have to be a Selberg just any

1348
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:48,120
subset. And remember that mu of A is the

1349
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,120
uniform measure on A.

1350
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:57,120
Okay. So what is mu of a L2 squared?

1351
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:59,760
Well, we square the amplitude of 1 / a^2

1352
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:03,440
and then we add it up and we'll get a

1353
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:06,719
contribution from a points. So we get

1354
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:10,400
one over the cardality of a

1355
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:14,560
right. So if we just plug in our our uh

1356
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:18,159
estimate, proposition two

1357
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:21,360
tells us that sigma 1 of ta squared is

1358
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:24,679
bounded by um

1359
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,679
p ^2.

1360
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,840
Whoops,

1361
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:33,120
I did that wrong. That's not good.

1362
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:36,560
This is about p cub. This is about p.

1363
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:38,159
Okay, good. So it's bounded by p ^2 over

1364
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,560
a.

1365
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:43,840
So we can see

1366
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:50,719
that if a is significantly bigger than p

1367
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:55,280
^2 then sigma 1 of ta is less than one.

1368
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:56,880
So a is 10 p ^2 or even better p 2 plus

1369
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,960
epsilon

1370
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,760
then sigma 1 is quite a bit less than

1371
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:05,040
one and so this this walk this random

1372
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:10,159
walk will mix. Great.

1373
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:14,960
Um in particular corlary of that is that

1374
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:17,760
if H is a proper subgroup

1375
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,840
of SL2FP

1376
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,360
so we saw earlier take a proper subgroup

1377
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,760
and you you walk you just stay in the

1378
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:27,600
subgroup it won't mix at all sigma 1

1379
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:31,719
would be one um then H has size which is

1380
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,719
smaller than around P ^2

1381
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:36,000
and we saw earlier that there is a

1382
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:39,000
subgroup of size about P^2. So this is

1383
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
sharp.

1384
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,960
Okay. So this addresses the question

1385
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:49,280
that was raised earlier. The set A may

1386
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:52,640
be large. If you just know the size of

1387
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:54,640
A, can you say whether it mixes or not?

1388
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,480
Um this is essentially a sharp answer to

1389
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:59,360
that question. If A is significantly

1390
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:03,600
bigger than P^2, then the random walk

1391
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:05,280
does mix. And if a is smaller than p ^2,

1392
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,960
a could live in a subgroup and the

1393
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,800
random walk may not mix.

1394
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,000
This whole phenomenon is is is quite

1395
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,120
different from what would happen in a

1396
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,800
commutive group. Um in a commutive

1397
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:20,960
group, you could take very large subsets

1398
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,400
and still nothing might mix. Um

1399
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,840
partly because the commutive group might

1400
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,719
have very large subgroups, but even if

1401
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,800
it doesn't, it wouldn't work.

1402
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,719
Yeah.

1403
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,400
Cool.

1404
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,400
Okay, so that's all very interesting,

1405
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,679
but it doesn't look very close to this

1406
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,520
theorem yet because this is theorem says

1407
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,560
that we get mixing if our subset has

1408
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:45,679
size larger than P ^2 and this is a

1409
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:48,960
subset of size four. So we will have to

1410
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:51,199
think some more uh about how to do this

1411
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,199
and we will talk about that uh next

1412
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,199
time.
