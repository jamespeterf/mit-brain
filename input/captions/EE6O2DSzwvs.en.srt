Hi, my name is Graham and I wanted to

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,040
share a bit about my educational journey

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,080
with MIT open learning. I've loved doing

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,120
math since middle school, but after

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,720
learning calculus, I didn't really know

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,000
where to go next. However, a couple

7
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,120
summers ago, a professor that I know

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
recommended that I watch Gilbert

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,480
String's 18.06 linear algebra lectures

10
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,839
online. After seeing everything else

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,119
that open courseware had to offer, I

12
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,560
immediately had tons more math that I

13
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,680
wanted to learn about. That same

14
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,199
professor told me that it's important to

15
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
learn math in multiple different ways.

16
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,600
And so, in keeping with that, open

17
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
learning has become a very useful tool

18
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,320
for me to learn with in addition to

19
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,840
other resources like textbooks. When I

20
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
first started real analysis, the worked

21
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,599
examples in the 1800A lectures helped me

22
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
make sense of a subject that felt

23
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,800
completely new. Later, when I started

24
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,399
functional analysis, the intuitive

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
explanations in the 18102 lectures

26
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,600
helped me grow my understanding beyond

27
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,719
what textbooks could offer. Open

28
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,160
Learning has helped me grow my passion

29
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,360
for math, something I now try to share

30
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,960
through clubs I run at my school,

31
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,160
offering free tutoring, doing research,

32
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
and hopefully eventually becoming a

33
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,800
professor of math. Thank you, Open

34
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,800
Learning, for helping make this

35
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,800
possible.
