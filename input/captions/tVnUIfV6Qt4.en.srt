1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,759
Let me now introduce Professor Dame

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,080
Fiona Murray. Fiona is the associate

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,080
dean of innovation at the MIT Sloan

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
School of Management and she is the

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,320
William Porter Professor of

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,039
Entrepreneurship within the Sloan

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,920
School. Fiona, over to you.

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,920
>> Brilliant. Thank you very much, Ron. Um,

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,439
it's really a pleasure to be joining

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,119
ILP. Uh, my name is Fiona Murray. As Ron

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
said, I've actually been an MIT faculty

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,320
member for over 25 years, and that has

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,239
meant 25 years of partnership with ILP.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
Uh really having the opportunity not

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,120
only to pursue the sort of frontiers of

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,879
knowledge and research, but work with

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,800
corporate partners, government partners,

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,640
and others to make sure that our ideas

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,160
really make a difference in the world.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,760
And I'm especially pleased that in this

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,320
webinar I'll be joined by my colleague

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,079
and co-author, Dr. Phil Buden. uh we've

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
had the opportunity to do uh a

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
significant body of work together and uh

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,399
what we're talking about today uh is

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,800
very much grounded in our book um

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
accelerating innovation. But what I want

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,680
to do is sort of take a few minutes at

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,520
the beginning to sort of set the scene

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,600
and particularly to pick up on this

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
topic of innovation in the context of

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,080
this era of geopolitics. So I wonder Ron

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
with permission from you if I might

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,400
share my slides.

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
So, as I've said, I want to talk about

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,040
innovation in this era of geopolitics. I

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,360
don't think I'm going to need to really

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,119
persuade any of you that we really are

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,640
in a new phase. Um, many things are

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,720
going to characterize this, but I think

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,479
there are at least three. One is

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,000
absolutely the sense that we have moved

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,640
into a period of great power

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,880
competition, particularly between uh the

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,759
United States and China. This is

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,240
something really very novel for our

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,799
generation and for our organizations to

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,960
be confronted I think with a peer

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,040
adversary. Uh secondly, there's sort of

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,439
tension and complexity between

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,799
traditional allies. So you'll see here

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,799
this nice headline from the Financial

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,600
Times, the US needs a new geopolitical

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,200
comp compass. As we think about the

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,719
relationship amongst allies and

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
partners,

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,440
those relationships are continually

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
being rewired. I just came back from the

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,280
NATO summit and you could really see

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
some of that in action uh in all the

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
meetings that were taking place. And

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
third, of course, we are in a period

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
where there are a number of wars around

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,080
the globe uh not least uh the Ukraine

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
war. And so those at least those three

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
things together are absolutely sort of

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,879
creating a heightened sense of the sort

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
of complexities of geopolitics.

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,120
And I would say that more than any other

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,120
period, this new era puts um sort of

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
economics, innovation, industrialization

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,640
in the spotlight. We've often

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,160
traditionally thought about geopolitics

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
as something that really does affect

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
governments. It's a thing that causes

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,519
governments to talk to each other and

77
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
engage in different ways. Or it might be

78
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,519
something that sort of shapes very

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,800
narrow set of industries. But today we

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,360
see not only um economics and innovation

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
really being at the heart of war. Uh

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
think about the implications for

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,560
Ukraine's economy and Russia's frankly

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
of um the ongoing war. But it's also

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
meant that in some industries that are

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
considered particularly strategic for

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
example you know rare earths and mining

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,720
you know an industry that has always

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,720
been sort of royal by politics in the

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,800
particular locations but that's one now

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,599
absolutely sharply in the spotlight as

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,000
you see Pentagon moving to sort of

93
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,159
secure the US rare earth uh mineral

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
needs but also how we think about

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
dependence on technology and whether or

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
not if you're based in Europe as you

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
know I spend much time in Europe and the

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,480
UK as does Phil um you know how we

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,799
really understand that and so these are

100
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,280
ongoing and very rapidly moving kind of

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,959
questions and so again but why why now

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,120
what is it particularly that means that

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
I believe that in every boardroom in

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,159
every investment committee and every

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
startup accelerator geopolitics has to

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,760
be on the agenda and we need this new

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
geopolitical calculus through which to

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,400
make our decisions around innovation

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,319
industrialization um and investment well

110
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
you know so we we see this sort of not

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,720
only entering ing the boardroom but also

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,879
the ecosystem these places where

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,959
innovation is absolutely being generated

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
and it is affecting these key five

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,319
stakeholders. These are the five

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,160
stakeholders that in the work that Phil

117
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,799
and I have done together we see as

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,880
absolutely essential to driving the

119
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,720
ingenuity the experimentation of early

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,280
stage innovation and each one is going

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,720
to be shaped by uh the geopolitical

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,600
environment around them. Now you know

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
again we might say why today and what is

124
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
it that makes this particularly

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,639
difficult as a calculus? why do we have

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
to talk about it as opposed to saying

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,320
all right you know there's a very narrow

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,400
number of industries they're going to

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,479
become more important when I think it

130
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,800
actually goes back to something that um

131
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,199
was really an observation that Phil made

132
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,440
um he often and I hope we pick this up

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,680
Phil in a fireside chat portion talks

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
about the fact that um Tom Freeman wrote

135
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,320
this quite interesting book in 2005 the

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
world is flat and we know very well and

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,560
what was he was really talking about was

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,400
globalization now by 2025 it's very

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
clear that at least for innovation It's

140
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
not flat. It's actually highly

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
distributed across the world um in

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
places that we call innovation

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
ecosystems. These places that have very

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
high concentrations of innovative

145
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
activity. You'll see from this map,

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
these are ecosystems that we've worked

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
with through our regional

148
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,039
entrepreneurship acceleration program.

149
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,880
These ecosystems are no longer just in

150
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,440
Silicon Valley and Boston. They are

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,600
distributed worldwide. And that's going

152
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
to be really important as you accelerate

153
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,440
innovation and build competitive

154
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
advantage through your ecosystem

155
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,360
engagement. And that's really the topic

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,120
of our book. But at the same time, not

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,880
all locations are created equal from a

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,479
geopolitical point of view. Engaging

159
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
with some of them has become more

160
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,080
complicated. Engaging with others has

161
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
become more preferable from the

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,320
perspective of our various governments.

163
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,240
And even more so, the industrial base

164
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,320
that sort of connects them all together

165
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
is itself extraordinarily globalized.

166
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,479
And so these decisions are sort of being

167
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,440
made on a changing global terrain that

168
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,160
it's worth us thinking about. Now the

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,160
other thing I would say um is that it's

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,240
the first time really in recent history

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
that the US has faced a peer adversary

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,919
with comparable expertise in technology

173
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,479
across a really wide range of

174
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,000
technological domains. Now you may say

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
hold on you know Russia was very good at

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
these two things and you know we were

177
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
always focused on for example nuclear

178
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,039
technology. What's particularly

179
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,199
interesting about China is its

180
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,280
extraordinary frontier innovation

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,400
capabilities in some very very important

182
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,560
areas of technology. Um it's not just

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,560
hypersonics, it's also in the life

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
sciences and increasingly it's in areas

185
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
like battery storage, hydrogen, bio

186
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
energy. The chart on the left shows you

187
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
some of the patents that have sort of

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,319
been increasing from Japan, China,

189
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,360
elsewhere, but particularly China, this

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,280
very rapid rise. Um if any of you have

191
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
read the New York Times this morning, uh

192
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,960
you'll see an article which very much

193
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,479
demonstrates that China is absolutely at

194
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,639
the forefront with clean energy

195
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
technology. And so we see this across

196
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,840
this wide range of technological domains

197
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
and we must take that very very

198
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,240
seriously. But the second I think is the

199
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
increasing use of this technological

200
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,800
interdependency that we are now for

201
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,720
example in the United States deeply

202
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
dependent upon China for example for

203
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,160
lithiumion batteries as a source of

204
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
power projection. So as we tap into

205
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,440
these ecosystems for ideas, as we tap

206
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,800
into these industrialized bases for you

207
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,039
know the supply chains and the

208
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,080
production particularly the supply

209
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,160
chains this allows countries to hold one

210
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,479
another sort of to ransom essentially

211
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,080
and we saw that when uh China halted

212
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,000
critical exports as the trade war

213
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,199
intensifies and so we absolutely see

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,039
this going on um as a new context that

215
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,039
really puts this geopolitical calculus

216
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,560
front and center.

217
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,240
I just want to give you a sort of a

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,759
couple of examples and so drones I think

219
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,360
are an important case in point. Um as

220
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
many of you know the war in Ukraine is

221
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
perhaps one of the first wars that has

222
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
been fought um around both the

223
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
sophisticated technology of drones but

224
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,599
frankly many of the drones being used

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
are hobbyist drones that have been sort

226
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,680
of adapted and changed. And so the real

227
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,280
opportunity here is both the innovation

228
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,919
that's happening but also the ability to

229
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,680
produce at scale. And yet the U the

230
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,160
Ukraine has found itself caught in the

231
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,759
middle of the US China trade hostilities

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
because it can't get all the parts that

233
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,680
it needs. And you might say, well, isn't

234
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
uh you know Ukraine getting its parts

235
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
from the United States for the the

236
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,080
drones or or from Europe? And the answer

237
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,000
turns out to basically be no. In the

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
work I did jointly with Edin Lavine,

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,599
you'll see this chart on the right that

240
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,120
basically says, well, is this inevitable

241
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
that every single one of the drone

242
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,919
components can basically largely only be

243
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
sourced at scale in China? And so we

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,680
sort of work backwards and say, well,

245
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
perhaps that's just because that's where

246
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,959
they were invented. And it turns out

247
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
that's not the case. That the ingenuity

248
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,760
and the origin of many of these ideas

249
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,000
was in the US, in Japan, uh, in Europe.

250
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,519
And yet now we've seen that sort of move

251
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,760
to the production of those things at

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,279
scale um, in China. And so this has

253
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
become, you know, very significant

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,640
challenge for Ukraine and something that

255
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,040
allied and partner governments are

256
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
thinking about very extensively as they

257
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,040
start to think about the sort of the

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,200
geopolitics of of that kind of map that

259
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,480
you see on the right hand side. And in

260
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,720
the work that Phil and I have done

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
understanding the um what's been

262
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,560
happening in Ukraine in terms of drone

263
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,160
design and development, we've absolutely

264
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,399
seen the role of their domestic

265
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
innovation ecosystem and them trying to

266
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,640
build up their own domestic industrial

267
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,680
base to actually support uh what they're

268
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,480
doing and certainly winning if you like

269
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,760
from the drone point of view but really

270
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,920
sort of constrained uh by the sort of

271
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,600
entangled supply chain. So this is a

272
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,120
sort of interesting case that reminds us

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
that at least in technology that's

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,279
relevant in defense. This is a big

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,040
challenge to deal with. Now most of our

276
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,720
organizations many of your corporations

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,480
will say look I'm not making defense

278
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
technology so this really doesn't apply

279
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,320
to me. But I want to sort of suggest

280
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
that with the role of economic

281
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,399
statecraft actually this is something

282
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,480
that most of our corporations really are

283
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
going to have to worry about. And we see

284
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
statecraftraft as having sort of two

285
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,720
faces. One is industrial policy that is

286
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,560
how are our governments trying to

287
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
support domestic industries that they

288
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,320
think is strategic. There's certainly a

289
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,079
sort of a playbook around more market

290
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
support and so on. I think that is

291
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
potentially quite powerful um and

292
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,279
requirements though for an industrial

293
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,160
base that is more domestic and more

294
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,240
resilient but also tools like export

295
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,240
controls, foreign investment provisions,

296
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,560
limits to foreign IP licensing. So

297
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,880
definitely a sort of entanglement

298
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,360
um of tools that we now have to

299
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,880
understand and and put into you know our

300
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
calculus as we think about making

301
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,399
important strategic decisions in our in

302
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,240
our boardrooms and in our senior

303
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,079
leadership team. And on the other side

304
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
we see statecraft as a sort of form of

305
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,680
foreign policy. And so that is

306
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,440
absolutely includes things like tariffs

307
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,279
and sanctions and limited limits to

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
outward capital flows as well as really

309
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,040
reframing economic relationships with

310
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
allies and partners. that is

311
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,040
particularly obviously at the moment a m

312
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,120
a moving uh target but something just

313
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,440
really worth thinking through. And I

314
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,320
want to just sort of leave us with a a a

315
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,640
couple of examples to say this is not

316
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,200
just for those uh organizations that are

317
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,600
thinking about traditional technologies

318
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,160
of defense and security that in fact

319
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,920
economic security is now seen across

320
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,680
this whole spectrum of technologies

321
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,000
whether it is sort of energy

322
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,240
technologies uh the technologies for

323
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,200
health and well-being so uh the life

324
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,480
sciences um whether it is you know some

325
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,839
of the most sort of fundamental

326
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,600
foundational technologies like

327
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,519
semiconductors and future quantum

328
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,519
computers. And so the the technological

329
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,040
landscape

330
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,200
that is going to be subject to this

331
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,360
economic statecraft I think is extremely

332
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,360
wide. And so let me just give you an

333
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
example. So if you were out there you

334
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,279
know as an entrepreneurial company this

335
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
is really something that you know we

336
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,760
never used to teach our startup

337
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,000
entrepreneurs to think about

338
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,320
geopolitics. We said have a great idea

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,880
build your company get the best talent

340
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,120
money market opportunities manufacturing

341
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,880
around the globe. and and we said to

342
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,040
them, look, really just try to be as

343
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,360
quick and as costefficient as possible.

344
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,720
But now the calculus is shifting. A

345
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,040
company like Commonwealth Fusion

346
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,240
Systems, a fusion energy company spun

347
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,160
out of MIT, um I shall never forget, you

348
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,920
know, visiting them with um a quite

349
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,959
senior member of a of a national

350
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,040
intelligence um organization who said to

351
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,120
them, "Have you thought about the threat

352
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,800
from hostile state actors?" And you

353
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
could see and this was many years ago

354
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,160
when this was a real startup

355
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,880
Commonwealth Fusion team looking a

356
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,320
little bit startled. Um but very quickly

357
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,639
having to deal with the fact that some

358
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,720
of their core technology like the high

359
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,120
temperature superconducting magnets you

360
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,040
know much of the provision of that

361
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,959
technology and that tape that they

362
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,680
needed for their core component this

363
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,079
extraordinary tokomeac was initially

364
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,000
only available at any quantity in Russia

365
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,399
and having to really sort of think about

366
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
those dynamics and I've recently done

367
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,040
some work again with my colleague Edelyn

368
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,279
and and others Dan and and Rory really

369
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,959
sort of raising the question will we

370
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,160
lose the race for fusion energy not

371
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,079
because we haven't actually built the

372
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,079
innovation ecosystem for the core

373
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,920
technology but because we haven't

374
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,760
actually attended to the wider supply

375
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,680
chain of some of those absolutely core

376
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,839
inputs and so if you're in industries

377
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,880
like um you know whether it be sort of

378
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,800
isotopes or power electronics then these

379
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,360
things really are going to matter as you

380
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,000
build your business and as you support

381
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680
these emerging industries of the future

382
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
unless we think that this is really a

383
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,279
topic that um is only for startups and

384
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,040
their investors to worry about. I I want

385
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,760
to come back to the fact that large

386
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,720
corporations are also thinking about

387
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,760
this. Boardrooms that I spend time in,

388
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,200
this is very very high up on the agenda.

389
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,399
There are lots of examples that we could

390
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,760
talk about. Some of them are

391
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,160
confidential. So I don't want to do

392
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,240
that. But I do want to give you um just

393
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,920
a sense of this if you put in your mind

394
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
right the fact that you know

395
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
particularly engagement with China but

396
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,839
also more broadly you know an

397
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,600
organization like Apple right has a

398
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,480
trade war problem that investors can't

399
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,000
ignore increasingly there are indices um

400
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,199
of corporate exposure to countries

401
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,440
through their supply chains and

402
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,079
manufacturing that just provides more

403
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
sort of geopolitical vulnerability and

404
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,440
as a large corporation as you think

405
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,440
about making acquisitions around the

406
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
world to tap into those global

407
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,279
ecosystems. Where are those countries?

408
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,120
How should you be thinking about that?

409
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,000
How do you think about the talent? What

410
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,519
about the sources of capital? And also,

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,959
how do you think about markets? So,

412
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,399
which markets do you want to participate

413
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,560
in? And that's before we layer on this

414
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,800
extremely moving target of tariffs. But

415
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,560
it very much I think is part and parcel

416
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,760
of you know a really different I think

417
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,000
set of conversations that we haven't had

418
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,360
in boardrooms in investment committees

419
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,600
you know in um in startup communities

420
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,480
really I think for decades or frankly

421
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,639
ever of this particular type. And so as

422
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,120
we start to try to sort of put the

423
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,360
ecosystem innovation ecosystem logic and

424
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,760
that logic of the sort of global

425
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,480
industrial base and industrial clusters

426
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,000
into this new geopolitical context, I

427
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,959
think we absolutely need this

428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
geopolitical calculus. Um as I say in

429
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,839
our boardrooms and elsewhere, this is

430
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,440
not just a calculus that is for

431
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,040
government officials. It's absolutely

432
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,680
one for corporate leaders and

433
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,360
entrepreneurial leaders. And we have to

434
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,839
think about our sources of talent and

435
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,079
the location of those ideas. the capital

436
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,480
where we get that from manufacturing

437
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,360
choices, supply chains, customer base.

438
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,760
And so really in a sense our entire

439
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
strategic approach is going to have to

440
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,839
be sort of read through this rather

441
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
different and distinctive calculus. And

442
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,199
this is something that I think

443
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,279
simultaneously is a new and important

444
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,279
challenge. It's something that the

445
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,199
universities themselves, MIT included,

446
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,920
have to think about very very deeply as

447
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,560
we continue to build and support our

448
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,320
institution as a global institution. But

449
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,320
also we want to help organizations like

450
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,639
yours I think in really understanding

451
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,519
this and be part of that journey uh that

452
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,000
you're going on to really sort of shape

453
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,279
you know this intersection between

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,959
corporate innovation and geopolitics.

455
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,720
So I think having that calculus in the

456
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,000
boardroom matters today more than ever

457
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
frankly because I think these

458
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
geopolitical dynamics are here to stay.

459
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
They are dynamics and they are changing

460
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,800
at a pace that I think is is almost

461
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,320
unprecedented and that means that

462
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,320
decisions around innovation,

463
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,079
industrialization, investment, you know,

464
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,639
all being made in this ever changing

465
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,320
context and so we have to really sort of

466
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
understand that I think and I hope that

467
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,480
we can be part of supporting your

468
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,320
discussions and your debates uh in those

469
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,920
activities.

470
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,079
And so with that, thank you. I'm going

471
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,600
to stop sharing.

472
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,920
Thank you so much Fiona. Um

473
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,480
>> a big topic for a short amount of time.

474
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,720
So I hope that um I managed to get in

475
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,759
enough but not too much for everybody.

476
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
Thank you everyone.

477
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
>> Well, we're not finished with you. So so

478
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,040
so stay around. Um but yes, it's always

479
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,880
fascinating to hear what you have to say

480
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
and and these days it's become so much

481
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,600
more complex and and that you're across

482
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,000
that is is wonderful. You know, I

483
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
reflect every morning as I read the

484
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,039
headlines. you mentioned the New York

485
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,120
Times um about how much and how rapidly

486
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,600
the world is changing again. I was

487
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,600
finishing my doctorate in aeronautics

488
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,319
and astronautics as the cold war was

489
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,839
ending. So that was the last big shift.

490
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,640
And I remember thinking then that the

491
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,839
road ahead was sunny as far as one could

492
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,280
see. And it it just if if you need a

493
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,480
reminder of just how complex the world

494
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,400
remains, stubbornly complex, we just

495
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
need to hear what you just had to say.
