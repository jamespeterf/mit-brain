1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
No, thank you very much. I have the the

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,519
pleasure of introducing a a section

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,680
here, a session that will focus on

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,400
sustainability across two somewhat

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,480
disperate uh industries, telecom and

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,600
aviation. But I think you'll find over

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
the course of the session that they

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,160
intersect uh quite nicely and we'll be

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,920
able to leverage some of uh the lessons

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,160
we learned from this. Uh so the next

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,520
speaker will be professor Masha Fox.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,399
She's an assistant professor of

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,079
aereroastro. She is a true scholar

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
practitioner who spent several years

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,399
prior to this at Rolls-Royce. Masha,

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,399
thank you.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
>> All right. Thank you very much for

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
having me. Um so I'm an assistant

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,320
professor at MIT. I work in the gas

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,320
turbine lab in the lab for aviation

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,559
environment and my passion is

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,719
sustainability and sustainability in

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
aviation. Now, at my core, I'm a

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
fluidamicist and a and a

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,079
thermodynamicist. And I've but I'm

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
really interested in connecting the

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
science question to the engineering

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,880
question that can make a difference in

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,439
our world. And so, that's what I wanted

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,439
to talk to you about today. Uh,

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,840
sustainability in aviation is really

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,479
difficult and the challenges that it

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
poses go beyond any single individual

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,320
contribution. That's actually why I'm

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,240
really excited to be here today. It's to

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
to sort of talk about the need for

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,560
collaboration. collaboration that that

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,479
we've heard about this morning between

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,280
uh entrepreneurs, government driving

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,520
policy uh investment and the science and

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,360
the engineering technologies uh behind

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,040
that that that really requires uh all of

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,400
us coming together to solve the

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,640
challenges. And the second is you know

45
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,880
sustainable aviation uh is is not

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,240
impervious to the laws of physics. uh

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,920
lest we are seen to be greenwashing, we

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,759
need to be very rigorous in how we

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,320
account for the technology that we

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,640
invest in. So we need to understand the

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,119
physics, the science so that we know

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,360
what are the levers, how do we invest

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,360
and how do we communicate what we're

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
doing in the world of sustainability to

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
take people the community along that

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
journey with us. So when I teach

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
thermodynamics and propulsion at MIT, I

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,920
begin with the range equation, the

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,640
airplane range equation. And it relates

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,080
how far an airplane can go uh with with

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,319
a few other parameters. For example, um

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
what kind of a fuel is it carrying and

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,560
the energy content of that fuel, how

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,879
efficient that uh propulsor is at

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,519
converting the energy stored in that

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,239
chemistry of the fuel to propulsive

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
thrust. That's the efficiency term.

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,760
something about the aircraft

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,560
aerodynamics. So that's the lift to drag

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,879
ratio uh and how much fuel has been

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,599
burnt. So the log of the the weight of

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
the initial aircraft uh divided by the

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,680
final weight of the aircraft. So

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,200
assuming conservation of passengers, the

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
only thing that changed has been the

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,879
fuel that we burned.

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,920
So let me set the stage for aviation. In

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,400
the past, uh, emissions of CO2, which

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,879
are the direct byproduct of combusting

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,080
fuel, of releasing that heat energy,

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,159
have been relatively constant.

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,000
Uh, the CO2 emission is about 2.5% of

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,720
global emissions. Now, why have they

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,959
been constant? In general, every year

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,200
the fleet improves in efficiency. Older

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,200
airplanes are retired, new airplanes

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
come in. So, why isn't this curve going

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280
down? Well, at the same time there's a

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
growth in aviation

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
uh and the two have historically offset

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,599
each other so that emissions from

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,840
aviation have remained pretty constant

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,200
and today they're at about 2 and a half%

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,680
of global CO2 contribution. Now that's

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,319
important because CO2 has radiative

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
warming impact on our climate. Um as the

97
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,799
earth reflects energy in the atmosphere

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
CO2 in the atmosphere uh captures that

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,959
and sends it back to the earth. of

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,360
warming the planet and that's measured

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,840
by effective radiating force. So we know

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,599
CO2 in the atmosphere uh which is the

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,239
direct result of combustion of that

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,400
those hydrocarbon fuels uh contributes

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
to radiative forcing. But that's not the

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,720
only thing going on in an airplane.

107
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,879
There's also emissions of NOx which have

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,440
a contribution to global warming and

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
contrails. So contrails uh sort of act

110
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,519
as a blanket again when the earth wants

111
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,720
to cool off. uh the presence of

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,400
contrails sometimes um doesn't allow

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
that cooling off to happen. So so

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
warming up the environment. Now there's

115
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
a lot of uncertainty and different time

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
scales associated with this global

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,360
warming. But by and large these are the

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,680
three major impacts of aviation on

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,560
global warming.

120
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,199
Today if we account for contrails NOx

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,360
and CO2 the impact of aviation is

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,479
between 3 and a half and 6% of the

123
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,240
overall global warming. But we're at a

124
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,560
precipice

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,479
tomorrow. The growth of aviation is

126
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
going to take off in a way that we

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
haven't seen it before. And this is a

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,320
good thing, right? It's going to

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
encourage uh globalization. It's going

130
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,800
to give more people opportunities to

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,840
travel, to connect. And that's very

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,120
important. But at the same time, um the

133
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,120
the sort of efficiency gains that we've

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,080
had historically are going to be

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,560
outpaced by the demand for aviation. By

136
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,880
2050, the CO2 emissions from aviation

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,800
are going to more than double. Uh and

138
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,320
that goes for contrails and and NOx

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,880
effects as well. So uh so growth of

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,280
aviation is going to continue to grow.

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,840
So why can't we just decarbonize? All of

142
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,919
the other sectors that are emitting CO2

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,400
and and global warming effects will

144
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,000
begin to decarbonize. Why is aviation so

145
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,880
difficult to decarbonize? Why can't we

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,919
just electrify it away? Let's go back to

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,120
that range equation. Turns out the most

148
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,039
emissions from aviation occur on long

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,280
range flights.

150
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,840
So that's important because batteries

151
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,400
for example can only displace a very

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,479
short amount short duration flights

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,520
short range.

154
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,919
If we look at the the range equation for

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,400
an electric propulser the equation

156
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,840
changes slightly. First of all there's

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,520
no longer a log with with the weight. So

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,600
even as we're using power from the

159
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,360
battery, the battery weight does not

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,160
change. Uh and the the specific density

161
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,440
so so the energy per kilogram of a

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,560
battery is about 50 times lower than

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,600
that of a hydrocarbon fuel. So the range

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,199
for a battery powered aircraft is very

165
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,560
short. So even if we electrified as best

166
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,199
as we could, we would only displace 5%

167
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,639
of aviation emissions. We might think

168
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,880
about electrifying using other

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
technologies such as fuel cells and

170
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,720
they're a little bit better at that

171
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,600
energy density problem, but still

172
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,880
they're limited in range. Really 2,000

173
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,199
maybe if you're really pushing the

174
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,400
boundary 4,000

175
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,680
uh uh kilometers in in range. That

176
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,400
accounts for 20 to 40% of aviation

177
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,479
emissions. So where do we need to focus

178
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,960
our research on? Well, the bulk of

179
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,120
aviation emissions are going to continue

180
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,919
to come from gas turbine engines

181
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,440
converting energy which is stored in a

182
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,400
fuel into heat which creates useful work

183
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
in a braen cycle which is a gas turbine.

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
So if we think about making the most

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
amount of impact that's the technology

186
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,720
we really need to think about. Now the

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
other challenge in aviation is that

188
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,919
airplanes have a very long time scale.

189
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,520
Airplane lifespan is about 25 years.

190
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,599
That means the airplanes that are coming

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,199
off the production lines today will

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,120
continue emitting the same exact

193
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,520
emissions in 2050. So understanding the

194
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,080
time constant in in the aviation

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,039
industry is also really important in in

196
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,520
thinking about making a difference. So

197
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,759
it's important to think about aviation

198
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,039
both in the near term and in the future

199
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,639
term. So improving how we fly today and

200
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,720
thinking about designing better

201
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,840
solutions for the future. And that's

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
what I wanted to talk to you about

203
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
today. So sort of some of the research

204
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,520
MIT is doing in both fronts and how

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,039
that's going to be able to make a

206
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
difference.

207
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,840
Um so so let me begin with the the today

208
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,160
factor.

209
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,759
The first thing we need to do is improve

210
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,919
how efficiently we fly. In general

211
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,120
there's about a 7 and a half%

212
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,840
inefficiency in managing airplanes. Now

213
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,839
an airplane uh to fly efficiently it can

214
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,839
take advantage of the winds. there's an

215
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,719
optimal altitude and speed which

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,200
airplanes should be flying but sometimes

217
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,440
they're not able to. Sometimes it's

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,480
geopolitical reasons, right? We might be

219
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,880
avoiding regions of no flight. Um we see

220
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,519
a lot of inefficiency there. Sometimes

221
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,399
it's due to weather and other times it's

222
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,920
just due to um policy. So so airline

223
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,480
policy, we might want to get from point

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,959
A to point B faster and that costs us

225
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,000
more fuel. So in aggregate that's about

226
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,399
7 and a half% in efficiency uh in

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
aviation today is just due to operation.

228
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,480
Now the interesting thing is this

229
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,720
doesn't require a technology change to

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,720
fix this. The technology is already on

231
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,080
board all the airplanes. It's it exists

232
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,760
in satellites. Uh this requires a policy

233
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,519
and and a global buyin uh to to actually

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,080
make this change. So again sort of

235
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,440
explaining how challenges in sustainable

236
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,000
aviation are more than just one

237
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,880
technological solution.

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Part of the efficiency story is also

239
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,880
maintaining the fleet. So the fleet has

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,279
a lifespan of 25 years and we can't just

241
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,920
ignore that. So it's really important to

242
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,160
think about either accelerating the the

243
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,959
turnover of the fleet if there are

244
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,399
airplanes available to replace them or

245
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:57,279
modifying existing engines to inject new

246
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,279
technology as there throughout their

247
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,440
lifespan. So a continuous improvement in

248
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,160
a way. Uh we know a lot more about the

249
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
physics of of inside the the heat engine

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
than we did 25 years ago when some of

251
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
these airplanes were first developed.

252
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,959
why not inject that now as these

253
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,440
airplanes are are uh serving the world.

254
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,040
Um and that just that sort of drives a

255
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,560
different business model that that

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,720
hasn't really existed before.

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,560
The other important aspect of what we

258
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,440
should be doing today is around

259
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,040
sustainable aviation fuels. Now, where

260
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,360
in my range equation does sustainable

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,480
aviation fuel come in? Any takers?

262
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,240
It doesn't. It actually doesn't improve

263
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,839
anything in that range equation. But

264
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,680
what it does is it uh changes where the

265
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,320
carbon that's released into the

266
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,079
atmosphere comes from today. It comes

267
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
from the ground. So we dig up fossil

268
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,519
fuels, we combust that energy and new

269
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,360
carbon goes into the atmosphere in the

270
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,839
future. And what sustainable aviation

271
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
fuel allows us to do is to capture that

272
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,200
carbon either from the atmosphere uh

273
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,760
directly or through uh bios through

274
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,079
plants photosynthesis convert that into

275
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,079
fuel and combust that fuel and release

276
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:14,240
it back in a net zero way. Now it's

277
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,240
really important to track the entire

278
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,440
life cycle of sustainable aviation

279
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,680
fuels. um for some processes that's

280
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
actually very carbon intensive and

281
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,200
sometimes even worse than just using

282
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,120
traditional jet fuel. So we have to be

283
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,480
very rigorous in accounting for the life

284
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,640
cycle of sustainable aviation fuels.

285
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,200
And the other thing is putting together

286
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,360
hydrogens and carbons in a lab to make

287
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,560
this hydrocarbon sustainable aviation

288
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,320
fuel. Well, it requires energy and

289
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,720
energy costs money. So scaling up the

290
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,360
production of sustainable aviation fuel

291
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,800
to meet the demands that we will see is

292
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,800
going to require uh a a cost premium and

293
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,279
that cost premium is not going to go

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,079
away. So we can think about uh

295
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,640
technological challenges to improve that

296
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,519
uh synthetic manufacturing process but

297
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,320
we also need help from policy and from

298
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,920
markets to incentivize the development

299
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,200
of the sustainable aviation fuel

300
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,440
economy. Now, saps are beyond just

301
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
carbon. What most people don't realize

302
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,240
is they're expensive, but they can

303
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,959
actually be very clean. The chemical

304
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,279
composition of of when you put hydrogen

305
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,279
and carbon in a lab together is very

306
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,279
different than sort of the cocktail of

307
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,639
molecules you dig up from the ground in

308
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,399
fossil fuel. When you dig up the the the

309
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,639
mixture, uh there's a really key

310
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,600
component called aromatics. It's it's a

311
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,200
circular hydrocarbon and when combusted

312
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,600
it creates this black smoke soot that's

313
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,040
actually very bad for human health and

314
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,079
can affect uh communities near airports

315
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,320
London. Uh sustainable aviation fuel on

316
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,720
the other hand uh does not have that

317
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,800
compound if if we decide not to make it.

318
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,040
We can make a purely paraffhinic

319
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,480
synthetic aviation fuel which when

320
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,120
combusted lacks that that uh soot and

321
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,399
lacks the the health implications. This

322
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,279
might also have implications for

323
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,519
contrails. So so we need to be bold in

324
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,079
taking advantage of this ability to

325
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,200
synthesize hydrocarbons that in a way

326
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,519
that's not just easy to implement but

327
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,839
that's the right way to to do it. And we

328
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
need to be ready to fund the cost

329
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,880
premium that's going to be associated

330
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
with it.

331
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,959
But those are all technologies that

332
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,040
exist today. What are we thinking about

333
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,040
in the future?

334
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,399
Here is a comparison of airplane

335
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,720
silhouettes for the past 60 years. Tuban

336
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,440
wing has looked like tuban wing for

337
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,760
since 1960. Is that how they will always

338
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,040
look? Well, actually no. Aircrafts of

339
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,360
the future might look something like

340
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,920
this. This is a a concept called

341
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
boundary layer ingestion. boundary layer

342
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,360
is a boundary layer is a low momentum

343
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,440
fluid that occurs near surfaces. So on

344
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,600
the body of this aircraft, the low

345
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,600
momentum fluid is actually being

346
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,399
ingested intentionally by the

347
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,959
propulsors. Now by accelerating low

348
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:15,680
momentum fluid um it it not only reduces

349
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,920
the overall sort of drag and force

350
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,600
required to propel that airplane but it

351
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,760
improves the propulsive efficiency of

352
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,160
these engines.

353
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,639
It might look something like this. The

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,399
concept here uh proposed by Electra is

355
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
distributed electric propulsion. So

356
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,279
instead of two propulsers on on the

357
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,680
wings, we see 10 propulsors, 10 small

358
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,839
little electrically driven propulsors.

359
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,959
Now the ability here is each one of

360
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,959
those propulsers can blow on the wing

361
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,600
increasing its lift. It's it's a concept

362
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,320
called blown lift in fluid dynamics.

363
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,880
That increases the L over D in our range

364
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,639
equation. So, all of these technologies

365
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,800
are addressing the different factors of

366
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,480
the range equation. Um, and if we keep

367
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,040
range the same, we can use less fuel.

368
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
Core to all of this technology is this

369
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,639
idea of hybrid electric. But wait a

370
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,079
minute, you told me electric airplanes

371
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,760
aren't going to take off. Well, that's

372
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,959
true. That's true. If we're only talking

373
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,279
about batteries, hybrid electric is when

374
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,279
we have some sort of a fuel on board,

375
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,079
but instead of using that fuel to

376
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,399
directly propel the aircraft, we're

377
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,240
using it to generate electricity. And

378
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,639
then we're using that electricity to

379
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,199
drive some sort of a new airplane

380
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,279
propulsor configuration like a boundary

381
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,600
layer ingesting fan or distributed

382
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,880
electric propulsors.

383
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,639
So the the intersection of how these gas

384
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,600
turbine engines which are powering

385
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,959
generators is really important to

386
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,720
understanding what the overall

387
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,639
architecture looks like because they're

388
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,560
the ones that are actually burning fuel.

389
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,800
Uh but the propulsors are the ones

390
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,040
creating thrust. So decoupling the fuel

391
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,600
burn from the propulsors and integrating

392
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,839
them with an aircraft uh is is going to

393
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,360
be the forefront of of future airplane

394
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,160
technology.

395
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,160
What about other fuels? We might have

396
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,639
heard about hydrogen. Let's unpack

397
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,120
hydrogen using our range equation. Well,

398
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,360
hydrogen is great because it carries a

399
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,320
lot more energy. In fact, it has three

400
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,519
times more energy per per kilogram than

401
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,920
uh jet fuel. So, that's great, but it's

402
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,199
a gas. So, so it takes up a lot of

403
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,560
volume. We might compress it to to take

404
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,120
up less volume. Uh we might liquefy it

405
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,360
so so that it takes up even less volume.

406
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,800
But even in the mo most optimistic

407
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,680
scenarios where we've cooled um the

408
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,079
hydrogen, it still takes up about four

409
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,440
times more volume which has to be

410
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,680
carried in very large tanks. So the site

411
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,279
the the promise is there but the

412
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,920
technology that's needed is this

413
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,480
integration of being able to carry that

414
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,199
hydrogen in in an aircraft and making

415
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,920
sure that the entire CA uh system

416
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,720
closes.

417
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,320
So, six things. These are the six topics

418
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,800
that people are talking about in

419
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,959
sustainable aviation. Now, if I didn't

420
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,880
talk about the the midterm, the new

421
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,919
airplanes that are going to come out in

422
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,799
2030s, 2040s, the new engines, those are

423
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,400
important, too, but I'm really

424
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,959
interested in straddling the little

425
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,959
eyes. That's what we do today. And the

426
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,280
big eyes, and that that's what we do in

427
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,839
the future. And and that's where I think

428
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,919
a lot of the research is is happening.

429
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,439
But none of that research can happen in

430
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,080
isolation.

431
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,000
It requires collaboration, discussion,

432
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,360
incentivization,

433
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,200
um, and and really interesting

434
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
strategies to go from fundamental

435
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
science, the fluid dynamics that I'm

436
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,440
really interested in and exploring in my

437
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,919
lab to the engineering solution, uh,

438
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,919
which is these airplanes that we see as

439
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,400
safe and critical, uh, to to policy. So

440
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,880
something that the, uh, the community

441
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
buys into and and believes in. That's

442
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,320
why I'm really excited to talk with you

443
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,280
all today and I'd welcome any questions

444
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,039
about this. Uh I'm going to turn it over

445
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,600
to Sar who's going to talk about the

446
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:08,200
sustainability of digitization

447
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,200
uh and and that aspect of it.

448
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,120
>> Thank you. What I would like to say is

449
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
if you have questions for Masha, please

450
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
use pigeon hole. But keep in mind that

451
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
we will have a chance to ask Sarwalk

452
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,799
questions as well. But then more

453
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
importantly, we'll have a chance to ask

454
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,799
them both questions for a bit of

455
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
dialogue. And if you remember nothing

456
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,120
else from today, sorry presenters, but I

457
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,600
would like to say having done this now

458
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,400
facilitation between corporations and

459
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,640
faculty members, the one bit of advice

460
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,160
is the discourse is what matters. So

461
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,840
think right now what will I remember in

462
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,080
five years. Sorry Masha it won't be the

463
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,520
formula but it'll be the discourse you

464
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,000
have between each other and perhaps what

465
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,760
they have between each other. Sawir um

466
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,840
we're blessed right now to have saw who

467
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,919
has worked in a large corporation who's

468
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,160
worked in small startup corporations and

469
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,080
more importantly I believe gives back to

470
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
the smaller corporations in which BT is

471
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,960
working. So the director of

472
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,480
sustainability for BT group Sarah Khan.

473
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,039
>> Thank you so much Steve.

474
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,120
Welcome to BT first of all. Hopefully

475
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,600
you're having a a great day and the team

476
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,000
are looking after you. So um I'm Saw

477
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,160
Khan. My background very much has been

478
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,640
uh more than a decade in the energy

479
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,559
industry, five years, six years in fact

480
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,000
in the telecoms industry and I've also

481
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,840
got a background in AI. So um following

482
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
on from Masha, you might be thinking

483
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,600
about what's the similarity between the

484
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,600
telecoms industry and uh the aviation

485
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,120
industry. Well, the the fascinating

486
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,760
thing actually is uh both industries are

487
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,240
experiencing an increase in demand for

488
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,919
consumption. In the case of the aviation

489
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
side, it's obviously passenger flights

490
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,039
and and uh wanting to travel the world.

491
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,200
In our case, it's the thirst for data.

492
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,760
Um and you've probably heard and maybe

493
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,400
you can't get away from it. Um there's a

494
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,520
big word at the moment which is AI. Um

495
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,480
and in the context of digitalization,

496
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,600
that's where the demand for um or the

497
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,520
thirst for data comes from.

498
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,960
Um first of all, I'd like to start off

499
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,039
by saying it's really important to call

500
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,679
out that actually digitalization and AI

501
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,160
can be a force for good and will be a a

502
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,200
force for good. And we've already seen

503
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,760
some real life examples across industry

504
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,039
where organizations are already driving

505
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,799
increases in productivity, increases in

506
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,240
efficiency and reducing waste. So um I

507
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,799
just wanted to call out a couple of my

508
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,520
personal uh favorite examples actually.

509
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,960
So uh when we think about smart energy

510
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,960
and I know Masha talked a little bit

511
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,600
around the the demand for energy in the

512
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,760
aviation sector. We have the UK power

513
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,799
networks uh which is effectively a

514
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,760
distribution company uh in in the UK.

515
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,080
They're utilizing machine learning to

516
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,520
scan rooftops and they're doing that

517
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,240
because they want to identify

518
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,799
opportunities to deploy more solar. So

519
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,039
accelerating the transition to net zero

520
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,159
for the UK, but also they're using the

521
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,799
same technology to uh identify something

522
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,280
referred to as invisible energy and that

523
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,840
is people who've already installed solar

524
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,840
panels on their rooftop but the uh

525
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,840
energy consumption is sat behind a smart

526
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,159
meter and that data is not filtering

527
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,760
through to uh the grid and the UK are

528
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,480
not able to report on it. So they

529
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,200
already utilizing AI as a way of solving

530
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,480
both problems. The other one, which is a

531
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
personal favorite, and that's only

532
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,240
because my wife is constantly on my case

533
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,120
for uh putting uh putting the the wrong

534
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,520
item in the recycling box, um is a

535
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,559
company called Litter Lotto. So, um

536
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,720
Litter Lotto have a an application where

537
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,960
anyone can upload images of their

538
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,120
rubbish. Really interesting in in from

539
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
the starting point. Um and they will

540
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,679
give you some guidance as to where to

541
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,919
place your litter. And the the ambition

542
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,360
there is to try and uh encourage

543
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,600
individuals to increase their recycling.

544
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,919
Uh but also it has a knock-on benefit

545
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,240
for local authorities where they're able

546
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,200
to reduce the cost of recycling um

547
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,520
because there's there's a it costs a lot

548
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,880
more to be able to sort out at the

549
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,120
recycling facility items into the right

550
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
um facilities and and so on. So really

551
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,480
great initiative and little Lotto

552
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,320
encourage individuals to do that by

553
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,559
entering them into a monthly draw where

554
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,919
they can win a prize. So there's also a

555
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,039
local uh benefit um to to that as well.

556
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,000
So um absolutely we believe AI can be a

557
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,000
force for good. Uh but it's it's

558
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,559
important to call out that it also comes

559
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,799
at an environmental cost. So there are

560
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,120
some trade-offs to think about and I

561
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,720
think this graph uh shows that really

562
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,080
nicely. Um and it's from a recent uh

563
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,480
piece of work uh under the AI index 2025

564
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,960
which shows uh the carbon emissions

565
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,240
associated with training some of the

566
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,200
larger language models. So uh chat GPT

567
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,880
or GPT for the specific uh open source

568
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,120
model is there and you can see there's

569
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,679
been an exponential increase over the

570
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,559
last couple of years um very much

571
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,880
associated with the growth of large

572
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,200
language models and you can see Llama

573
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,559
3.1 there really taking off in terms of

574
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,799
carbon emissions. Um so what is that

575
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,480
associated with and and what's changed

576
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,440
in the last two years when it comes to

577
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,400
AI is predominantly the way AI has

578
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,200
advanced to uh deep learning models deep

579
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
learning neural network type models and

580
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,400
these models are super complex. In fact

581
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,440
they they're built to imitate the brain.

582
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,200
So they're built on many many layers and

583
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,039
it's very difficult to enter the layers

584
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,679
and understand what's happening there.

585
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,080
But as you feed more data into an AI

586
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,520
model, um the layers just continue to

587
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,400
expand. Um the second thing is these

588
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,520
this new generation of AI models, they

589
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,400
tend to utilize unstructured data sets

590
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,360
and that's where a lot of compute power

591
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,440
actually is is consumed. It's it's

592
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,760
processing unstructured data. So what is

593
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
unstructured data? without being going

594
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
too much into the detail that's

595
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,440
effectively where the data is not

596
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,159
labeled prior to it entering the AI

597
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,760
model and therefore the AI model has to

598
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,520
uh you know compute what that data set

599
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,480
actually looks like what it is etc and

600
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,520
assign a label. Um, additionally the AI

601
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,520
model has to continuously iterate itself

602
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,600
to ensure that the output from the AI

603
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,559
model and the recommendation it provides

604
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,840
is accurate and there is an accuracy

605
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,840
trade-off as well when it comes to

606
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,120
sustainability because the more you

607
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,919
iterate um the more compute power again

608
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,760
that it consumes and then very finally

609
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,760
um if we think about AI we're not just

610
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,159
thinking about the chipset that it

611
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,440
resides on um it actually has we have to

612
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
think holistically about the

613
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,320
infrastructure that sits that's behind

614
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,400
it. So typically compute will go into

615
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,159
a a server which may reside in a data

616
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,480
center and if you take into account the

617
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,960
full life cycle impact and the energy

618
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,360
associated with it that's where the the

619
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,080
big concerns are.

620
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,039
So if we think about specifically what

621
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,919
is the impact if we take these models

622
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,840
and bring them into the UK where large

623
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,360
language opensource models become the

624
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:31,039
basis for industries and public sector

625
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,880
deploying AI models um at scale. Well

626
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,400
there's there's a potential energy

627
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,279
challenge even before we enter the

628
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,080
sustainability uh uh domain within the

629
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,320
UK. So uh the government this year

630
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,400
launched something called the UK AI

631
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,640
opportunities action plan and

632
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,600
underpinning that is a promise that

633
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,279
there'll be a 20fold increase in compute

634
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,320
capability within the UK enabling the UK

635
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,440
to be an AI superpower.

636
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,720
Um so in terms of what it means from an

637
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,320
energy perspective you can see in 2024

638
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,360
the total demand in the country was

639
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:12,960
approximately 319 terowatt hours. um 285

640
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,799
terowatt hours UK generated domestically

641
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,480
but quite a large proportion of that is

642
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,520
coming through the interconnect. So the

643
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,000
UK is effectively importing electricity

644
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,919
from our neighbors France, Belgium to

645
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,960
cover the deficit in terms of the

646
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,520
electricity consumption today. Now if we

647
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,919
take the ambition by the UK government

648
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,400
to have a 20fold increase in compute

649
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,679
power in the UK then roughly that goes

650
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,200
from 3.6 6 terowatt hours today to

651
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,440
approximately 72 terowatt hours by 2030.

652
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,360
So pretty significant increase in

653
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,880
digital demand and that is to fuel the

654
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,799
data centers that will enter this

655
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,480
country. Um if we then combine that with

656
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,960
the energy outlook provided by um Nesso

657
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,200
for 2030 and that is part of the UK

658
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,039
government's plan to decarbonize at the

659
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:07,120
same time. So um achieving 95% clean

660
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:11,360
power in the UK by 2030. You can see

661
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,120
pretty much in this space that um we get

662
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,279
pretty much there in terms of fulfilling

663
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,520
the demand. But actually there's around

664
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,240
50 terowatt hours that's accounted for

665
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,760
and that's because the Nesso plan

666
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,200
accounted for a five-fold increase in

667
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,799
terms of electricity consumption

668
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,760
specifically from data centers. So

669
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,600
there's a significant gap left there.

670
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,520
So why does that leave a challenge?

671
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,520
Well, um the first thing is there's 50

672
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,080
terowatt hours potentially unaccounted

673
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,440
for. So there's an energy security uh uh

674
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,400
issue straight away there. But that's

675
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,760
potentially over we can overcome that.

676
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,360
Um but there's some serious

677
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,279
considerations that need to be taken

678
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,679
into account by the the government and

679
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,840
and industry as a whole. So what are the

680
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,880
options available to do that? Well, the

681
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,279
first one is the country increases the

682
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,760
interconnects and continues to take more

683
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,279
from the neighbors such as Belgium and

684
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,600
France. But obviously the big

685
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,880
consideration here is in terms of uh

686
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:13,200
energy security. The second one is uh

687
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,120
could we retain gas for longer? Um the

688
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,120
the consideration on the back side of

689
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,200
that is actually that pushes out our net

690
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,720
zero ambition as you can see from the

691
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,440
the gap there. Um third one is to

692
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,279
increase dispatchable power. Um so that

693
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,880
could be maybe combining gas with carbon

694
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,760
capture and storage and having it um sat

695
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,760
available. So if the wind didn't blow as

696
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
hard as it should or the sun didn't

697
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,399
shine as much as it should, then you

698
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,720
call upon the dispatchable power unit to

699
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,880
turn on and provide the the power to to

700
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,880
cover that. that comes at an increased

701
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,120
cost because you've essentially got

702
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,520
power capability sat redundant for most

703
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,919
of the time. And then the fourth option

704
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,200
which is to increase uh the percentage

705
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,960
of offshore wind in the UK but obviously

706
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,399
uh building an offshore wind farm

707
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,039
doesn't happen overnight. There are some

708
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,120
long lead times associated with it. So

709
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,440
um some smart decisions have to be made

710
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,640
now in terms of heading down that route.

711
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,919
So the UK has a challenge today in terms

712
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:19,440
of fulfilling the ambition to be an AI

713
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:24,679
superpower and also being net zero in

714
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,679
terms of our energy supply by 2030.

715
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,159
However, this is where there's an

716
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,320
opportunity because as we see demand for

717
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
AI grow, I come back to my first point

718
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,240
where AI can be a force for good and

719
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,559
we'll see it in terms of increasing

720
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,799
productivity and so on. then naturally

721
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,720
this is an opportunity for the UK to

722
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,080
also double down on the green growth

723
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,919
agenda to back and fuel the growth of

724
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,559
AI. So um in terms of making the right

725
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,720
decision uh there's a potential

726
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,440
opportunity arising here where we see

727
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,360
the 50 terowatt uh hour gap in energy

728
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,080
demand being filled through a

729
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,799
combination of both offshore wind in the

730
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,200
UK and a smarter grid and the benefits

731
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,000
associated with that is an increase in

732
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,640
green skills so more technicians more

733
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,880
skilled engineers um coupled with that

734
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,080
we'll also see the emergence of storage

735
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,279
technology so CC CS, battery, uh

736
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,600
whatever it is, we'll we'll see um that

737
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,200
potentially emerge. And then finally, uh

738
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,360
the big aspect here, which is about

739
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,279
energy resilience and a secure energy

740
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,240
system.

741
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,039
On the other side, um there's a bit of a

742
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,120
dependency here in terms of AI itself

743
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,600
becoming efficient. Otherwise, there's

744
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,720
the risk where we'll continue to see AI

745
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,240
grow, put more energy strain, and you

746
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,240
know, there's a limit in terms of how

747
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,120
many offshore wind farms we can spin up

748
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,440
in a set time. So, um we need to see

749
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,279
some innovations happening on the AI

750
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,600
side and we're we are starting to see

751
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,440
that on on the fringes, but what are the

752
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,960
big topics that are under research at

753
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,600
the moment? Well, the first one is

754
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,159
something called zeroot or federated

755
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,880
learning. So this is the ability where

756
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,960
an AI model effectively doesn't have to

757
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,480
iterate or reiterate as much to

758
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,640
understand the context and give an

759
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,960
output. Um it's smart enough from prompt

760
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,120
engineering to make an informed decision

761
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,200
to provide an output. So reducing

762
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,559
iteration obviously reduces compute

763
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,799
power. So that's something being looked

764
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,480
into. The second thing is um

765
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,840
quantization and distillation

766
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,640
techniques. So this is um removing the

767
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,720
fat essentially. So data going in just

768
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,640
making sure it's the right data and

769
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,760
therefore the compute capability only

770
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,679
has to process exactly what it needs. So

771
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,640
again reduces compute power. Um

772
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,279
neuromorphic computing. So this is a

773
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,080
really interesting area still very much

774
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,240
under heavy research under academia.

775
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,480
This is the ability to combine compute

776
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,679
and storage together. Um obviously from

777
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,840
a e-waste perspective that's great but

778
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,600
uh overall in terms of power consumption

779
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,679
you can drive some synergies because you

780
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,159
remove something called a digital clock.

781
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,799
And then very finally really interesting

782
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,039
look from big tech companies but also uh

783
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,000
corporations is dynamic AI load

784
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,960
management. So this is where you match

785
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,200
um your workloads for AI with

786
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,120
availability of green energy and you try

787
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,360
to do that on an hourly basis. So we're

788
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,360
starting to see that emerge. Some tech

789
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,559
providers starting to provide solutions

790
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,600
and software that enables companies to

791
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,720
um program and schedule their workloads

792
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,480
to match. But that's all great, but

793
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,279
there is a dependency on a few things.

794
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,960
So the first one is um if we are to have

795
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,679
green growth and we're about to have it

796
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,000
in terms of being ready for 2030 where

797
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,279
we're going to expect the AI boom then

798
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,039
we have to back something called um uh

799
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,880
contracts for difference and this is

800
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,600
basically the government's way of

801
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,399
procuring renewable energy and it sends

802
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,720
a price signal to organizations. It

803
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,320
gives them the reassurance for a fixed

804
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,919
term that this is the price the

805
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
government will pay for a certain type

806
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,760
of technology. And um to get to that 20

807
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,640
target, the uh the auction that's due to

808
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,120
happen uh early next year has got to be

809
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,120
the biggest auction for offshore wind in

810
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,760
the history of this country. So we're

811
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,919
waiting to see what happens. um a lot of

812
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,720
um discussions being had around that and

813
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,559
a lot of advocacy going into helping the

814
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,159
government understand you know what's

815
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,840
the right strike price that they need to

816
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,399
set to make sure that they are able to

817
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,399
do that. Um I would say although it's a

818
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,360
huge ambition the government have

819
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,440
successfully managed to um drive

820
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,519
adoption of offshore wind over the last

821
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,519
couple of years by altering the strike

822
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,360
price under the contract for difference.

823
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,200
So it is possible so that level of

824
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,760
ambition should remain. The other thing

825
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,320
is uh investment into building a smarter

826
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,000
grid. So whilst we uplift our energy

827
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,519
system and we bring more renewables,

828
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,679
more electric vehicles etc onto the

829
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,320
grid, without a smarter grid, you have

830
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,080
some flexibility uh challenges and um

831
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,320
you still got copper there in terms of

832
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,120
the distribution network. So you know

833
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,519
being able to do things like um dual

834
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,679
management, flexibility, demand side

835
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,839
response, etc. does require an

836
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,159
investment into a smarter grid. And then

837
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,159
very finally as Masha uh called out and

838
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,720
maybe you've heard it already throughout

839
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,879
the day, increased collaboration between

840
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,480
academia, energy and the tech sector.

841
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,560
And you can pretty much see why, right?

842
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,240
Because on one hand you've got AI

843
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,839
growth, on the other hand, you've got an

844
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,599
energy dilemma, you've got a

845
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,320
sustainability challenge, and then

846
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,480
you've got uh innovation challenges in

847
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,440
terms of early research within AI

848
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,280
itself. So um lots of opportunity to to

849
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,839
collaborate and drive this agenda for

850
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,000
good. So again getting back to that

851
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,399
point of reducing waste, increasing

852
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,320
productivity but doing it powered by

853
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,879
green growth.

854
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,879
Thank you very much.

855
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:06,640
Oh no, that's mine. You mine.

856
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,160
Thank you SA. Um so if we can put any

857
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,160
pigeon hole questions on the screen, I

858
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,480
would appreciate it. I'll sort of start

859
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,440
by saying Chancellor Nobles um indicated

860
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,599
earlier that part of MIT student success

861
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
is due in part through collaboration and

862
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,800
I think you heard both speakers say that

863
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,200
just now. Um in order to get to a

864
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,560
technological question, may I ask uh to

865
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,800
start this off, what is one of the

866
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,960
biggest misconceptions

867
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,359
to your path to net zero in your

868
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,359
respective industries?

869
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,720
>> Would you like me to go first?

870
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,839
>> Yeah.

871
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,119
Great question. Very challenging. I I

872
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,760
think I'll go back to the earlier point

873
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,119
I made around consumption. So there is

874
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,040
the uh misconception that we can't

875
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,800
decouple growth, right? That's the

876
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,320
starting point for for a lot of people

877
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,200
particularly within the the telco

878
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,359
sector. Um but we are starting to see

879
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,599
some early shoots and and and and green

880
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,960
shoots and that is backed by things like

881
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,320
renewable energy starting to to grow

882
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,400
across Europe and and and the UK. So we

883
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,760
we do believe that you can decouple

884
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,680
growth. So what by the way what does

885
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,560
decoupling growth mean? It means you can

886
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,040
you can continue to consume more but at

887
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,800
the same time the um the carbon

888
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,079
footprint associated with that goes

889
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,160
down. Um so uh that's usually the

890
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,480
starting point but we do believe that

891
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,560
you can decouple both and and and

892
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,160
achieve both at the same time.

893
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,079
>> Do you find it challenging in that the

894
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,240
growth seems to be in different

895
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,480
directions as well? It's a very dynamic

896
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,400
area that you live in, whether it's the

897
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,880
grid, it's computing at the edge. Is it

898
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,280
hard to focus on an area while everybody

899
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,599
else is growing in a spiderweb?

900
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,800
>> Yeah, it's it's a tough one and in some

901
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,440
cases where we're seeing um AI being

902
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,359
deployed, you know, um pretty much

903
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,800
entering the the scale phase. So, uh,

904
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,320
the industry as a whole, particularly

905
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,160
when it comes to energy and

906
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,680
sustainability, are trying to keep up

907
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,680
with that. And historically, there's

908
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,680
always been that disconnect between

909
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,920
understanding the the hardcore

910
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,920
engineering element of AI and the

911
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,280
traditional sustainability folk. You

912
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,440
kind of think, oh, well, you know, they

913
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,880
don't tend to go hand in hand, but

914
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
actually, we're going to have to bring

915
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,720
that together to to achieve growth in in

916
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,760
both industries.

917
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,920
>> Thank you,

918
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
>> Marsha. I would say from aviation the

919
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,839
biggest misconception is that it's not

920
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,920
really a big deal. Um the uh it feels

921
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,119
like there isn't enough urgency but it

922
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,119
really is an urgent problem. Um so right

923
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,280
now the aviation contribution to to

924
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,040
global warming is really small. Uh but

925
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,880
it's like I pointed out it's it's going

926
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,040
to astronomically grow and it takes a

927
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,880
really long time to penetrate into them

928
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,800
that that market. Uh and I think

929
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,200
unfortunately what we've seen is is sort

930
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,960
of a stalling in investment in in the

931
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,000
aviation sector. So the biggest

932
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,760
misconception is it's fine. It's it's

933
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,720
not fine. It really is at a turning

934
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,280
point right now. Um and I I would say

935
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,599
one one thing I would I want to ask

936
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,960
about is a lot of people whether it was

937
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,880
this morning that had spoke to me about

938
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,800
this potent your talk was they were

939
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,240
looking at leisure or business travel

940
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,560
but there's also a big push to go to

941
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,320
space and I feel that the need for fuel

942
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,320
going to space is a much larger quantity

943
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,720
than you would have for a flight from

944
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,119
the US to England.

945
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,560
>> Yeah. So, so, so that that that's a

946
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,359
whole different challenge. And actually

947
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,200
in this the space industry is thinking

948
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,440
about reusability as well and the

949
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,200
reusability of technology. So, with

950
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,119
space, we've treated um the rocket

951
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,200
engines themselves sort of expendable.

952
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,000
You use it once and it's it's done. Uh

953
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,320
so, thinking about um extending the life

954
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,280
of of space rockets and and airplane

955
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,960
engines, there's actually a lot of

956
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,119
synergy in the technical challenges

957
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,599
there, not not just the fuel.

958
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,359
>> Thank you. Um, all right. I want to give

959
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,800
due respect to the audience here and

960
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,280
we'll just maybe take the ones with the

961
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,320
highest votes. So, number six votes. Do

962
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,079
we think that the government or NESO

963
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,160
others will manage to deliver the net

964
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,520
zero goals that have been set by 2030?

965
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,680
No.

966
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,960
>> So, how how would the lack of green

967
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,280
energy impact sustainable AI growth?

968
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,119
>> Great.

969
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,560
>> I'll let you digest and then answer

970
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,040
will. I guess the starting point uh is

971
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,160
with the with the no from this whoever

972
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,359
asked the the question. Um I'm I'm on

973
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,119
the opposite. I'm I'm a lot more

974
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,920
optimistic actually because I've I've

975
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:33,760
seen um the energy industry in the UK um

976
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,920
go through the ups and downs. Um but I

977
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,480
think with with the Labor government's

978
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,920
agenda in the UK, there's an opportunity

979
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,760
to grow two industries at the same time.

980
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,760
Um, as I said, the key enabler will

981
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,720
actually be the contract for difference

982
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,200
auction coming up early this year. If we

983
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,240
can put the right market incentive in

984
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,040
place for offshore wind, then I do

985
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,240
believe we can get to the 2030 net zero

986
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,880
target. Um, so it it is a bit of a you

987
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,440
know, we got to watch and wait. Um, but

988
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,359
as I said earlier, early indication, the

989
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,440
government has done this before. They

990
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,359
have sent the right price signal. we

991
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,760
have seen offshore wind come online over

992
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,720
the last two years which is a great

993
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,200
starting point. So um yeah let's let's

994
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,119
see but I'm I'm I'm very much optimistic

995
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,599
on on that front. There is a lot of work

996
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,320
being done behind the scenes. So it's uh

997
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,200
not just government and the energy

998
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,359
sector. Um a lot of the big tech players

999
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,440
are investing in some of the innovation.

1000
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,280
So we have seen uh significant

1001
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,119
enhancements in things like data center

1002
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,040
efficiency. You know, historically pee

1003
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,720
factor, power utilization effectiveness,

1004
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,119
which was the the metric that was

1005
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
historically used for u measuring the

1006
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,880
efficiency of data centers, has gone

1007
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,599
from something like 1.8 and we're on the

1008
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,079
verge of, you know, 1.2, 1.1,

1009
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,680
best-in-class, even potentially at one.

1010
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,280
Right? So in the background, we're

1011
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,720
starting to see things um um improve and

1012
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,520
we're starting to see other players

1013
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,920
within the ecosystem act and and

1014
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,160
recognize the importance of this. Um

1015
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,200
because everyone wins, right? If we

1016
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,800
manage to um drive sustainability and AI

1017
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,680
growth, then the guys who want to push

1018
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,920
out the the tech and the AI systems will

1019
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,319
have less barriers to adoption. So

1020
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,160
there's a potential synergy there. So

1021
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,839
yeah, more optimism. Do you think that

1022
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,119
uh the big tech companies will have to

1023
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,359
become more diversified in their

1024
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,079
offering then so as opposed to being

1025
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:31,760
onedimensional historically speaking?

1026
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,599
>> Um it yeah what what is interesting is

1027
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,800
we have seen and you may have caught in

1028
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,119
in in the news a lot of the um

1029
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,560
hyperscalers so they that's the likes of

1030
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,079
Amazon uh Google and Microsoft they're

1031
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,560
already starting to think about how they

1032
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,599
diversify their business. So um we've

1033
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,880
seen a recent spree in terms of their um

1034
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,200
shopping for SMR technology right so uh

1035
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,119
which then creates an interesting

1036
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,040
conversation because that's very much

1037
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,119
focused around energy um they are

1038
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,079
historically and still are very much

1039
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,319
cloud AI technology focused but they're

1040
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,720
having to diversify their business and

1041
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,240
understand the energy sector a lot

1042
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,040
better and as a result they're starting

1043
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,680
to to buy into the SMR technology to try

1044
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,240
and fuel that growth. So, what you might

1045
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,200
see over time potentially is some form

1046
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,839
of premium offering where you have a m a

1047
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,079
sustainable option for cloud computing.

1048
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,920
We'll wait to see um when that happens

1049
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,880
and if it does happen, but we're

1050
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,680
definitely seeing some form of

1051
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,440
diversification there. Thank you. Uh I'm

1052
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,880
going to skip the next one, but since

1053
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,480
they're tied, but this one's from Masha

1054
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,319
since we've given her a moment to to

1055
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,319
take a break here. Uh do we have or

1056
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,480
should we have a right to fly? It's easy

1057
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,240
to hop on a plane, but should we all be

1058
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,400
made to comfort the ethics of this? A

1059
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,440
cap on personal flights? It sort of ties

1060
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,160
into what we were speaking about

1061
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,720
earlier.

1062
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,040
>> It it does. That's a really difficult

1063
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,880
question to answer, isn't it? Um on on

1064
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,319
one hand, we've sort of had the luxury

1065
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,160
of of being able to apply to be

1066
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,560
connected. Uh how can we say at this

1067
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,880
point now that you know the the emerging

1068
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,040
economy that are going to have that

1069
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,800
opportunity to to sort of limit that? So

1070
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,880
so that's a really difficult question. I

1071
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,119
I think being connected should be a

1072
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,480
right that everybody's

1073
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,119
entitled to. Um but but also I I think

1074
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,680
that connection increases productivity.

1075
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,079
So So I uh I was thinking of these

1076
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,920
numbers last night. I I traveled over

1077
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,440
here to London and from from Boston. So

1078
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,520
so obviously that flight had some

1079
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,280
emissions. I I did my my range equation

1080
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,839
and calculated how much fuel was burned

1081
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,960
and the CO2 emissions. Um but I spent

1082
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,800
the week actually traveling to um

1083
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,560
Rolls-Royce who who creates the jet

1084
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,480
engines who create these missions and

1085
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,040
spending time speaking with their

1086
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,560
fundamentalists uh on whiteboards and

1087
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,079
sort of understanding the challenges to

1088
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
implementing the the science and the

1089
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,400
engineering solution that then is going

1090
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,560
to go back into my research and the

1091
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,160
efficiency that's going to come from

1092
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:01,359
those conversations far outweigh the CO2

1093
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,520
that I contributed on the flight over.

1094
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:07,359
So I think that is really important and

1095
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,599
that physical uh human connection should

1096
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,359
not go away because that will continue

1097
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,880
to drive our growth

1098
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,800
>> and and in a way um your two respective

1099
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,160
industries are at heads in a way because

1100
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,040
you want to potentially create more

1101
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,440
content virtually and yet aviation wants

1102
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,040
to fly more people around. Um, is there

1103
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,400
a way you can leverage each other's

1104
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,560
technologies to both be sustainable, get

1105
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,040
people together and offer accessibility

1106
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,920
to people in remote areas?

1107
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,160
>> Absolutely.

1108
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,560
>> Yeah, I think we discussed that actually

1109
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,200
um last week didn't where we were seeing

1110
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,720
there's potential to use digitalization

1111
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,880
and AI as a way of helping the aviation

1112
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,560
um industry become more operationally

1113
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,599
efficient which would reduce the impact

1114
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,920
of fuel going in. So yeah.

1115
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,480
>> Yeah. Exactly. So, so there's a lot of

1116
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,760
um you thinking about how to use AI to

1117
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,000
make um better fuels, right? So, how can

1118
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,839
you use AI with synthetic biology to

1119
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,359
drive the cost of some of these

1120
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,520
sustainable aviation fuels down, the

1121
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,599
energy intensity of those fuels down? Uh

1122
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,280
how can we develop different materials

1123
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,280
that can withstand higher temperatures

1124
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,119
and enable more efficient propulsion?

1125
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,680
So, I think there's a huge opportunity

1126
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,359
for for using AI to to decarbonize in

1127
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,079
the aviation space. And then again,

1128
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:25,960
connecting people together to to

1129
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,960
um to improve

1130
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,200
>> um a question for both of you. We're

1131
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,680
switching gears, but to an older

1132
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,520
technology, nuclear. Uh are very small

1133
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,520
micronuclear reactors the answers to

1134
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,280
both sustainability challenges.

1135
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,760
>> I'll uh I'll I'll mention it from

1136
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,240
aviation first. Absolutely. I we are

1137
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,839
considering this. Um so so nuclear

1138
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,079
reactors have come a long way. You can

1139
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,319
now sort of 3D print the casings that

1140
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,680
the nuclear fuel is in, increasing the

1141
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:56,240
safety. So, so there's a lot of work in

1142
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,839
policy and the technology of putting

1143
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,079
nuclear on aviation, but it's it's not

1144
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,480
science fiction. This is uh an active

1145
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,160
area of of research and watch this

1146
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,920
space.

1147
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,119
>> Yeah. And ju just to add that I guess

1148
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,119
it's very similar from a technology or

1149
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,680
tech sector as a whole because as I

1150
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,200
mentioned earlier uh the the big tech

1151
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,520
companies are investing in this

1152
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,520
technology as a way of decoupling

1153
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,599
themselves away from from the from the

1154
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,680
grid. So there's potential there but I

1155
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,240
think still a lot of research going into

1156
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,480
that space. So longterm I believe it's a

1157
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,560
big part of the energy mix

1158
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,960
>> but in terms of the the the short term

1159
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,880
we might see some smallcale deployments

1160
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,440
until it becomes a bit more commercially

1161
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,040
feasible to scale. Um there might be

1162
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,920
more appetite I mean some countries

1163
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,119
actually ban uh this the technology as a

1164
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,920
whole. So there's there's some other

1165
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,400
barriers to to overcome but is it part

1166
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,160
of the equation? Absolutely.

1167
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,000
>> Yeah. So from a portfolio analysis

1168
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,160
perspective it's good to diversify.

1169
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,359
>> Yeah. for both of your respective

1170
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,040
industries. Is there one of these either

1171
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,599
renewables or older technologies that

1172
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,160
you would prefer or think is the the key

1173
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,000
to advancing it?

1174
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,079
So I think I think it's actually really

1175
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,800
interesting the growth in demand for

1176
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,760
digital and the growth for aviation they

1177
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,319
both at the heart of it require energy

1178
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,720
and we have a lot of renewable energy

1179
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,480
and uh so so so thinking you know I

1180
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,760
spoke a lot about making sustainable

1181
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,000
aviation fuels it requires investment in

1182
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,240
renewable energy but it does that for

1183
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,240
for digitization too. So actually this

1184
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,280
this growth in AI coupled with this

1185
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,000
growth in aviation uh I think enables

1186
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,119
larger investment together for for these

1187
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,760
renewable energy sources. Um so I I

1188
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,520
think in the future uh countries that

1189
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,920
have a lot of renewable resource will

1190
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,319
will take advantage of that to make some

1191
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,560
sort of a fuel that's able to be stored

1192
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:54,400
whether it's uh hydrocarbon fuel or

1193
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,839
hydrogen fuel and that will sort of

1194
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,000
become the new currency of um making and

1195
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:03,200
exporting energy. Uh but that's going to

1196
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,880
benefit both aviation and

1197
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,240
this need for digital AI.

1198
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,319
>> Absolutely. And I think going back to

1199
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,560
your point around storage, that could be

1200
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,560
another the key enabler because if we're

1201
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,839
going to have gas in the short term and

1202
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,560
we're just thinking about how close we

1203
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,560
are to 2030. You do have that

1204
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,400
dispatchable power at your source, but

1205
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,760
how do you make sure you you're meeting

1206
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,359
the demand now? You you look to retrofit

1207
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,960
options and I know you discussed that on

1208
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,720
one of your slides and it's similar.

1209
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,960
There could be an opportunity here for

1210
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,440
for gas storage potentially to to be

1211
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,119
part of that overall mix.

1212
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,200
So if I may, I think the next three

1213
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,200
questions are somewhat related. Um

1214
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,559
trends suggest sustainability is losing

1215
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,160
popularity. Um so is there oh sorry

1216
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,400
would you mind going back to the the

1217
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,760
list for a moment? The reason is so the

1218
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,760
first one is asking about losing

1219
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,359
popularity. The second one is about

1220
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,839
public and political discourse turning

1221
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:57,760
away from the green agenda. And lastly,

1222
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,839
if as a aviation is expected to grow, um

1223
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,520
why are we

1224
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,960
uh when advancements in technology

1225
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,559
should be making remote collaboration

1226
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,280
better? So, I feel that they're there's

1227
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:10,000
somewhat connected from a a public

1228
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,599
policy standpoint um and where we're

1229
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,920
going with either the support and I

1230
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,000
think the discussion about potentially

1231
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,440
data centers and nuclear sort of both

1232
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,040
tie into that nicely.

1233
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,760
>> Yeah, I mean happy to start. Yeah, go

1234
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,720
back and just talk about trends overall.

1235
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,559
So, um, again, we've kind of seen this

1236
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,240
cycle before when it comes to

1237
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:35,200
sustainability. Um, we went probably

1238
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,960
just around COVID, we saw a peak in

1239
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,839
interest in sustainability. Um, and very

1240
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,559
much after that, we saw a phase called

1241
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:47,440
greenwashing, right? Everyone wanted to

1242
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:51,119
be a frontier in in sustainability.

1243
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,559
um regulations came in uh and and things

1244
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,720
a lot more controlled and then we've got

1245
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,880
the geopolitical issues. Um what I've

1246
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,359
noticed over that 5year period is

1247
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,040
actually the demand has not changed so

1248
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,119
much but the narrative has gone from the

1249
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,359
greenwashing to the green hushing. M

1250
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,200
>> so what's essentially happening here is

1251
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,720
organizations are continuing to do what

1252
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,480
they do but they're just not talking

1253
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,880
about it as frequently as they used to

1254
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,960
or they're using a different form of

1255
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,400
language you know instead instead of and

1256
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,119
I'm sure you may have seen this across

1257
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,319
your organizations um instead of netzero

1258
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,000
you may be talking about energy

1259
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,000
resilience they're both very

1260
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,720
interrelated by the way and maybe that's

1261
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,200
what's required to um deal with some of

1262
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,000
the the the political geopolitical

1263
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,680
challenges that that we face so uh from

1264
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,160
what I see and I speak to customers on a

1265
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,400
regular basis the the trend still

1266
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,640
remains and what drives that by the way

1267
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,079
is the end consumer right there that's

1268
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,160
still being driven what's good for

1269
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,920
business a lot of private corporations

1270
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,400
is still driven by the end customer you

1271
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,319
know the the appetite for sustainable

1272
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,400
products from the end consumer is

1273
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,160
growing evidence shows is still growing

1274
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,240
so you know how do you capture that

1275
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:01,680
market segment to continue growing in a

1276
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:03,359
very complex um industry sector etc um

1277
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,680
that has to be a position of growth for

1278
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,359
a lot of companies. So yeah, very much

1279
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,800
on the trend side. We're still seeing it

1280
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,000
remain. It's just a change in terms of

1281
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,960
the language.

1282
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,559
>> I I think there needs to be a role in

1283
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,359
government for this both in

1284
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,640
incentivizing the markets um through

1285
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:23,839
through some sort of market incentiv

1286
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,119
incentives or um mandates. So so I think

1287
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,359
there's there needs to be a clear

1288
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,720
direction from from government uh but

1289
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,040
also as as a thought leader and as as an

1290
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,359
idea. So, so I I'll give you an example.

1291
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,880
Um, when I first came to MIT and started

1292
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,280
teaching thermodynamics and propulsion

1293
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,960
in in the aerrowastro department, uh, I

1294
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,800
asked my students, why are you here? And

1295
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,599
a really large part of them said, I'm

1296
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,160
I'm worried about sustainable aviation.

1297
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,680
Um, and then sort of over a year, the

1298
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,720
national conversation about

1299
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,160
sustainability changed. And I asked the

1300
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,240
new cohort of students, why are you

1301
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,839
here? And not so many of them said that

1302
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,240
anymore. Now they said rockets, they

1303
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,760
said space. Uh but but that didn't seem

1304
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,200
to be a pressing challenge.

1305
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,280
Sustainability sort of left the national

1306
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,240
conversation and it left what our

1307
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,240
students were sort of uh passionate

1308
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,000
about and and I find that very very

1309
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,520
worrisome. So I think the role of the

1310
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,520
government is both to sort of help drive

1311
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,839
the markets, put those incentives in

1312
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,079
that that otherwise um wouldn't get

1313
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,880
people to change. Uh but but second is

1314
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,640
to to set an example for for where we

1315
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,960
should be going.

1316
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,400
Um, thank you. I want to I want to

1317
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,760
continue that thread, but we have about

1318
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,280
a minute left and I want to I want to

1319
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,960
end on a bit of a technological

1320
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,680
question. When quantum computing

1321
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,359
solutions emerge at scale, what will

1322
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,240
happen or what will that do to power

1323
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:47,839
demands?

1324
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:50,880
>> Yeah, that uh similar challenge. I mean,

1325
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,640
quantum's a big part of the the AI

1326
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,280
solution, right? We get more compute

1327
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,720
power. You can do things at super low

1328
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,960
latency, etc. Um, in terms of scale,

1329
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,640
we're not there yet. So, it's difficult

1330
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,160
to say, but again, we go back to the

1331
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,800
graph that I showed earlier in terms of

1332
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,040
the gap from the energy demand. That's

1333
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,599
going to be a decision for uh

1334
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,119
governments ultimately to to to decide

1335
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,960
what's the right incentives that they

1336
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,520
put in place for green infrastructure to

1337
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,680
support support that growth. But the

1338
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,319
idea is if the right incentive is in

1339
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,800
place, let's say come the the CFD

1340
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:27,520
auction this year and we see a growth in

1341
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,599
renewables come online then the cost of

1342
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,319
renewable energy continues to go down as

1343
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,160
the technology advances. We'll see uh

1344
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,319
other forms of technology come online at

1345
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,000
the same time. So in the UK we've got a

1346
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,200
nuclear power station due to come online

1347
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,760
in the midterm. SMRs are are evolving.

1348
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,440
So I believe at that point we'll have a

1349
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,960
plethora of options available. there

1350
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,200
won't be as much of a dilemma

1351
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,720
particularly from a cost perspective.

1352
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,160
>> All right. Well, I think that brings us

1353
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,240
to time. I want to say thank you very

1354
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,839
much to our speakers. Um, and I just

1355
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,440
want to say I think that some of the

1356
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,960
cross threads here was that we are

1357
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,040
living in an interdisciplinary world

1358
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,119
where a lot of these major thrusts are

1359
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,160
connected and collaboration is likely

1360
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,160
the key. So, thank you very much.
