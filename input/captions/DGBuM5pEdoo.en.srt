1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,800
So today is the last day of our additive

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,039
combinotauric section of the class. Um

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,199
and we get to prove one of the core

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,240
theorems of the additive combinotaurics

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,160
the balag sami gowish theorem and I

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
think it's a wonderful thing and I will

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,160
I will try to do it justice. I'm

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,880
learning myself also.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,760
Um, okay. So, first let me remind

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,760
everybody what it says.

11
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,719
All right. So if a and b are in an

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,520
aelion group

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,520
and let's say they have size at most n

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,920
and we have a subset of a cross b. So

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,280
have a subset of pairs little a little b

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,280
uh and it's pretty big. So x is bigger

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,040
than k inverse n^2. So k is a parameter

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
here but you should think of k as being

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
significantly smaller than n is that's

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
the regime where there's a meaningful

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,880
conclusion.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
Okay.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,479
Um and

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:36,320
pi1 of x is at most k.

25
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:41,280
So we remember that pi 1 of x is the set

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,280
of a + b where a and b a comma b is an

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
x.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay. So this is surprisingly small

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,079
given how large x is and it means that

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,960
in in this set um there are many pairs a

31
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,399
a1 b1 and a2 b2 that that add up to the

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,560
same number. So there are a lot of

33
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
additive coincidences happening when we

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,440
add up the pairs in x.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,280
Then the conclusion is

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,400
that there is uh a subset a prime in a

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,560
and a subset b prime in b which are

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,480
pretty big.

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
So the way we'll say that they're pretty

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,400
big. So we we we could say the following

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
is true that a and b are each uh you

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,879
know at least some power of k * n. So

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
they're each pretty big. But actually

44
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,520
we'll say something slightly fancier

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,720
which is what we really used in

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:41,280
applications. Namely if x prime is

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:45,640
defined to be the part of x in prime

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,640
um then x prime is pretty big.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,879
Okay. And also when you look take sums

50
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
of a prime and b prime not just the ones

51
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,120
in x prime but all of them those are all

52
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,959
pretty small.

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:11,720
So um a prime plus b prime is less than

54
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,720
k to the big o of 1 *

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,480
okay

56
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,319
so I guess la last time we introduced

57
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,680
this and talked about examples a little

58
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
bit but let me just repeat the example

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
because it helps a lot to digest the

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,360
statement. So, here's one example.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,920
Um, A and B are both the numbers up to N

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,920
with some garbage.

63
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,120
And, uh,

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
um,

65
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:58,400
um, okay. And then x

66
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,799
could be any subset of n cross n which

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,799
is pretty big.

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Um

69
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,360
and so now it's not true that a + b is

70
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,720
small but it is true that uh a good

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,720
maybe union a little bit

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,960
Okay. So, pi1 of x is small because most

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,800
of it is contained in most of x is

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,960
contained in here and and pi one of that

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,520
is small. Um, so

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,360
a + b might be large.

77
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,680
Um,

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,919
but pi1 of x is small.

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,560
And the only way this can happen is that

80
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,800
uh in this case a big chunk of x most of

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,800
x is contained in a product that

82
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,280
actually has a small subset. So a prime

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,280
= b prime.

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,440
Okay. Does the statement make sense?

85
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,039
All right. All right. Cool. Um cool. So

86
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,680
uh yeah I tell you a little bit of

87
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,680
history of this theorem.

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
So Balog and some Ready were the first

89
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,800
people to think about this and they

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,840
proved a version of this theorem. But uh

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,039
in Balag and Sam's theorem this k the

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,680
minus bigo of one was much worse. So

93
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:42,560
here there was some um so in baletti

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,320
there was like one over some function of

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,039
k

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,199
and over here in balog saretti there was

97
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,280
some function of k and this function of

98
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
k was really terrible. It was worse than

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,800
like a it was worse than a tower of

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
exponentials.

101
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,479
um and it followed from something called

102
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,120
sretd's regularity lema which is a

103
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,440
really important um qualitative fact in

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
graph theory in combinotaurics which has

105
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,120
many consequences but it's well known

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,800
that the bounds in somebody's regularity

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,960
lema are really terrible and that's

108
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,000
where these really terrible bounds come

109
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,199
from now in someday's regularity lema

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,680
those really terrible bounds are the

111
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
best thing that's true more or less um

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,080
but in some of the applications they're

113
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,759
not and Gers revisited this and he

114
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,319
proved this thing with the polinomial

115
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,319
dependence.

116
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,319
Okay.

117
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,479
Okay. So, the proof that I'm going to

118
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,199
show you is from the 1990s. So, it's

119
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,840
really not that old. Um, it's been very

120
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,520
influential and it's not that

121
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
complicated. it's clever, but it's

122
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,000
something that we can do in a class and

123
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,440
that um you know that this is a

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
significant thing and I hope you know

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,639
that it's it's I think it's something

126
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,360
worth seeing and worth knowing about.

127
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,360
All right.

128
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,120
So yeah, so any questions or comments

129
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:11,919
before we start the proof?

130
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,479
Okay, so X is a subset of A cross B and

131
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,360
we're going to visualize it as a

132
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,479
bipartite graph.

133
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,759
I'm going to visualize

134
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,400
x which is a subset of a cross b. So

135
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,960
over here I have a which I'll visualize

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,960
as a bunch of dots. Over here I'll have

137
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,840
b which I'll visualize as a bunch of

138
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,160
dots. And um if a comma b is an x then I

139
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,000
will visualize that by drawing an edge

140
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:47,039
from a to b. So the set x will look

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,039
something like this.

142
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:56,360
So in this picture, a comma b is an x if

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,360
and only if I have an edge.

144
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Okay.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,360
Um and now there turns out to be a nice

146
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,520
connection between the um some graph

147
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,919
theory things you can see in this graph

148
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,919
and the additive combinatorics of of A

149
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,160
and B.

150
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:31,199
Um so let me make a definition that P

151
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:34,560
subk of A to B is the number of paths

152
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,240
that have length K

153
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,440
and they go from A to B,

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,159
right? And they're paths in this graph

155
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,159
in the graph X.

156
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Um, so

157
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,399
I had to take P3 of A, B is going to be

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
very important in our story. How many

159
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,640
ways are there to get from A to B in

160
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,360
three steps? So there's

161
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,200
uh there may not be any in the picture

162
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519
right now.

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,880
Let me add an edge. So there's one way

164
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,800
to get from A to B in three steps. And

165
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
uh here's another way to get from A to B

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,040
in three steps. P3 of AB is counting how

167
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:21,279
many ways there are to do that.

168
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,680
All right. So, here's a lama.

169
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,760
Um,

170
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,600
uh,

171
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
okay.

172
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,480
>> Question.

173
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,720
>> Yeah.

174
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,560
>> Are the paths allowed to repeat nodes?

175
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,760
>> They are allowed to repeat nodes. Yeah,

176
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
you're right. So, they might have been

177
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,399
some I didn't count before. So, that is

178
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,880
also a path of length three from A to B.

179
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,880
Yeah. Thank you.

180
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:51,760
Okay. Um, so if I have a prime in A and

181
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,279
B prime in B, right? Right. So if you,

182
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
okay, if you look where we where we want

183
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,839
to go, we'd like to eventually prove

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,560
that for some sets that we haven't found

185
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399
yet, uh, that A prime plus B prime is

186
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,320
small. So how are we going to prove

187
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,000
that? Um, A prime plus B prime, the size

188
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
of A prime plus B prime is going to be

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,080
related to the paths of length three in

190
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,519
this graph.

191
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,800
So if if I have this and if for every

192
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,800
pair a and b a and a prime and b and b

193
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
prime

194
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,920
there are lots of pads between them

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,470
then a prime plus b prime isn't very

196
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,600
big.

197
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:43,160
[Applause]

198
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,160
It's less than pi 1 at x cubed over p.

199
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,720
Okay. So let's let's prove this lema.

200
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,480
All right. So let's visualize a path of

201
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,480
length three from A to B.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,040
So it looks like this.

203
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,399
There's your path of length three. And

204
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,440
what is this telling us? Well, this edge

205
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:32,640
tells me that a comma b1 is in x, right?

206
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:35,920
And therefore a + b1 is in pi 1 of x.

207
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,320
And this edge tells me similarly that a1

208
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:44,240
+ b1 is in pi 1 of x. And this edge

209
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,560
tells me similarly that a1 + b is in pi

210
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,560
1 of x.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,240
Okay. Now I'm interested in a plus b and

212
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:02,560
a plus b is kind of related to these

213
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:06,320
guys. And so we can write a + b as

214
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,600
uh a + b1

215
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,720
minus a1 + b1

216
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,720
plus uh

217
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,279
a1 + b.

218
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,320
Did I do this right? A plus b. The a1's

219
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,720
cancel and the b1's cancel.

220
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,920
And these three characters are they

221
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,600
correspond to these three edges.

222
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,200
So let's call this Z1,

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Z2

224
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,440
and Z3.

225
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:48,399
Okay. So we have seen

226
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:54,399
that the uh number of triples Z1, Z2, Z3

227
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:59,200
and P1 of X cubed. So that uh a + b is

228
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:02,800
z1 minus z2 + z3.

229
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,320
That number of triples is at least

230
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,760
um

231
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,760
p3 a to b.

232
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,880
Okay.

233
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,320
So if there are a lot of paths from A to

234
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,200
B of length three, then there are a lot

235
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,240
of ways of writing A plus B by combining

236
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,240
guys in pi 1 of X.

237
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,120
All right.

238
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Um

239
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,000
okay. And we're supposing that P3 of AB

240
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,000
is always at least P. So we have this

241
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:58,880
Okay. And then we can conclude from this

242
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:03,360
that the size of a + b time p is at most

243
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,880
pi 1 and x cubed.

244
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,959
Because for every sum in a plus b, I can

245
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,680
write this sum as z1 minus z2 plus z3 at

246
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,480
least p different ways.

247
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,480
And for each Z1, Z2, and Z3, this is

248
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,639
only going to give me one number when I

249
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,639
do it.

250
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,199
A prime, B,

251
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,199
>> those are A prime and B prime, right?

252
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,760
Okay. So, I'm digesting along with all

253
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,959
of you and as I've been reading the

254
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,639
proof, I've been trying to figure out

255
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,160
how did people think to do this and do

256
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,760
these different things. Um, all right.

257
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,320
So let's try to give some

258
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,440
uh big picture strategy why we might

259
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,720
look at this.

260
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,480
So pi 1 of x is small. That tells us

261
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,199
that there are a lot of coincidences

262
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,720
where you can write a a number as a plus

263
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:08,279
b in a lot of different ways.

264
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,279
And how might that be helpful? Um

265
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,639
um what and then we are

266
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,959
uh okay and so the fact that pi 1 of x

267
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,440
is small that tells us that there are

268
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,440
going to be a lot of edges. What do I

269
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
say?

270
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,920
Okay. Um so so okay sorry by assumption

271
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,760
there are a lot of edges in this graph.

272
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,120
Um that's one of our hypotheses that X

273
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,560
is big. So there are a lot of edges in

274
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
this graph and therefore

275
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,160
there are pro there are lots of lengths

276
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,680
of path three in this paths of length

277
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,120
three in this graph. We'll figure that

278
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,720
out later. Um and when there are many

279
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,680
different paths of length three between

280
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,519
two these two guys then it means that

281
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,920
there are lots of ways of representing a

282
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,440
plus b

283
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,839
combining guys in pi 1 of x. And on the

284
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
other hand, if pi 1 of x is small, then

285
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,440
that that should make this not too

286
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,440
large.

287
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Okay, I don't know if that I I don't

288
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
think that really explained how somebody

289
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
might have thought to do this, but it's

290
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,120
fairly short, so I hope it Let's take a

291
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,199
second and see uh

292
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,880
let you digest a little bit and see if

293
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,759
if people have anything to add. Yeah. uh

294
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,120
the kind of idea of sort of the paths of

295
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,279
sort of three different things looks

296
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,639
kind of like you're taking like a minus

297
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,920
a plus a and sort of it's being similar

298
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,079
to the kind of contentious structure

299
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,839
idea like is there kind of a link to to

300
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,399
those those

301
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,040
>> Yeah. So so the question is it this felt

302
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,920
a little bit like like Plunka and is

303
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,600
there a link to the Plunka inequality?

304
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,600
Um

305
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
maybe.

306
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
>> Yeah.

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,399
>> Yeah.

308
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,079
>> Is there something special about paths

309
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,760
of length three? Like it seems like this

310
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,439
should work for any odd number of

311
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,520
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question is why did

312
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,959
we pick paths of length three? There's

313
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,280
really nothing special about paths of

314
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,959
length three. Um there we would be some

315
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,520
similar estimate for any length. Um and

316
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,959
um three is the length where where the

317
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,360
later part of the proof we managed to

318
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,360
get it to work.

319
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,919
Okay.

320
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,520
All right. Cool. So next let's um let's

321
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,039
think a bit about how many edges there

322
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,400
are in this graph and how many paths

323
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,840
there are of length two and how many

324
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
paths there are of length three and

325
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,760
stuff like that. Let's just sort of

326
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:53,120
orient ourselves to this graph.

327
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:56,600
Uh so okay, I'll call this uh some

328
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,600
basic estimates

329
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,640
about PK

330
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,240
PK of AB.

331
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,919
Ah okay. No actually let me let me frame

332
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
it this way. Let me state a lema about

333
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,360
paths of length three and then we'll

334
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,360
start to to to do some things about

335
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,559
that. So to finish the proof of balac

336
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,440
summar there's a key lema and it's just

337
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,360
a lema in graph theory.

338
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,559
So there's so all of the additive

339
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,039
structure went into like writing this

340
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,880
and noticing that things cancel. And now

341
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,360
we have a graph theory lema about paths

342
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,120
of length three in a graph. So the main

343
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:38,000
lema says that if x is in a cross b and

344
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,600
x is bigger than k inverse times the

345
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,520
size of a time the size of b

346
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:49,960
um then there are big sets with lots of

347
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,960
uh with lots of pads between them.

348
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay. So then there exists a prime and a

349
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,000
and b prime and b.

350
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:07,039
So that if we define x prime is the part

351
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,760
of x and a prime cross b prime then x

352
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,760
prime is pretty big.

353
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,480
And

354
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:26,160
for every A and A prime and B and B

355
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,080
prime um the number of length three

356
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:35,559
paths from A to B is at least

357
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,559
K to the minus O of 1 AB.

358
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,440
Okay. So if you combine this lema and

359
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,200
this key lema and just put them

360
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,600
together, you get the balm gore. And the

361
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,000
the the reason that three appears here

362
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,039
is it's the smallest number where this

363
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,039
key lema is true.

364
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,960
Okay? So I'll let you in your mind just

365
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,760
fill in

366
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,440
this is our P

367
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,039
and fill it in for P over here

368
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,240
and you do a little algebra and that's

369
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,240
the B summary G there.

370
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Okay.

371
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,120
So, if it's okay with everybody, I'm

372
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,960
going to erase this and the rest of the

373
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,880
class we just focus on proving this lema

374
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,280
from graph theory or the rest of the

375
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,280
proof of BSG

376
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,039
locked.

377
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,880
So let's orient ourselves a little bit

378
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,559
um about how many paths there are in

379
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,400
this graph between different points and

380
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,760
and prove some simple things first

381
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:17,760
before we prove this.

382
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,760
So I'll call this uh simple bounds

383
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,760
about

384
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,760
PK.

385
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,640
All right.

386
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Um

387
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,720
All right. So first let's think about um

388
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,720
how many edges there are in this graph.

389
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,000
So um the number of edges

390
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,960
is the size of X which is at least K

391
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,960
inverse A.

392
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,799
And then let's think about how many

393
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,480
paths there are of different lengths. So

394
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:03,280
if I write PK without an A or B, this is

395
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,440
the number of paths of length K.

396
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,280
And they could start or end anywhere.

397
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,679
But I I will just make the restriction

398
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,520
that they start in A. Turns out it's in

399
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,120
a bipartite graph. It's helpful. It's

400
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,840
sort of simpler to count things like

401
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,480
this.

402
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,559
Okay. So P1

403
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,320
is just the number of edges in the

404
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,480
graph. Passive length one are just

405
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,640
individual edges. So this is the size of

406
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,640
X which is at least K inverse 8.

407
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:43,760
Okay. Now a helpful thing to talk about

408
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:46,960
is if if you um is the the neighborhood

409
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,120
of any vertex. So if I have a vertex A

410
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,039
over here,

411
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,200
this is A and this is B and I have a

412
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,280
vertex A over here. There are some edges

413
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,880
coming out of it.

414
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,480
And

415
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,000
this set here is called the

416
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
neighborhood.

417
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,919
And you can do it in the other direction

418
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,799
also. So neighborhood. different up

419
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,799
here, right?

420
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,520
>> There are two different K's. Yeah, there

421
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:14,520
are two different K's. I apologize.

422
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. Here, let's do this.

423
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,039
Okay.

424
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:33,600
So P2 actually before we um

425
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,840
so that's the size of P1 and then if I

426
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,720
were to take

427
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:44,960
the average A and A of P1 of A to

428
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,080
anywhere that would be P1 divided by the

429
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,440
size of A and so that would be at least

430
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,320
K inverse times the size of B. So this

431
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,520
is the average degree of one of these

432
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,679
vertices on the left and it's at least a

433
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,919
decent fraction of all the vertices on

434
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,679
the right.

435
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,159
All right. Now let's think about paths

436
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,320
of length two.

437
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:12,320
So P2

438
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,320
path a path of length two um looks like

439
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
this.

440
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,200
So there's some guy B that it goes

441
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
through here and then there there has to

442
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,440
do somebody who goes to B and somebody

443
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,000
who comes from B. So this is the sum

444
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,000
over B of the size of neighborhood of B

445
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
squ.

446
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,960
Okay. Well, if I just were to take the

447
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,760
sum over B of the size of neighborhood

448
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,440
of B, that would count the edges. So

449
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,799
whenever I'm interested in the sum of

450
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,880
somebody squared and I have a nice

451
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,679
formula for the sum of somebody then it

452
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,080
makes sense to apply Koshy Schwarz.

453
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:57,120
If you apply Koshy Schwarz here, you get

454
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:00,080
the sum of N of B quantity squared over

455
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,679
the size of B.

456
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,600
So that's at least K inverse size of A

457
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:11,840
size of B all squared over the size of

458
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:17,240
B. Um, and that works out to k the minus

459
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,240
2 a a^ 2 b.

460
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,559
Okay, now that kind of makes sense. So

461
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,720
for reference, if we had the complete

462
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,120
graph with all the edges, the number of

463
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
paths of length two would be a^2 b. You

464
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,760
pick somebody in a, you pick somebody in

465
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,279
b, you pick somebody in a. And so this

466
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,000
says that the fraction of them is at

467
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,440
least k to the minus2.

468
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,159
And that kind of makes sense because the

469
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,080
fraction of edges is k the minus1 and we

470
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,559
want two different edges to both be in

471
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,200
our path. So that that makes k the

472
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,720
minus2 a good reference point

473
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,080
and it's not necessarily equal to that.

474
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
It's greater than or equal to that. And

475
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,559
the reason is our edges may not be

476
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,799
distributed evenly. So if if some

477
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,240
vertices have way more edges than others

478
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,039
that will cause the number of paths of

479
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,039
length two to go up.

480
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay. And again we can take the average.

481
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,600
So if I were to take the average over a1

482
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,480
and a2 of the number of paths from a1 to

483
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:20,360
a2 that would be at least I would divide

484
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,360
by a^ 2 so k -2 * b

485
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,600
okay and as an exercise you can keep

486
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:31,520
going to uh to longer lengths so

487
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,799
exercise is that p3

488
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,320
is at least k the minus3

489
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:40,720
a^2 B^2 A^2 B^2 would be the number of

490
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,960
pads of length 3 in the complete graph

491
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,039
and at least a K to the minus3 fraction

492
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,240
of them are pads in our smaller graph.

493
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:54,080
Um, and that means that if I take the

494
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,559
average on A and B of the number of

495
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:03,559
paths of length three from A to B,

496
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,559
that's at least kus 3 * A * B.

497
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,120
So if I pick two

498
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,880
two random vertices and I count the

499
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,840
number of paths of length three on

500
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,520
average it's at least this big.

501
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,840
All right. Now let's compare that to the

502
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,480
key lema.

503
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,480
Kil lama says

504
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,200
that I can find sub substantial

505
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,960
substantial subsets so that um within

506
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,440
these substantial subsets the number of

507
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,520
paths of length three is always say k to

508
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,679
the minus 100 size of a size of b

509
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,200
right so

510
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,760
so this number here is like a small

511
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,679
fraction of the average.

512
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,360
I'm looking for pairs where the number

513
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,279
of paths of length three is at least a

514
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,159
small fraction of the average.

515
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,960
Okay. Um but the thing that makes this

516
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,039
tricky is I don't want just like some

517
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,880
A's and B's or most of the A's and B's

518
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,600
to be at least a small fraction of the

519
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,000
average. I want actually for every A and

520
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,919
B in our in our subset. I want them to

521
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,919
be at least some fraction of the of the

522
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,919
average.

523
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,760
Okay, cool.

524
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:32,399
So now um we're eventually going to go

525
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,919
up to paths of length three. Yeah,

526
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,600
>> for

527
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,880
we don't need them to be all of them,

528
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:43,120
right? Like if if 80% of uh a price had

529
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,720
a lot of paths between them, then could

530
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:52,720
we still not have this long hole or just

531
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:55,590
like a worse bound? Ah, great. Okay.

532
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,600
So the question is

533
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,559
[Applause]

534
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,520
in this lema as written we have assumed

535
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,399
that for every a and b in a prime and b

536
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,480
prime we have a lot of paths which then

537
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,039
matches the the key lema. But the

538
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,960
question is did we really need that in

539
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,679
this lema or could we have relaxed a

540
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,799
little bit over here.

541
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:24,120
Um, so suppose instead of this lema that

542
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,120
we only had this for most A's and B's.

543
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,320
So let's do a little experiment. So in

544
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,320
blue I'll I'll put an experiment.

545
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,880
Okay. Okay. And the experiment is that

546
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,880
instead of this I'm going to say for 90%

547
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,440
of of pairs a prime b prime and a prime

548
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,880
cross b.

549
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,880
Okay. So now let's see what would

550
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,880
happen.

551
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Okay.

552
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,960
So

553
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:21,760
if I take an element of this sum

554
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,600
um before I knew that

555
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:29,320
so that let's say a prime plus b prime

556
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,320
is in this sum

557
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,640
and then I can say that then then I'm

558
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,640
going to use this thing

559
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:46,720
[Music]

560
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:50,000
Now if I knew that 99% of the guys in

561
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,640
this sum could be represented by a good

562
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,279
pair a prime b prime I would be happy.

563
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,039
But that's not what I have written in my

564
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,840
experiment.

565
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,760
So my anxiety is 90% of the a primes and

566
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,440
b primes are good. They have lots of

567
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,840
paths.

568
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,039
10% of them are bad. But then I take the

569
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,240
sum set and the 90% produce a few sums

570
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,480
but the 10% produce a ton of sums. I'll

571
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,480
make a picture.

572
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:27,919
So here's a prime cross b prime. Um this

573
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,840
part of it is good. Good means

574
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,679
that.

575
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:38,200
And this here's the 10% that's bad.

576
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,200
Then I take the sum operation

577
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:46,120
and but now life changes. So so pi one

578
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,120
of good is tiny

579
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,640
pi one of bad is huge.

580
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:05,919
All right. And now I go down here and

581
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,640
for for each of these sums uh if the

582
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,440
sums are good they they get counted many

583
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,080
times. If sums are bad they don't. Um

584
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,760
but this this isn't going to work. uh if

585
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,279
pi one of bad

586
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,279
>> thought if instead of assuming for 90%

587
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,440
if we just if we assume that the average

588
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:29,760
is bigger than p then at this step

589
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,919
if we added together every p3 a

590
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,679
then would we get the same like it would

591
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,720
be the sum of 3 a over each a would be

592
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,159
less than the guys in pi 1 of x cubed

593
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,640
and then the sum of them will be the

594
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,919
number times the average

595
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,200
>> yeah so because there's another

596
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,440
suggestion but I think it's sort of

597
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,360
similar. Um the other suggestion was

598
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,000
instead of a 90% we could take the

599
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,240
average over a prime b prime. Yeah. But

600
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,720
the so okay so but the issue is that

601
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,640
when we we look sometimes at a prime

602
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,279
cross b prime and sometimes we look at a

603
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,840
prime plus b prime

604
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,240
and

605
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,320
the their notions of average may be very

606
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,720
different from each other because there

607
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,559
may be a big chunk of a prime cross b

608
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,640
prime which is compressed a lot when you

609
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,640
add and another chunk which is not.

610
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,640
So um so we need to know that even when

611
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,440
you look at a so when you look at a

612
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,760
prime plus b prime we don't need every

613
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,640
sum to uh have a lot of representatives

614
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,960
we just need most of them but it's hard

615
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,760
to keep track of the way a prime cross b

616
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,360
prime is related to a prime plus b prime

617
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,200
and it seems to be the case that the

618
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,320
easiest way to know that most of the

619
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:47,159
sums are good is to actually know that

620
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,159
all of a prime cross b prime is good.

621
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,080
Yeah.

622
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,919
>> Okay. Great questions. Yeah.

623
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,600
>> Could you get around this issue by

624
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,760
requiring that kind of the bad subset is

625
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,159
small that it display the size as one

626
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,559
over the square root of the size of a

627
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,360
because that way when you

628
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,000
project down we'll square it but it will

629
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,960
still be relatively small.

630
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,839
>> Right. Right. Okay. So the the comment

631
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,399
was that if we were to replace 90% by 1

632
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,480
minus epsilon and if we tuned epsilon to

633
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,599
be really really small eventually this

634
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,720
would work. Um and that sounds right to

635
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,639
me. Um we'll keep our eye out for the

636
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,679
rest of the proof. Uh perhaps that will

637
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,079
allow us to simplify things but but

638
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,079
it might not.

639
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,040
Yeah. Okay. Great.

640
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,440
All right, so let's remember where we

641
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,760
are. We're trying to prove the key lema

642
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,079
that I can choose big subsets so that

643
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,320
for every pair A and B, there are lots

644
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
of length three paths between them. And

645
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,800
for every maybe we could relax to like

646
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,159
almost almost every but anyway, it's not

647
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,280
it's not that hard. It's actually not

648
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,760
that hard to prove this just a little.

649
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,599
Uh okay. So so the reason we use three

650
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,599
here is that um I well I think that this

651
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,359
is false with two if you replaced it

652
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:13,760
with two. I don't quite have a counter

653
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,200
example, but um uh anyway, but so but

654
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,560
still we're going to warm up by talking

655
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,920
about paths of length two because

656
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,280
they're simpler than paths of length

657
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,200
three and we'll prove some kind of

658
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,480
weaker version for paths of length two

659
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,480
that we'll use as a stepping stone.

660
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Okay.

661
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:01,880
All right.

662
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,880
So, paths of length two

663
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,560
All right. So, lama.

664
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:20,680
So, x is a subset of a cross b and it's

665
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,680
pretty big

666
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,800
and we have a parameter epsilon bigger

667
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,480
than zero.

668
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,480
Then I can choose subsets.

669
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:43,200
Um there's actually just one subset just

670
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:46,440
subset a prime. Um so that a prime is

671
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,440
pretty big

672
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,160
and um

673
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,520
p2 of a1

674
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,119
a2

675
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:07,839
is at least epsilon k the minus2 * b. Um

676
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,320
now not for every pair a1 a2. We're

677
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,119
going to weaken that a little bit, but

678
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,240
for with an exceptional set of only

679
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,240
about an epsilon fraction.

680
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,119
Okay.

681
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,359
So actually the people who set this up

682
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,839
had a thought that was similar to yours

683
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,119
which is that let's allow an epsilon

684
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,480
fraction of of of bad pairs and we'll

685
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,280
make that a parameter and then we'll see

686
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,320
what we can do. Um and actually we put

687
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:52,480
an epsilon in two different places and

688
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,720
um so okay. All right. So let's let's

689
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,040
process this first.

690
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,520
Um remember that the average number of

691
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,000
paths from A1 to A2 if we average over

692
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,200
all the choices A1 A2 is at least this

693
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,320
big. So we're going to be at least an

694
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,480
epsilon fraction of the average.

695
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,160
And um we're going that's going to be

696
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,160
true not all the time but except for

697
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,320
about an epsilon fraction of pairs.

698
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,480
Okay. And a prime is a decent decent

699
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,480
size M.

700
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Okay.

701
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
All right. So before we try to prove

702
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:36,160
this, let me ask a question to people.

703
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,119
So question

704
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,119
um can we just take a prime to be all of

705
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,119
a

706
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,599
right.

707
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,520
So then we would just keep this part

708
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:54,000
like is it plausible that um the number

709
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:59,079
of paths is at least an epsilon fraction

710
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,079
of the average most of the time.

711
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,880
Doesn't sound so crazy. Is it possible

712
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,880
that that's always true?

713
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,320
Yeah. So there's a question, what's the

714
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,240
maximum that this could be? The maximum

715
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,760
it could be is B because there are paths

716
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,520
that'll start at A1, they'll go across

717
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,119
to somebody in B, they'll come back to

718
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,640
A2. So there are at most B of them. So

719
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,079
there's, you know, a decent amount of

720
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,079
range there. And that is important.

721
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,079
Yeah.

722
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,640
Oh, the answer to this question is no.

723
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,599
And here's a here's an example. Yeah.

724
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,480
Was there a comment?

725
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:07,680
>> I was thinking, could you maybe have two

726
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:10,720
points in A and connect them by every

727
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,240
point in B and then every other point in

728
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:19,160
A is not very connected.

729
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,160
>> Yeah. Okay. So, our suggestion was

730
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:29,400
I take two points in A and I connect

731
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,400
them to all the points in B.

732
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,960
Right? Um and then the rest of them are

733
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,040
not very connected.

734
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,640
Now two of them might not be enough but

735
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,920
it will we'll take a few of them.

736
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,599
There's B. Here's A. This is a small

737
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,680
piece.

738
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,320
I guess this could be small part of a.

739
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,920
And then over here there are no edges

740
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,760
going out of there at all. Right. Um so

741
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,760
how big would this have to be? Well, we

742
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,560
need a fraction 1 over k of all the

743
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,920
edges in our graph. Um so this small

744
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,480
part of a would have size 1 over k times

745
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,160
all of a. And now I have a one over k

746
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,720
fraction of all the edges. Okay. So if I

747
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,839
pick A1 and A2 in here, I have a ton of

748
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,000
paths between them. But if either one of

749
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,680
them is out here, there are no paths

750
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,040
between them. And um you know this this

751
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,359
set is actually much bigger than that

752
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,440
set. So for almost all the pairs in A,

753
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,760
there are no paths between them. So this

754
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,920
is a counter example. Good. Good. Okay.

755
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,160
And there's a second counter example

756
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,960
which is uh so in this counter example

757
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,760
the suspicious feature is that these

758
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,760
vertices have way fewer edges than those

759
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,760
vertices.

760
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,680
Could I also make a counter example

761
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,079
where every vertex on both sides has the

762
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,280
same degree?

763
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,640
Yes, you can. And it works by dividing

764
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,880
into clumps. So I have a first clump. I

765
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,359
have all the edges in here. And then I

766
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,280
have a second clump

767
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,520
and I have all the edges here

768
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,760
and so on. So if you do this and you

769
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,359
have k clumps of the same size then

770
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,319
you'll see you have about one overk of

771
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,800
all the edges. And then if you pick a1

772
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,480
and a2 if you pick them in different

773
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,400
clumps then there are no paths between

774
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,800
them. If you pick them in the same clump

775
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,880
there are lots of paths.

776
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,040
So because of these two examples we

777
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,480
cannot just take a prime to be a

778
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,400
all right and these so okay so so we so

779
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,240
we have to understand we need to pick a

780
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,359
prime and now let's think about how are

781
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,480
we going to pick a prime

782
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,280
um and in both these examples the way to

783
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,599
find a plausible A prime is to pick some

784
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,520
B and then look at its neighborhood.

785
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,200
So here I pick some B and I look at its

786
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,359
neighborhood. That's the set I this is.

787
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,599
So this should be A prime, right? And

788
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,280
here I pick some B anywhere and I look

789
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,240
at its neighborhood and this is a

790
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,240
reasonable choice for A prime.

791
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,520
Okay.

792
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,520
So

793
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,680
so we will take

794
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:25,319
a prime

795
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,319
to be the neighborhood of B for some B.

796
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,640
All right.

797
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,720
So now, okay. So let me make a

798
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,520
definition.

799
00:43:50,720 --> 00:44:00,720
I'll say a pair a1 a2 is called epsilon

800
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,720
bad if the number of paths from a1 to a2

801
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,200
of length 2 is smaller than our

802
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,200
threshold there.

803
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,200
All right. So the main thing we have to

804
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,560
think about is uh I'm going to pick

805
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,720
different bees and look at their

806
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,200
neighborhoods. And for each neighborhood

807
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,800
I want to count how many bad pairs there

808
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,720
are.

809
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,160
So

810
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:30,319
BP epsilon of B is the number of pairs

811
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,800
A1 A2

812
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,400
that are in that are both in the

813
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,960
neighborhood of B. So that A1 A2 is

814
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,960
epsilon bad.

815
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,280
All right. So we'd like to know how big

816
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,040
that about how big that is. And the

817
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,040
easiest thing to compute is its

818
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,359
expectation.

819
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:57,760
So lamma expectation over b of the size

820
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,400
of this thing

821
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,880
um is not too crazy. So let's see what

822
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,880
what that means.

823
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,680
Okay. So this is at most epsilon

824
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:18,960
fraction k the minus 2 a^2.

825
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,480
All right. So let's let's digest this.

826
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,160
So wait so we'll prove this of course

827
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,200
but let's let's digest the right hand

828
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,599
side. Um so these bad pairs they're

829
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,599
sitting in just the set of all pairs. So

830
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,560
for reference we should think about you

831
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,760
know how big is the set of all pairs.

832
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:39,040
Um, so

833
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,520
take the expected value over B of just

834
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,839
the size of its neighborhood squared.

835
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,319
That's at least kus 2 a^ 2. This has an

836
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,839
easy proof that we'll do in a second.

837
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,480
All right. So if you compare these, you

838
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:55,599
see that the fraction of epsilon bad

839
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,400
pairs is at most is a small fraction of

840
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,720
the of the total pairs. Fraction of

841
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,359
epsilon by bad pairs is at most epsilon

842
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,359
on average.

843
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,880
Okay. And that's good. That's the sort

844
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,560
of thing we we want to prove. We want to

845
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,200
prove there's only about an epsilon

846
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,359
fraction of bad pairs.

847
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:19,760
Okay. So, um,

848
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,920
so let's call this lama p1 and lama p2.

849
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,359
This one is is real easy. So, I can I

850
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,119
can keep it on this board. And then

851
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,440
we'll prove lama p1, which is the most

852
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,040
important thing. Okay. So, lama p2

853
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,079
proof.

854
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:37,079
Um if I take the sum on B of N of B ^2

855
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,079
um

856
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,839
when you see this what does it make you

857
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,119
want to do?

858
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:49,119
Actually we already did it

859
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:52,720
short. So this is the sum on B n of B

860
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:57,599
quantity squared over the size of B.

861
00:46:52,720 --> 00:47:00,960
That's at least k inverse a b all

862
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:06,079
squared over the size of b. That's at

863
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:08,319
least k to the minus 2 a^ 2 b.

864
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:14,280
And to turn the sum into an average, we

865
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:14,280
divide by b by size of b and that's

866
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,440
all right. Actually, we could say an

867
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,640
even e even simpler thing. The so what's

868
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,960
the average size of just n of b? U the

869
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,640
average size of n is exactly k inverse

870
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,400
times the size of a and so well okay by

871
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,720
koshy schwarz then if you square it it's

872
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,720
at least that

873
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,920
okay great so the heart of the matter

874
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,000
for for this lema is that the x the

875
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,680
expected number of bad pairs is a lot

876
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
less than the expected number of total

877
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,000
pairs so let's prove this lema

878
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:23,880
All right. So proof of lema P1.

879
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:32,640
Okay. So again let's think about the sum

880
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:35,960
on B of the size of BPs

881
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,960
of B.

882
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:43,839
All right.

883
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,800
So this is a set of pairs A1 A2.

884
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,400
So this is a number of things. This is a

885
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,960
double counting argument. It's a number

886
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:57,200
of a1, a2 and b.

887
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:03,480
So that a few things hold. Um so first

888
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,480
of all we have this connection pattern.

889
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:13,040
And also a1 and a2 are bad which means

890
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:19,319
the number of paths from a1 to a2 is at

891
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,319
most epsilon k theus 2b.

892
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,200
All right. So how should we count this?

893
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,720
Initially we put the b on the outside.

894
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,319
But to count this quantity, it's a lot

895
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,480
easier to pick A1 and A2 first

896
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,160
because then after we fix A1 and A2,

897
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,640
we're counting how many B's we can put

898
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,480
there. And this hypothesis is just a

899
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,440
bound on the number of B's that go

900
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,440
there.

901
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:54,240
So this is less than a squ. Pick any A1

902
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,839
and A2. And then if A1 and A2 obey this

903
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,400
condition, there are at most this many

904
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,400
choices for B.

905
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,880
Okay. Uh, and that's it. I now I should

906
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,040
convert this sum to an average by

907
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:18,680
dividing by b. And what's left is

908
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,680
epsilon kus 2 a^ 2.

909
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,440
Okay.

910
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,000
Okay, great.

911
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So, we are now almost done proving this

912
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,240
lema about paths of length two and I can

913
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,160
fit the rest of it

914
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,559
in the little space under the statement

915
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,559
of the lab.

916
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,920
Okay.

917
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,119
Um

918
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:19,119
okay so on average n of b is pretty big

919
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:22,079
by lama p2 on average n of b is is

920
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,200
bigger than this.

921
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,520
So proof a prime is going to be n of b

922
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,599
for some b

923
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:34,079
and on average um this is kind of true

924
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,440
because of lambda p1.

925
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,440
So we just need to be a little careful

926
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,200
about how exactly to combine these two

927
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:44,960
things. Um, and the way to do it is to

928
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,960
look at the average value of

929
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:52,079
n of b^2

930
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:56,040
minus 1 / 2 epsilon times the number of

931
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,040
bad uh pairs.

932
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,640
Okay. So,

933
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,480
so why do we combine things by taking a

934
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,400
linear combination? We do that because

935
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,160
that's nice because of linearity of

936
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,000
expectation. I can compute this directly

937
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,680
from the two lamas computing these

938
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,119
things individually. So that's why we'd

939
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,640
want to add them. And what do we get?

940
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,440
Well, just plugging in the balance from

941
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:28,119
lama p1 and lama p2, we get that this is

942
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,119
at least 12 kus 2 a^ 2.

943
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,960
Okay. So now I I uh I choose B

944
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:45,280
so that

945
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:48,960
N of B ^ 2 - 1 / 2 epsilon

946
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,599
BPs of B is greater than or equal to its

947
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,440
mean

948
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,440
and I set a prime to be this.

949
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,559
All right. And then I claim we can read

950
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,319
off the two things we care about. The

951
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,680
first thing we care about is that n of b

952
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:07,680
is pretty big. So we can ignore this

953
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,160
negative thing. n of b ^2 is at least

954
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,440
this big. And so n of b is at least

955
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,599
around k inverse a. That is bullet point

956
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,800
one.

957
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,920
And bullet point two is that there are

958
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,599
only a small fraction of bad pairs a1

959
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,359
a2.

960
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:30,880
Well for this thing is positive. So one

961
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:34,400
over this one I'll write down. So we get

962
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,160
the number of bad pairs

963
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,359
is at most bring this over here and

964
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,319
multiply 2 epsilon times the number of

965
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,319
totals total pairs only a two epsilon

966
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,800
fraction of the total pairs are bad.

967
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,800
That's the state.

968
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,760
Okay. Any questions or comments about

969
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,760
about this lema?

970
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:12,880
>> So in the end like all the A's

971
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:15,359
we choose are the neighbors of one B.

972
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:20,920
>> Yeah, that's right. So our set A prime

973
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,920
is just the set of neighbors of one B.

974
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,839
That's right.

975
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,280
Um

976
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,720
yeah you know if you look if maybe at

977
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,040
the end we'll sort of try to look back

978
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,280
over the balac summary dearish theorem

979
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,200
and balar theorems the conclusion is

980
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,920
there exists a prime and b prime so that

981
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,800
a prime plus b prime is small and it's a

982
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,599
natural question like who are a prime

983
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,079
plus b prime how do we find them

984
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,440
um this one I actually probably should

985
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,599
have named something different this is

986
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,000
not the final a prime in the in the end

987
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,240
of balex it's a stepping stone

988
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Uh but we can we keep track of it along

989
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,559
the way and see you know how do we find

990
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,559
a prime and b

991
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,520
yeah

992
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:26,319
okay

993
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,079
so here most of the pairs are good

994
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:31,839
and we're going to upgrade that in a

995
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:35,280
trivial way. If you fix A1, we could ask

996
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,200
whether most of the A2 are good.

997
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,040
And that's not necessarily going to

998
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,599
work. There could be a few bad A1's

999
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:44,480
where most where many A2s are bad, but

1000
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:47,119
we just cross them out and make a prime

1001
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,760
a bit smaller. And and then we could say

1002
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:53,640
for every A1, most of the A2s are good.

1003
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,640
So let me write that down.

1004
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,640
So I think this is the best thing that I

1005
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,640
know how to say about paths of length

1006
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,640
two.

1007
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:20,079
Okay. So let me call this lema 2 for

1008
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,720
positive length two.

1009
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:28,400
So if x is in a cross b size of x is at

1010
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:33,200
least k inverse a b and epsilon is

1011
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:37,280
bigger than zero um then

1012
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:40,880
there exists a2 in a so that it's pretty

1013
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:46,720
big not quite as big as before but I

1014
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:48,880
don't know quarter k inverse a and

1015
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,440
for every

1016
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,160
A and A2

1017
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,799
um a fraction of 1 minus well it won't

1018
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,319
be 1 - 2 epsilon but maybe 1 - 10

1019
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:01,920
epsilon

1020
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:04,319
time A2 uh

1021
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:09,359
of A2

1022
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:13,599
uh or let me let me say it this way

1023
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:16,640
at most tan epsilon times the size of a2

1024
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,640
little a2 and a2

1025
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,760
there are at most theirs

1026
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,760
So that the pair little a1 a2 is epsilon

1027
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,760
bad.

1028
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:38,200
Okay. So um proof sketch is just

1029
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,200
uh use the previous lema

1030
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:46,799
and a2 is a prime take away the a's that

1031
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,119
are that that have too many bad

1032
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,119
neighbors.

1033
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,880
Yeah, actually let me write this in a

1034
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,839
better way and then I can draw the

1035
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:36,240
picture of it. So for every A in our

1036
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:41,480
set, we can break up the set as a bad

1037
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,480
part, giving me a good part.

1038
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,880
Um, and what's good what what's the

1039
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,119
feature of each of these? The bad part

1040
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,119
is small.

1041
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:55,799
And what the what's good about the good

1042
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,799
part

1043
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,359
the good part there are many paths from

1044
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,079
A to A2 in the good part.

1045
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:14,400
>> Yeah.

1046
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:18,200
>> A2 is a

1047
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,200
comma a2. Correct.

1048
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,359
Okay.

1049
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,920
Okay. So, this is our the final word uh

1050
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,760
in today's story about what we can say

1051
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,359
about paths of length two. And now we're

1052
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,880
going to bootstrap that and say

1053
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:43,319
something even better about paths of

1054
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,319
length three, which is the main one.

1055
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,040
All right.

1056
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,640
Now we can prove the key lema. Okay.

1057
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,079
There's a little bit at the at the

1058
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,760
beginning. You know there was one

1059
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,960
example that was mentioned earlier that

1060
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:22,559
there might be a few elements of a that

1061
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,559
are in no edges or in very few edges and

1062
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,319
it's helpful to just eliminate them from

1063
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,040
the beginning. It's easy to reduce to

1064
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:34,960
the case that that doesn't happen. So

1065
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:41,920
step one um so a1 is defined to be the

1066
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:46,079
set of a and a so that um the uh the

1067
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:48,720
number of edges from a a to b let me see

1068
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,599
how I wrote that oh yeah that's just the

1069
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,799
size of the neighborhood of a the size

1070
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:58,240
of the neighborhood of a is at least a

1071
01:00:54,799 --> 01:01:00,079
small fraction of the typical

1072
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,240
This is the this is the average value of

1073
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,880
the size of the neighborhood. We get rid

1074
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:07,599
of the of the guys who have way below

1075
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,559
average number of neighbors. Okay. And

1076
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:16,160
then it's straightforward to check

1077
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:20,319
that. So, so if I write X of

1078
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:24,480
A prime B prime, that's defined to be

1079
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:29,319
the set of pairs AB in A prime cross B

1080
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,319
prime and in X.

1081
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:39,880
So if I take the edges X from A1 to B,

1082
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:39,880
um that is still most of the edges

1083
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:49,040
And um also since I removed a1 comma b

1084
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:51,760
since I removed low density edges now

1085
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:54,160
the typical density has gone up. So this

1086
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,680
is still true.

1087
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,359
Right? So basically without loss of

1088
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,319
generality I can assume that all the

1089
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,319
edges have a decent success.

1090
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,400
All right.

1091
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:20,400
So next

1092
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:24,880
I use lema 2 and it tells me that I have

1093
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:26,720
this set uh a2 in a that has this this

1094
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:30,200
good property and a prime is just going

1095
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,200
to be this a2.

1096
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,599
All right. So here's my a2.

1097
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,760
This is a2.

1098
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:44,960
And maybe there's some more of a up

1099
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:48,400
here. Um, and if I pick a particular A

1100
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,799
in here, then I can break this up into a

1101
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:54,839
small bad part

1102
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:54,839
and a big good part.

1103
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,799
Um, the bad part is small and for the

1104
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,880
good part there are lots of edges to the

1105
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:09,559
good part

1106
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,559
which I'll sort of illustrate like this.

1107
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,280
Okay,

1108
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:24,400
cool.

1109
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:28,240
So now I would like to choose uh

1110
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,839
B. I'd like to choose B prime and B.

1111
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,559
There's some more vertices here. So over

1112
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:34,480
here is B. Who shall I include in B

1113
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,599
prime? And I want to know that I if I

1114
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:42,079
start in any A, I have many paths of

1115
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:43,920
length three to everybody in B prime.

1116
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,760
Okay.

1117
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,319
Now, one thing that's a bit tricky is

1118
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,079
that as I vary A, G of A and B of A

1119
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:53,359
aren't going to change. And I don't know

1120
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:56,319
much about that. Um, but it seems like a

1121
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:59,599
good idea to take vertices B that have a

1122
01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:03,359
lot of edges to A2.

1123
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:06,079
Um, and if vertex B has no edges to A2,

1124
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:07,760
I'm this is not going to be helpful.

1125
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,280
So that's how we're going to define B

1126
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,799
prime.

1127
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:17,520
B prime is the set of B and B with the

1128
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:22,720
property that um the number of edges

1129
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:26,520
from B to A prime is at least 20 epsilon

1130
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,520
times the size of A.

1131
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,240
Okay. Now let's compare that with what

1132
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:36,400
we know about here. We know that the bad

1133
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:38,960
set of a is at most 10 epsilon times the

1134
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:43,079
size of a prime. So the that this was

1135
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,079
selected to be bigger than that.

1136
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:51,119
Okay. So now I can say for every A and A

1137
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,359
prime or B and B prime

1138
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:58,799
the number of paths of length three from

1139
01:04:53,359 --> 01:05:02,799
A to B is at least okay I start in A

1140
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:06,319
then uh for every every good A I can

1141
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:11,039
have a lot of paths to that good A. So

1142
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:14,319
it's at least um that was epsilon k the

1143
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:19,200
minus 2 b that's how many paths I have

1144
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:21,520
to a to a good a times the size of n of

1145
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,760
b

1146
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:27,400
intersected with the good a's the guys

1147
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,400
who are good for a

1148
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:34,480
so if I have if I look at the guys that

1149
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:38,400
are good for a and they neighbor b. So

1150
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:41,440
here's B. This is good for A and they

1151
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,880
neighbor B. Actually, let me do this.

1152
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:48,720
See, this is B. These guys here are good

1153
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,119
for A and they neighbor B. And there are

1154
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:56,480
pretty many paths to each die. That's

1155
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:58,720
good. And then from here I can get to B.

1156
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,359
Okay,

1157
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,559
good. And then this is bigger than

1158
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:06,079
epsilon k the minus 2b

1159
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:09,839
times

1160
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:14,160
um well there are at least 20 epsilon a

1161
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:17,440
prime guys in n of b intersected a let's

1162
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:23,000
do this one n of b intersected a prime

1163
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,000
minus uh the number of bags

1164
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,839
and then this whole thing is at least 10

1165
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,839
epsilon the size

1166
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:38,000
Okay, so the key point is that I'm

1167
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,319
looking at B's that have a lot of edges

1168
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,480
to A prime, many more than the size of

1169
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:45,520
the bad set. So there are still lots of

1170
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:49,039
edges that go to the good set.

1171
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:53,520
Okay. Um, so I put this together. This

1172
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:56,559
is like epsilon^ 2 k the minus2

1173
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,480
a. So a a prime is also about the size

1174
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:04,039
of a.

1175
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,039
A prime is greater than k inverse a

1176
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,119
something like this.

1177
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:18,559
Okay. So um we're we are not done yet.

1178
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,799
Uh because we haven't proven that b

1179
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,640
prime uh we haven't proven that it's not

1180
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,839
empty. We need to prove that it's pretty

1181
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:29,359
big.

1182
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:31,039
Um but um uh but okay but for each a and

1183
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,559
a prime and b and b prime we do have a

1184
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,559
lot of edges. We do have the right

1185
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,640
number of edges. We also have to choose

1186
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:39,760
epsilon but as long as I choose epsilon

1187
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,839
to be one over a power of k that will be

1188
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,240
uh that will fit the bill of of what

1189
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:45,240
we're trying to prove.

1190
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,880
Okay, so the last thing is to check that

1191
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,160
B prime is pretty big or a little more

1192
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,920
carefully to check that there are still

1193
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,920
a lot of edges between A prime and B

1194
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,920
prime.

1195
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,400
All right.

1196
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,040
Okay.

1197
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:52,239
Okay. So last step

1198
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:55,120
we have to check

1199
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:59,759
that the number of edges from A prime to

1200
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:03,120
B prime is at least K the minus O1* the

1201
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:05,040
original number of edges.

1202
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,520
Or you could put times AB but those are

1203
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:10,560
the same.

1204
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:15,199
All right. So remember we proved earlier

1205
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,960
that a prime is at least around 1 / k *

1206
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:21,319
a

1207
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,319
um and um

1208
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:28,799
right and we also know so why did we do

1209
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:32,880
this pruning at the beginning?

1210
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:37,600
Um a prime is contained in a1. We did

1211
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:39,520
this initial pruning. So n a is greater

1212
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,679
than

1213
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:46,239
um

1214
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:51,359
is greater than 110th k inverse b for

1215
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:53,040
every a in a prime which is an animal.

1216
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,159
They're all pretty big. So there are

1217
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:58,320
lots of edges that leave a prime. So the

1218
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,480
number of edges between a prime and all

1219
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,840
of b

1220
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:06,840
that's at least k the minus2

1221
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,840
a.

1222
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:19,120
Okay. Now to make b prime b prime are

1223
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:21,760
the guys that have pretty many edges to

1224
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,600
a prime. So we're going to cross out the

1225
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,239
guys that have very few edges to a

1226
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:29,679
prime.

1227
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:33,560
So if I count edges from A prime to B

1228
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,560
take away B prime.

1229
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,800
So these each one of these has only 20

1230
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:42,080
epsilon edges to A prime. So that's at

1231
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:48,199
most 20 epsilon sorry 20 epsilon A prime

1232
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:48,199
edges time B time B.

1233
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:55,600
So that's less than 20 epsilon A.

1234
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,600
Okay, now we have paused about when to

1235
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,840
choose epsilon. We need it to be at

1236
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:03,440
least some small power some kus of 1.

1237
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,400
But we can make it small enough that

1238
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,440
this is way bigger than this.

1239
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:14,560
So we choose we now choose epsilon to be

1240
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:16,480
say 1 million * kus 2. And what that

1241
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,280
tells us is that the number of edges

1242
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,719
from a prime to the complement of b

1243
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:28,239
prime is way smaller than the number of

1244
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:30,000
edges from a a prime to b.

1245
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:32,800
So the conclusion is that the number of

1246
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,440
edges from a prime to b prime is about

1247
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,120
the same as the number of edges from a

1248
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:42,560
prime to b which is at least k the minus

1249
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,719
o of 1 a.

1250
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,000
So we have checked the last thing. We

1251
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,000
still have a lot of edges.

1252
01:11:53,440 --> 01:12:01,000
Okay. Do people have any uh last

1253
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,000
questions or comments about this proof?

1254
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:15,520
Okay. I have some last picture questions

1255
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:18,239
or comments about this proof. Um, uh,

1256
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,640
okay. So, this proof is not that hard,

1257
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:23,280
but it you're not that long, but it's

1258
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,640
clever, and it came as I I think it came

1259
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:29,440
as a surprise to people, and it

1260
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:32,000
certainly is surprising to me. Um, so

1261
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:36,239
first of all, we have this problem about

1262
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,400
additive combinotaurics. Um and

1263
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:40,159
there are different tools like like like

1264
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,640
for analysis is very well suited to

1265
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,920
additive combinotaurics. So it's sort of

1266
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,880
it's sort of something about you can

1267
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,880
think of it as something about

1268
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,560
convolutions.

1269
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:53,120
Um and um for analysis doesn't seem to

1270
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:57,440
help much to prove this thing

1271
01:12:53,120 --> 01:13:00,320
and um okay and then we have this graph

1272
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:04,400
you know this graph is like

1273
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:06,640
you you think of it as an adjacy matrix

1274
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:10,960
and if you want to count paths from a1

1275
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:13,760
to a2 you've taken um

1276
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,000
uh so the adjacy matrix is a we took a a

1277
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,679
star if you want to take paths of length

1278
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,840
three it's A a star A.

1279
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,840
So this is a theorem about powers of a

1280
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,440
matrix. So you might think that linear

1281
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,120
algebra would be helpful to prove this

1282
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,560
theorem.

1283
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,640
I thought about that. I couldn't figure

1284
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,760
it as far as I could totally be missing

1285
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,280
something, but as far as I can see,

1286
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,719
linear algebra is not helpful to prove

1287
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,040
this theorem about the powers of a

1288
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,000
matrix.

1289
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:42,080
Um and on the other hand this uh sort of

1290
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,679
elementary double counting clever but

1291
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,520
elementary double counting and graph

1292
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:50,520
theory uh really makes it you know

1293
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,520
works.

1294
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,400
So that's something that I find rather

1295
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,400
surprising.

1296
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,800
Okay. Um I mentioned last time that this

1297
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:07,840
this theorem is really used a lot is

1298
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,880
worth knowing about um uh is is

1299
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,159
important and um so hopefully you've

1300
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,520
seen a little bit of that but as the

1301
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:16,080
class goes on actually we might have

1302
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,400
some more time to comment on how this

1303
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:20,080
bal theorem when I first saw it it

1304
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,480
seemed a little bit technical like

1305
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,480
there's like two very s two ra at first

1306
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,840
rather similar sounding ways of a set of

1307
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:30,400
having additive structure and they're

1308
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:33,040
related to each other um but Um uh but

1309
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:36,000
this is this is extremely useful uh and

1310
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,280
important thing and um yeah I well we

1311
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,600
talked about it but we'll we'll keep

1312
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,600
talking about it.
