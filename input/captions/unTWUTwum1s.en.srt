1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,960
okay

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,880
welcome so this is

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,880
243 I hope you're in the right

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,199
place

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,439
um okay my name is Johan Pao

6
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,680
Beretta and

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,399
um I am very very happy to teach this

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,520
course it's as you know it's the first

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,320
time

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,320
um this

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,760
spring although this course been taught

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,559
very similar in poly Technic of Milano

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,039
for

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:56,000
about maybe 12

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:01:01,920
years um for the first year um PhD

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,920
students in energy in the energy program

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,320
so I'm using view graphs that I've

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,680
developed over the

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,960
years in fact this is a very particular

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,080
year for thermodynamics as you know it's

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,080
the 200 uh uh

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,560
birthday and

23
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,880
I I like to

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,680
say that

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,240
um right

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,920
now I I am uh I reached onethird of the

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,479
age of

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,280
thermodynamics when I started studying

29
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,040
it uh

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,799
1978 it was

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:49,960
17th

32
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,840
so uh it's my entire uh academic career

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:57,680
has been around

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,320
this of course carau is only one of many

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,039
who have contributed

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:09,920
over the two centu term Dynamics like

37
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:11,120
carau Jew ranking elol Claus Kelvin m v

sommerfield Kate odor Einstein Kenan and

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,840
I say a few words more about him FY

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,440
gugenheim onager Zigler the gr pin

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
mazour atopos

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,680
and

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:42,319
PRS and I apologize for those

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:46,040
who I I I haven't uh written uh down

47
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:50,959
there actually may notice that the only

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,440
person currently alive is U John

49
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,879
prit but he deserves I believe a place

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,280
there anyway for he deserved it for a

51
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,239
long time uh

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,040
now the reason I'm

53
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,599
U

54
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,599
particularly happy about teaching this

55
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,519
course

56
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:15,519
here it uh goes back to Kenan and

57
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,519
atopos

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:25,200
um I like to reference them I mean Kenan

59
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,200
atopos but also the late professor

60
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,720
gios

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,720
uh sorry

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,799
as the Kenan

63
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,560
School of of

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,519
thermodynamics

65
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:51,120
because Kenan who by the way was uh uh

66
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,920
using the office downstairs in 3-

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,879
339 as we also did me atopos for a few

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,720
years and me for just uh five years when

69
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,159
I was young uh we used the same room so

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,040
that was a privilege for

71
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:13,200
me uh as you see these are the

72
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,799
books uh that have characterized this uh

73
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,519
School of uh teaching from Dynamics you

74
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,919
will see it's kind of different from the

75
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,040
traditional

76
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:30,280
Exposition uh I like to say more General

77
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:34,600
and more uh free of uh uh vicious

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:38,080
logical Loops that are typical of

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,080
theistic presentations of

80
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,160
thermodynamics Professor

81
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,560
gpos has been

82
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,720
teaching this course or maybe the course

83
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,479
that now has become

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,800
242 uh it used to be called

85
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,759
2451 he thought that for about 20 or

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,160
maybe 25 years

87
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,560
and I helped him uh during those years

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,039
and then we came up with this book this

89
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,080
book uh uh is uh in the background of uh

90
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,479
what we will we will do

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,120
here uh only in the background not that

92
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,720
we are going to cover the book but it

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,680
helps me a lot the the fact that uh when

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,479
in class I would say you can prove or it

95
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,000
can be proved you can find the proofs

96
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,600
all in all details in that book which is

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,039
uh I mean

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,160
very good for my from my point of view

99
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,360
because I don't need to spend time

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,160
repeating the proofs except only very

101
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,880
few fundamental ones and easy

102
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,120
ones uh but you can find them there and

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,560
if you are uh very fond of the subject

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,120
you want to go deep you you may study it

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,840
there and you may come and discuss uh

106
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:03,560
them uh uh my office anytime you want

107
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,639
actually my office hours are anytime uh

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,639
uh either by a pointer or just drop by

109
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,800
most of the times all the time I'll will

110
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,479
be in the office working so um you can

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,560
come or call

112
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:24,199
anytime if you want we can set up also

113
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:28,319
more official uh uh office

114
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,919
hours um now the objective of this

115
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,840
course

116
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:36,240
uh is not

117
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,080
applications because I presume that the

118
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,520
applications have been seen already in

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,039
previous courses that you've been

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:49,960
exposed to or maybe in your uh doctoral

121
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:53,800
or Master's thesis

122
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:58,840
work what I want to put the emphasis on

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:03,039
is a broad perspective on uh the

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,560
assumptions that are uh needed to make

125
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,639
or that are behind certain

126
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,199
models standard

127
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:14,319
models little nonstandard models uh

128
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,960
models that uh you use

129
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,160
in uh physics and in

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,560
engineering because thermodynamics as

131
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:28,039
you know uh uh covers

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,720
applications in an enormous amount of

133
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,479
fields so no no body can really say I

134
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,639
know all applications of

135
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:40,400
thermodynamics they they're essentially

136
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,280
infinite the good thing since we are in

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
an engineering department is that as you

138
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,960
know carau was an engineer

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,800
thermodynamics started from

140
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,520
engineering and then it was picked up by

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,879
physicists and so it goes back and forth

142
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,879
so we share uh the subject we we

143
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,919
Engineers share the subject the subject

144
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,400
with the physicist and the physicist

145
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,479
share it with Engineers not only

146
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,840
engineer I mean all kinds of engineering

147
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,599
so including chemistry chemical

148
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,280
engineering is very strong in very

149
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,919
strong uh

150
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,919
history and DEP about

151
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:24,720
thermodynamics now the emphasis of of

152
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:29,639
the course is on non

153
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,880
equilibrium uh until when I did my PhD

154
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,640
studies here uh

155
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,320
thermodynamics in those times was

156
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,680
considered a dead

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,959
subject because everybody was thinking

158
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:49,160
with thermodynamics is just

159
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:54,279
equilibrium um and in fact that was a

160
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:58,200
um for a still uh few years later maybe

161
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:01,600
in the the late

162
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,800
90s that uh there's been

163
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,360
a Revival of thermodynamics because of

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,839
non equilibrium because of ir reversible

165
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,200
processes now and also because of

166
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,200
quantum

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:20,920
thermodynamics now it is a an enormous

168
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,720
field Quantum thermodynamics in those

169
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,720
times it was considered

170
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,040
useless and asopos andos

171
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,440
in my opinion are the true pioneers of

172
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,959
of that subject even though there since

173
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,000
their point of view was not

174
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:46,320
standard uh they're not so recognized

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,920
not everywhere as

176
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:55,519
Pioneers but if you read the recent U uh

177
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,959
paper in science or scientific America

178
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,320
uh about Quantum Dynamics I think it's

179
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:05,760
called Quantum Ste te Punk um who was

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,959
written by uh by the way the winner of a

181
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,800
of the of a prein price in

182
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,240
thermodynamics

183
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,320
uh which I happen to be involved with uh

184
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,959
uh well she wrote this book steampunk

185
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,680
Quantum thermodynamics and also this

186
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,160
science article where she does recognize

187
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:31,720
the roles of atopos and

188
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,360
gios uh so the course is three parts one

189
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,200
the first part is the review of the

190
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,240
basic concepts and definitions but with

191
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,399
this emphasis on non

192
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,040
equilibrium uh especially on the

193
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,519
definition of entropy for non

194
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,200
equilibrium States and in particular uh

195
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:52,079
we will see an interesting U aspect of

196
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,240
what uh heat interaction is and the

197
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,639
generalization of the concept of heat

198
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,639
interaction that is useful for

199
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,880
describing the uh non states of continum

200
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,880
like

201
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,880
fluids the second

202
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:16,800
part which is focused on U chemical

203
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,800
potentials or electrochemical

204
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,160
potentials uh so multicomponent systems

205
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,959
and the role that chemical potentials U

206
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,399
have in describing

207
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:33,440
them so I'm not reading all these typ

208
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,760
and the the last part the last third of

209
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,120
the course

210
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:42,959
is more explicitly on the standard

211
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,120
theories of non-equilibrium like uh

212
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:50,720
particular the role of reciprocal

213
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,279
relations and uh the again

214
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,639
the the assumptions that are needed to

215
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,920
describe these states which are non

216
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,160
equilibrium and how they evolve in time

217
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,839
and um how

218
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,800
you

219
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,200
relate uh the entropy production by

220
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,160
irreversibility to the various fluxes

221
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,160
and forces in

222
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,160
play

223
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:23,760
so yeah this is about the grading uh

224
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:26,720
policy there will be um

225
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,800
a everything is going to be oral the

226
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,120
emphasis the reason why this is very

227
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,720
unusual ual it May Scare some of

228
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,160
you if if it does scare you and you

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,680
still have to take the

230
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,320
qualifiers uh consider it as a practice

231
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,839
for for that purpose

232
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,199
um if you are instead

233
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,240
uh pass that and you are aiming to a

234
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,639
career in academics where you might have

235
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,800
a

236
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,399
chance that your duty among your duties

237
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,600
you have to teach the subject which is

238
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,639
typical if you go to mechanical

239
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,199
engineering department typically nobody

240
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,079
wants to teach thermodynamics so they if

241
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,360
you're the new one you do it until

242
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,279
somebody else

243
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,000
comes uh

244
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,720
Well I this is the reason why I provide

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,600
the viewrs I provide the

246
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,320
videos uh so I want to make it easy for

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:30,079
you if you want to teach it this way

248
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:33,920
because it's already done okay um

249
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:38,199
and I'm very happy uh to share uh all

250
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,800
this because as as I said uh this is my

251
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,800
uh life

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,519
subject so there will be um one homework

253
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,040
and uh four midterms essentially there

254
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,560
so five items that you have to do they

255
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,440
are all take

256
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,160
home uh as soon as as and they are all

257
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,040
of the kind that you are give you one or

258
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,759
two VI graphs of the ones that I use in

259
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,480
class and you have to repeat in your own

260
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:15,199
way in front of a camera no more than

261
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,399
five minutes uh the words that go in

262
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,399
between the equations that or the the

263
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,720
things that are written on the uh on The

264
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:26,560
View graphs so that's essentially a

265
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,240
short lecture uh that you give on that

266
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,000
subject following using the you can use

267
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,240
uh you can use the videos you can use

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
whatever you want to to to do them so I

269
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,399
would consider those

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,399
easy uh so you shouldn't be concerned

271
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,399
about grades that you get out of this

272
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,199
course and yes there is also a final

273
00:14:51,639 --> 00:15:00,120
exam which is also oral that's oral in

274
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:05,000
presence it lasts 30 minutes

275
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:09,160
uh and also for that uh um it's the same

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,600
idea I I tell you take the view graph on

277
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,839
say chemical

278
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,440
equilibrium and talk about it so you

279
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,920
don't have to memorize anything you you

280
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,639
have the view graphs you can also take

281
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,320
your own U hand notes or your whatever

282
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:27,600
you want uh as long as you don't come

283
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,560
without anything and you waste all the

284
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,519
30 minutes trying to write a couple of

285
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,519
the formulas you remember because that's

286
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,240
I consider a waste of time it doesn't

287
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:41,759
allow me to uh check that you have tried

288
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:45,519
to go uh over uh all of the things that

289
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:50,000
we have covered the actually the

290
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,000
um the final is going to cover only the

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,120
second and third

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,279
part uh of of of the of the

293
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,920
course uh okay so

294
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,800
let's get

295
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,720
started

296
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,000
thermodynamics so what's

297
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,040
thermodynamics do any of you have an

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,480
idea

299
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,480
of what what's the definition of

300
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
thermodynamics don't be scared I

301
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,920
mean no you're shy

302
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,959
yeah okay that that's

303
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,959
two I

304
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:53,639
would anything anything more like

305
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,480
General how you use you you use

306
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,839
thermodynamics in your uh in your

307
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,839
research what do you use it for

308
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:09,039
maybe you do molecular Dynamic

309
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:12,280
simulations that's a way to compute

310
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,280
properties of

311
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,120
stuff in

312
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,559
fact

313
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,600
yeah heat and work are

314
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:26,360
certainly peculiar

315
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:30,039
um kinds of interactions that occur that

316
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,160
are described in thermodynamics

317
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,559
but in general thermodynamics is

318
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,120
a is a subject where you say let me use

319
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,400
words that I haven't defined yet but uh

320
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:48,280
it's a subject that um

321
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,919
um allows you to compute properties of

322
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,640
physical

323
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,799
systems and see how they change with

324
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,280
time and how they are maybe transferred

325
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,840
from one system to the other like by

326
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,840
means of heat and War

327
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,600
all right so

328
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,520
system

329
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,039
property state of the

330
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,200
system also the word

331
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:19,840
process okay so this is why I want to

332
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:23,679
spend some time in uh

333
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,720
defining these things these words

334
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,000
because these

335
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,960
words are loaded of meaning

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,159
and

337
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:38,760
therefore uh represent

338
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:41,520
restrictions uh within the theory of

339
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,280
thermodynamics actually thermodynamics

340
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,600
is

341
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,679
really modeling you want to model

342
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,679
physical

343
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,679
reality exactly like

344
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,760
physics or or mechanics uh does some

345
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:02,559
modeling of certain aspects it's also uh

346
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,200
similar

347
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:09,880
um so the key word is

348
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,000
modeling you want to describe

349
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,360
a a glass of water a bottle of water the

350
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,039
water in a bottle

351
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:26,080
and uh you make a model you typically

352
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:28,200
simplifying the situation to make it

353
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,240
contain enough of what you need to

354
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:36,400
describe that water but nothing

355
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:40,679
more so sometimes this system this will

356
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:45,240
be a system the water inside this

357
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:48,840
container and uh uh this system is

358
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:53,240
interacting with the air that surrounds

359
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:56,520
it so you need to consider both the

360
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,520
water and the

361
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,080
surroundings but most of the times you

362
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,720
don't need to consider what happens in

363
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,559
say the corridor of your lab or what

364
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,799
happens where is the moon right now so

365
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:17,240
you can simplify by

366
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,000
removing unnecessary aspects of your

367
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,200
physical reality and

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,600
concentrating on what you really want to

369
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,600
represent uh and also you want

370
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,600
to simplify

371
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:39,200
so uh as you know I can describe water

372
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:43,080
as if uh it's composed of molecules and

373
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:47,679
molecules can be considered for certain

374
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,840
aspects um like

375
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,640
U

376
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,400
indivisible like atoms in the democratus

377
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,240
sense no you cannot split them but if

378
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,640
you're interested in uh

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,960
chemistry well then the molecule can be

380
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,760
split and then the building blocks are

381
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,880
the

382
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,760
atoms or if you're interested in uh

383
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,640
nuclear uh

384
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,200
phenomena they building blocks and not

385
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,200
even the atoms there are the protons the

386
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,279
neutrons the

387
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,039
electrons if can even go to lower level

388
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:30,400
description it can go to quarks and the

389
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:33,240
quarks can be split into Maybe spring uh

390
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,960
string theories and things like that all

391
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:41,120
right so who knows uh if there is a a

392
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:45,279
bottom level of description for things

393
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:49,720
but not for every model you need to go

394
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:53,000
that deep you just use whatever is

395
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,240
necessary for enough for the phenomena

396
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,880
you want to describe so that's the let's

397
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,799
call it art of modeling

398
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,799
to get rid of the

399
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:12,159
unnecessary so usually a system uh we we

400
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,640
agree and we understand that is made up

401
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,919
physical systems made made up of

402
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,080
constituents that could be the molecules

403
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:25,520
the atoms the nuclei the the protons the

404
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,600
nucleons uh and so on depending on the

405
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,440
level of description you choose

406
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,320
then you so you set up this bunch of

407
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,279
molecules which are the ingredients of

408
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:43,559
your object of study that's not yet a

409
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:45,720
system you have to explain or describe

410
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,080
how they interact with each other for

411
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,240
example in a molecular Dynamic

412
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:54,760
simulation you want to describe uh what

413
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:58,760
kind of potential uh like ler Johns our

414
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:01,640
spheres uh soft spheres and things like

415
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:07,360
that okay so these are

416
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:10,200
uh um internal forces between the

417
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,799
constituents of your

418
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,880
system and then you also have to um

419
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,000
because most of the times your system is

420
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,720
confined for example the air in this

421
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,720
room is confined by the walls or the

422
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,679
water here is confined by the bottle and

423
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:31,960
uh so you want to uh describe uh also

424
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:35,559
the what I would call the external

425
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,640
forces as something

426
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:41,760
that puts in the model the effect of the

427
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,559
walls but these effect external forces

428
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:49,200
must be particularly

429
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:53,840
simple and there it's written that

430
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:57,000
you should U the those forces should not

431
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,200
depend on the coordinates of

432
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,480
constituents that are not

433
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,840
the constituents of your

434
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,880
system so what does that mean for

435
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,760
example the walls yes the walls are made

436
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:14,400
of molecules so when I

437
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:19,080
have a molecule of oxygen that goes and

438
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,000
hits the wall and it bounces back uh

439
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,279
what affects that

440
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,880
bouncing is certainly the molecules of

441
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:31,600
the W okay but you don't

442
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,080
need

443
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,720
to uh describe to include the the

444
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,919
molecules of the W in your model unless

445
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:46,840
you're interested in the effects also of

446
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,720
what happens inside the wall you could

447
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,960
just describe that as a like

448
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,720
a mirror bouncing or in elastic bouncing

449
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,039
or in elastic bouncing can Define rules

450
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:04,320
of how the walls behave when particles

451
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:07,039
go uh and uh go and uh hit

452
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,559
them uh so these

453
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,840
rules may depend on some control

454
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:16,039
parameters for example where the wall is

455
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,640
you could have a classical piston on you

456
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:22,360
can move a wall okay so and so you

457
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,520
control the position of the wall you

458
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,919
could also

459
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,799
control

460
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:33,600
um other with other parameters what the

461
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:39,200
worldall does to your particles okay as

462
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:44,240
long as it that effect is not um

463
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:49,200
dependent on within your model of uh

464
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,200
the coordinates of those uh

465
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,679
particles so if the external forces are

466
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,080
of this

467
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:00,360
kind then we can call it a

468
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,399
system and here is a counter example for

469
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:08,000
example suppose I have a hydrogen

470
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:09,559
atom with a proton and an electron and

471
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,200
we all know that

472
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:18,360
electrostatics Mak such that the the

473
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,360
force uh um sorry for

474
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,960
Interruption so the force between proton

475
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,440
and electron depends on the relative

476
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,320
distance of of of between the

477
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,880
two and

478
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:40,640
so if I have an electron which is bound

479
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,039
in an atom and I want to consider it as

480
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,960
my system I

481
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,480
cannot that cannot be a system

482
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,840
because the for the external Force

483
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,960
depends on the

484
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,279
coordinates of the

485
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,559
proton so if you want to consider that

486
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,320
situation you have to INE include the

487
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,880
proton in your

488
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:08,000
system or you have

489
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:12,520
to or you can only do it if the electron

490
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,640
is in a situation where the effect of

491
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,120
the proton is independent of the

492
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,120
relative

493
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,120
position those are very

494
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:25,840
few except if the electron is very far

495
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:32,159
away from the proton so like is a free

496
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,159
particle Okay so the word system is

497
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:41,159
loaded and as I said uh most of the

498
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,559
times you need your system which is

499
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,960
confined by say the walls according to

500
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,760
those rules and also you need another

501
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:53,279
system to be outside which is capable of

502
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,679
interacting with it for example uh

503
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,880
usually we call that the environment of

504
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,880
the system

505
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,200
which in principle is the rest of the

506
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,679
universe but in practice is that little

507
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,960
part of the rest of the universe that is

508
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,960
relevant to your uh

509
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,880
application okay so once we have defined

510
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,519
the word system we said well we want to

511
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,679
study the properties so how do we study

512
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,760
properties well we go to the lab and we

513
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,440
do

514
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,320
measurements those are are called in

515
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,159
general physical observables the things

516
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,760
that you can measure are physical

517
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:40,799
observables and they correspond to

518
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,960
measurement procedures so uh recipes

519
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:47,080
that you apply in a

520
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,600
lab uh that you should be able to apply

521
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,159
in any lab so the given recipes should

522
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:57,080
not be lab dependent otherwise it

523
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,120
gives something that is not um feature

524
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,120
of your system it's a feature of your

525
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,039
system in your lab so the lab is part of

526
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,480
your

527
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:10,039
system okay but it's that's not enough

528
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,600
not all physical

529
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,760
observables can be called

530
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,279
properties in order for them to be

531
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:22,039
called properties you need the result or

532
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:25,519
the outcome of the measurement to be

533
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:29,440
dependent again within your model on a

534
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,440
single instant of time

535
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:38,000
so take this example a point Mass

536
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,320
particle that moves along the

537
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,640
trajectory so yes if you take two

538
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,679
instance of time T1 and T2 and measure

539
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,360
with a stick the

540
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:53,600
distance uh between those two

541
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,760
points that's certainly a physical

542
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,399
observable you measure it there is a

543
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,799
measuring procedure take the stick and

544
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,960
measure it but it depends on two times

545
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,240
it's not a

546
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,320
property even if you divide it by the

547
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,440
time interval between those two instants

548
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,760
uh you get a ratio which looks like a

549
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,000
you would call it the average uh travel

550
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,760
travel distance but that's again not a

551
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,880
property because it depends on both T1

552
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,880
and

553
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,000
T2 instead we all know that if you take

554
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,960
the limit of T2 go going to T1 and

555
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,519
measured only for a short uh uh distance

556
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,200
that same ratio that one tends to a

557
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,720
property that we call the velocity so

558
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,120
that is a property and it it is assigned

559
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:48,440
to the time T1 to the single uh time

560
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,519
interval so this is what we mean by

561
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,519
properties and properties there are many

562
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:56,639
properties that you can uh uh

563
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,960
describe and that they are defined by

564
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,600
the various measurement process

565
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,440
procedures that you can devise in order

566
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,440
to stud to study your

567
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:10,080
system uh for

568
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,880
example if this is my system I could

569
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,840
count how many molecules are in there so

570
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,960
counting is a good maybe difficult but

571
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,080
it's a well defined uh measurement

572
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,039
procedure so I can count how many

573
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,679
molecules and if there is not only water

574
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,840
but maybe there is also carbon dioxide I

575
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,559
should count how many water molecules

576
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:36,399
and how many carbon dioxide maybe some

577
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:39,760
oxygen some nitrogen uh all right then I

578
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,960
can also measure

579
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,320
if my system is um variable volume not

580
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,080
this bottle but if if this is a variable

581
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,919
volume uh

582
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:56,120
container um then I can also measure the

583
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,120
volume at a given instant of time right

584
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,840
so that's another it's not really

585
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,000
property because it's the value of one

586
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,320
of those that we would call the

587
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,679
parameters of the external that

588
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:12,039
characterize the external

589
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:14,960
forces and these parameters yes for a

590
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,880
lot of um situations in which you want

591
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:23,840
to study properties of

592
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:26,519
substances volume is the main and only

593
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:31,600
parameter but

594
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:34,639
uh as you go especially for small

595
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,320
systems that's not true anymore so the

596
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:41,799
shape of your container

597
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,799
matters we will see we more about this

598
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:49,120
uh so for example if you want to

599
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:52,000
describe the geometry of this um room uh

600
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,240
you need many parameters this is it is

601
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,720
just a box it would be L1 L2 L3 but if

602
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,639
you consider all the detail

603
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,360
uh like there is a there is a there is a

604
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:06,840
corner there you got tables how many

605
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,880
parameters you need you need a lot of

606
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,880
parameters and they all count for some

607
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:20,519
properties but maybe not so these are

608
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:24,159
still just the

609
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:26,480
parameters at that instant of time and

610
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,480
then you can start measuring uh

611
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,480
properties

612
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:38,440
properties depend on um the model you

613
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,919
are considering for example

614
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,480
suppose um suppose I consider a the

615
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:49,880
simplest

616
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:53,480
uh mechanic classical mechanical uh uh

617
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,600
system a particle a single particle in a

618
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,120
box and let's make this box one

619
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,360
dimension so it's even simpler just it

620
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,600
can move back and forth between as X

621
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,679
goes from Zer to

622
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:13,000
L

623
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,480
okay okay so this is a your particle a

624
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,280
point

625
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:22,359
mass m you have to specify M so it's a

626
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,520
parameter of your uh of your system the

627
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,960
number of

628
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,679
particles uh at times T well it's equal

629
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:35,000
to one it's just one particle at any

630
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:38,960
time so it's a constant also

631
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,560
m is just m at any

632
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,320
time what else can I measure well I can

633
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,320
measure where the particle is so that's

634
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:52,679
X that may

635
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:57,839
change so that's a variable

636
00:34:52,679 --> 00:35:02,240
property I can also uh measure x dot

637
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,760
the rate of change like we did there for

638
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,480
velocity okay so it turns out as you

639
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,480
know

640
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,480
that these two essentially or their

641
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,160
equivalent position and

642
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,920
momentum uh are the independent

643
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,680
properties if you measure

644
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,240
those with those measurement results you

645
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,240
can compute all other properties of that

646
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,240
system

647
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:39,680
uh so the list of properties this P1 P2

648
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:43,200
dot dot um is typically

649
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,000
infinite why well because uh even for

650
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,839
this simple system if I know X may I

651
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,200
maybe I want to compute X squar or X

652
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,000
cubed or x to the n and n can be

653
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,319
anything so uh I have an infinite number

654
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,960
of properties

655
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,599
but I could shorten the list by just

656
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:09,240
using the independent ones or a set of

657
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:12,920
independent ones okay so let's say that

658
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,760
these in this list are the independent

659
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:19,680
ones those that are strictly needed in

660
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:23,480
order to compute all the other

661
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,640
properties all right so if you know at

662
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,119
one instant of time T all these numbers

663
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,319
because each one of them is a number so

664
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,359
if you have that list of numbers there

665
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:37,319
is nothing else you can say or you can

666
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:40,359
measure about your system at that

667
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:43,880
instant of time there's no other

668
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:47,160
property so that thing fixes all the

669
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,000
properties that is what we call State so

670
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:54,119
the state of a system is a list of

671
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,680
numbers from which you can compute uh

672
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,520
all its properties at one instant of

673
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,520
time

674
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,880
the same

675
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,560
system let's make

676
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:16,640
it here in another theory for example

677
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,440
not for example another important theory

678
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,040
is quantum

679
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,640
mechanics and then you know that quantum

680
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,079
mechanics the story is a bit uh more

681
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,880
complicated

682
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,560
because uh for example example if you

683
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,560
want to measure

684
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,599
position um cannot really talk about or

685
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,160
you're not completely allowed to think

686
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,960
of the particle adding position until

687
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,560
you measure if you ask the particle

688
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,480
where are you so you make a measurement

689
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,560
uh a measurement act for position the

690
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,560
particle is compelled to give you an

691
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,319
answer so it will answer yes and here

692
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,319
but you cannot

693
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:03,880
um infer from that single act of

694
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:07,680
measurement that the next time you have

695
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,760
the same system in the same state if you

696
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,440
perform a measurement act the particle

697
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,280
give you the same answer all you can

698
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,280
predict is the probability all you can

699
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,800
represent is the probability to get an

700
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,319
answer so the so uh if the probability

701
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,160
to have the particle between X and X

702
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,800
Plus

703
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:34,000
DX and the probability is the this the

704
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:37,400
area here of this curve and this curve

705
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,920
uh is obtain like

706
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:45,720
the the it's the wave function modulus

707
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:49,040
squared something like

708
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,040
that times

709
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,960
DX okay so that's the probability

710
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,440
density uh

711
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,440
and okay

712
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,839
so for this

713
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,960
particularly

714
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:11,599
simple uh quantum mechanical

715
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,040
System since you need a function in

716
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,280
order to describe the

717
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,160
probabilities um a function is an

718
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,160
infinite set of

719
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,040
numbers because it has a value here

720
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,040
there's another value here and another

721
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,560
there so this is an infinite set of

722
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,440
numbers so this is a system which has an

723
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:39,880
infinite number of independent

724
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,359
properties which are though U thanks to

725
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,480
mathematics expressible in terms of a

726
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:48,000
single

727
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,240
function in more complicated situations

728
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,280
uh the function is not the wave function

729
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:58,040
and is called the the density

730
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:01,640
operator but uh still it's a

731
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,480
mathematical object that contains all

732
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:09,160
the probabilities of measurement Act of

733
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:13,079
any uh physical observable that

734
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,240
qualifies as a property so having raow

735
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,800
of

736
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:23,359
t u gives you allows you to compute the

737
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:27,000
values of all uh uh properties for a for

738
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,000
a Quantum system

739
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,920
okay so that's the word

740
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,079
State usually one says

741
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:44,319
in

742
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,760
in Easy exp exposition of thermodynamics

743
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,240
one says well the state of the system is

744
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,760
it condition at a given instant of time

745
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,680
okay that's what we mean by Condition

746
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,160
it's a list of numbers all the values of

747
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,160
all the properties

748
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:04,920
the next stage is that if I want if I

749
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,800
know the state of a system and actually

750
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,800
here I'm going to use the letter

751
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:17,079
A to represent um uh okay we use it for

752
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,359
several

753
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:23,520
purposes the Box typically represents

754
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:25,280
the idea of system and a is the name of

755
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,240
the

756
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,599
system a sub one

757
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:36,040
it's

758
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:39,680
really a at time T1 so a sub one is

759
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,480
defined as uh the list of all the

760
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,480
properties at the given instant of time

761
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,480
T1 that's just for short

762
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,319
end so if I know now the state I want to

763
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:59,040
see how the state evolves in

764
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:01,000
time and the state

765
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,760
namely the

766
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,079
properties can change in

767
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,680
time uh by many reasons due to many uh

768
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,440
uh phenomena some of them are related to

769
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,280
the effect of internal

770
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,359
forces like particles in a box that

771
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:25,040
would Collide and the effect of a

772
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:25,040
collision uh makes their positions

773
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,400
change uh

774
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,960
they are due they may be due also to the

775
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:38,920
external forces collision with the

776
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:41,760
wall or change of the position of a

777
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:46,040
wall

778
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,680
okay so somehow you could uh say that if

779
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,800
you're

780
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,000
not playing around with the parameters

781
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,319
of the system changing the walls uh or

782
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,240
moving the walls uh and what happens is

783
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:03,079
just due to the internal forces uh you

784
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,200
call that internal Dynamics you call it

785
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,760
a spontaneous

786
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,200
process within the system it happens all

787
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,200
within the

788
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,559
system if

789
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:20,359
instead the the change of your state so

790
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:24,280
the change of the properties is due to

791
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:26,319
uh either what uh to what you do to the

792
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,480
to the walls to the moving of the

793
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,400
parameters

794
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:35,920
or to what happens uh on the outside of

795
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,920
your system so

796
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:43,400
if I have some hot hot air that goes

797
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,359
around this this bottle and therefore

798
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,000
there's a heat exchange through the wall

799
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:51,440
that is going to heat up the bottle or

800
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,160
maybe cool it down you put the bottom in

801
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,040
the refrigerator it cools

802
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,359
down all right that

803
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,760
uh is an

804
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,760
interaction and

805
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,599
uh interactions are very several kinds

806
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:18,800
and we we will spend time in describing

807
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:24,480
and U giving models for these kind of

808
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,480
interactions first of all work and then

809
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,839
heat you will notice that uh we will

810
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,839
Define heat we will not we do not start

811
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,960
from

812
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:40,680
heat and this is very important uh if

813
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:44,839
you're fan of um logical

814
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,839
consistency because uh heat uh is

815
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:51,200
typically

816
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:54,359
defined uh by euristic arguments and by

817
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,040
a lot of hand waving even by the best

818
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:00,280
physicist so if you go uh there is a

819
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:04,240
series of lecture I'll mention another

820
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,680
in a moment that you may know by Fineman

821
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,880
that you find on YouTube he was a

822
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,720
wonderful

823
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:15,319
professor in the

824
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:19,079
60s and U he has this very funny

825
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:22,319
lectures was a great teacher and you

826
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:24,240
should see how uh he how much hand

827
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,160
waving he does in order to describe what

828
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,119
heat is because it has to do with molec

829
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,960
agitation and all that all right yes you

830
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,760
can do it that

831
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,520
way and you see here we do it in

832
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,839
entirely different way which is

833
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:46,119
equivalent but uh you will see where it

834
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:50,319
where it deres from it is a heat is

835
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:51,839
going to be a consequence of the laws of

836
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,599
thermodynamics

837
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:58,200
uh which which is the way it should

838
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,599
because after all heat as you correctly

839
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,000
mentioned is

840
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:06,359
a it's a PEC peculiar concept of of

841
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:12,079
thermodynamics so uh how could

842
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:16,520
you pretend or or or or or attempt to

843
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:21,240
describe it by just using mechanical

844
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:23,520
Concepts all right more of that uh as we

845
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,520
go

846
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:32,520
along um if a system under goes uh

847
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,880
spontaneous processes and is unable to

848
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:38,079
affect the state of the environment we

849
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,079
call it an isolated

850
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,680
system all right so we have the state

851
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,079
and we want to describe how the state

852
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,559
evolves in

853
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,200
time now this picture is a

854
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,760
trajectory but this trajectory is you

855
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,520
have to understand it as a a trajectory

856
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:06,440
in state space so

857
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,440
uh for every independent

858
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,880
property you should think of having

859
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,079
suppose you have uh just three

860
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,720
independent properties like XY

861
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:22,880
z uh then the state is a point here but

862
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,920
if I have more independent properties I

863
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,640
need more axis one for each independent

864
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,920
property so I need a multi-dimensional

865
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,640
space

866
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,920
not easy to draw on the Blackboard but

867
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:39,599
easy to well easy to imagine it's an

868
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:42,520
abstract idea so that's what we mean by

869
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:47,480
uh State space and the state that

870
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,480
evolves in time we call it the

871
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,480
trajectory

872
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,559
typically the description of the the

873
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,559
trajectory in your in our models is the

874
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,079
Sol

875
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:04,400
solution of a differential equation that

876
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:09,280
we call the equation of motion of the

877
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:11,520
system which says the rate of change of

878
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,520
the

879
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,280
State uh is some function of the state

880
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:24,119
itself and of the various forces

881
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,760
external forces or parameters of things

882
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:29,520
that you can control from outside of the

883
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:32,800
external forces like squeezing the

884
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,760
bottle or things like

885
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,760
that okay so that's the equation of

886
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:43,319
motion if your

887
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:45,480
model has the equation of motion like in

888
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:47,079
uh molecular Dynamic simulations I

889
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,559
believe you do have the equations of

890
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:53,280
motion and those are exactly what you

891
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,280
solve in order to see the system

892
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,559
evolve then

893
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,880
by analyzing that equation of motion or

894
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,599
maybe the results maybe the results will

895
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:08,640
suggest ideas about analyzing the

896
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:14,520
equation and finding some um

897
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,520
General uh features of that time uh

898
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,440
Evolution these features if you can

899
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,920
prove them that they are theorems of

900
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,920
equational

901
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,240
motion some

902
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,680
of these

903
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:36,799
theorems are

904
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:39,839
features of all models good models

905
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:42,119
successful models of physical

906
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,559
reality in other words what I'm saying

907
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:46,280
is

908
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:48,319
that if you're describing a piece of of

909
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,119
physical

910
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:54,359
reality with a with your

911
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:59,240
model that

912
00:49:54,359 --> 00:50:02,280
model uh so it have equation of

913
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:05,480
motion it we and that equation of motion

914
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,160
will have a couple always have a couple

915
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,960
of uh theorems no matter what the what

916
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,359
the system is small or large complicated

917
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,880
or simple

918
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:20,200
um those two theorems are General

919
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:23,559
features of all modeling assumptions for

920
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:28,520
modeling um or or modeling of of

921
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:32,599
physical reality uh then

922
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:36,160
is what we call I mean they become so

923
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:38,960
important these results because they're

924
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:44,880
General that we call them

925
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:47,319
laws like law of conservation of

926
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,640
momentum

927
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:54,119
uh and here in particular we will be

928
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:58,119
concerned about those that have to do

929
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,119
with energy and entropy

930
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:05,520
but the message here is that

931
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,839
uh these

932
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:12,240
results if you add the equation of

933
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:12,240
motion are theorems of the equation of

934
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,240
motion however there is an alternative

935
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:22,319
suppose you don't have the equation of

936
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,920
motion or you don't want to solve the

937
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,079
entire equation or motion for your

938
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,839
system because perhaps it's too

939
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,520
complicated I mean can you imagine

940
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:34,640
solving the equation of motion for 10 to

941
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:38,359
the how many I mean 10 to the 23

942
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,680
particles uh U if you do your molecular

943
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:42,079
Dynamics

944
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,799
simulations the number of particles may

945
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,520
be I don't know million but not 10 to

946
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:48,799
the

947
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,880
23

948
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:55,200
go so not only it is Impractical to

949
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,640
actually do

950
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,520
it but

951
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,119
uh is actually

952
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,640
useless

953
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:09,559
because you can uh extract uh a lot of

954
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,640
information by by first of all studying

955
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,880
smaller systems as long as they're not

956
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,760
too small we will

957
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,720
see uh but

958
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,160
also you may not need all the details of

959
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,160
the time

960
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:30,359
Evolution however even if you

961
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:32,760
give up the description in terms of a

962
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:35,559
full dynamical description in terms of

963
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,319
the full equation of

964
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:41,040
motion you shouldn't forget about these

965
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:43,280
two theorems that any equation of motion

966
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,280
must

967
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:49,280
satisfy at that level of the scription

968
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:53,280
you call them fundamental principle you

969
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:57,359
call them laws you call them

970
00:52:53,280 --> 00:53:01,440
postulates they become the starting

971
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:04,040
point something that you

972
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:08,799
know

973
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:11,400
uh must be satisfied by your

974
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:14,760
model and so instead of describing the

975
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:18,359
entire time Evolution we

976
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:22,240
use when we can or when it is

977
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:26,559
enough we use the idea of process the

978
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,200
idea of process is not only an initial

979
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,000
and a final state of your system on

980
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:36,000
which you want to check that those laws

981
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
are are

982
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:44,240
satisfied yes you do need an initial and

983
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:46,760
final state but you also need to

984
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,079
describe the

985
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:54,160
effects that the time evolution of your

986
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:58,119
system induced in the uh rest in the in

987
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,119
the environment of the system

988
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,200
so how do I

989
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:10,400
describe the effects on the environment

990
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,400
of the system well let's call B the

991
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:19,520
environment the effects on

992
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,520
b i describ by the change of its

993
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:27,319
state what else can I do more than just

994
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,720
saying how all the properties of the

995
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:34,480
change during this

996
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:38,160
process so I lose track of the details

997
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:41,680
of how it goes from A1 to A2 and how the

998
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,680
environment goes from B1 to

999
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,400
B2 uh and that's the

1000
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:50,480
simplification but I need to describe

1001
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,760
the initial and final states of my

1002
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,760
system and of the environment

1003
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,359
that so that's is what that's the idea

1004
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:05,480
of

1005
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,480
process the meaning of the word

1006
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,079
process and now we get uh ready to um

1007
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:17,599
this

1008
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,599
um to introduce the first

1009
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:24,960
law in order to introduce the first flaw

1010
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:28,760
we need uh to

1011
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:32,839
Define so a particular kind of process

1012
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:36,000
that allows us to

1013
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:40,240
connect this more general theory that we

1014
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:44,599
are constructing to what we know from

1015
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:48,720
mechanics so we consider the simplest uh

1016
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:48,720
mechanical object something like

1017
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:57,119
that here it's represented by a a mass

1018
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,359
in a gravity field like

1019
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,839
weight that's why we we're going to call

1020
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:06,160
this particular kind of process a weight

1021
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:09,160
process so a weight process is one in

1022
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,280
which the external effect you remember

1023
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,319
here this the external effect is the

1024
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,319
change of state of your system in this

1025
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:19,799
case for the weight process B is just

1026
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:23,240
the weight or the only effect that

1027
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:26,760
occurs outside of your system is the

1028
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:29,079
change in height or El

1029
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,280
of your

1030
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:34,160
weight of a

1031
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,599
weight so if if you have a process like

1032
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,440
this your system changes from one state

1033
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,280
to another and the only external effect

1034
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,119
is the change in elevation of a weight

1035
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,119
you call it we call it weight

1036
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:56,520
process if there is no change if the not

1037
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,960
even the the weight so if Z1 is equal to

1038
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,480
Z2 is equal to

1039
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:07,039
Z1 then there are no external

1040
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,280
effects this could be a spontaneous

1041
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:12,319
process but the idea of spontaneous

1042
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,319
process is

1043
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:21,240
really uh more demanding it requires

1044
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:23,440
that at all instance of time from T1 to

1045
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:27,039
T2 the weight

1046
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:30,280
outside doesn't move

1047
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:35,599
instead you could have a

1048
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:35,599
zero uh change in elevation weight

1049
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,520
process in which it's only the initial

1050
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,799
and final elevation of of the weight

1051
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,799
that are the same but during the process

1052
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:49,880
it may have went have gone up or down as

1053
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:56,160
long as at the end it goes back to the

1054
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:56,160
initial uh height then it would be zero

1055
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:07,520
okay so why is a way process uh

1056
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,520
important

1057
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,000
because it

1058
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:16,680
[Music]

1059
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,680
enters um the statement of the first

1060
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,119
law I know that

1061
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:28,960
usually uh especially in engineering

1062
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,280
applications but on not only uh you say

1063
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,880
all right I'm going to write the first

1064
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:36,359
law and by first law that what what you

1065
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,760
mean is really uh what we will call the

1066
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:42,359
energy balance

1067
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:44,839
equation okay but the first law in fact

1068
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:49,079
the way we're introducing

1069
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:51,880
here uh contains much more than just the

1070
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:53,760
idea of energy conservation which and

1071
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,200
and energy exchangeability that is

1072
00:58:53,760 --> 00:59:00,200
behind the the energy balance equation

1073
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:04,640
as we will see in a second but uh uh it

1074
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:08,960
also is what guarantees the existence of

1075
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,960
property energy for every

1076
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:17,039
system and it does

1077
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,839
so because we have loaded the word

1078
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:24,119
system if you go back to the to that

1079
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:28,520
picture of the proton and the electron

1080
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:30,559
okay and I said all right I cannot take

1081
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,440
the electron and call it a system it

1082
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:37,799
doesn't qualify as a system and in

1083
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:42,079
fact for this thing which is not a

1084
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:44,000
system I cannot apply the first law and

1085
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,200
as you will see the consequence of the

1086
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,559
first law will be the existence of

1087
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,039
property energy this thing doesn't have

1088
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:54,240
energy you cannot Define the energy of

1089
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:56,960
the electron when Bound in a

1090
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,960
proton why not

1091
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,200
well yes if you have an electron without

1092
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:06,680
the proton far away it has its own rest

1093
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:11,359
mass and maybe you can Define its energy

1094
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,359
as uh us using uh this famous

1095
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:16,280
formula but when it is bound to a proton

1096
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,599
and so there is

1097
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:24,599
a electrostatic

1098
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:26,559
interaction uh there is some energy that

1099
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:29,160
is related to this interaction it's

1100
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:34,000
called the interaction

1101
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:36,640
energy it's a property of the

1102
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:41,400
pair and there is no

1103
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:43,559
way no uh logical way in which you can

1104
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,680
assign part of this energy to the

1105
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:49,359
electron and part to the

1106
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,400
proton so that system doesn't have

1107
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,160
energy and so I'm happy that we have

1108
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,079
excluded it yes I'll be there in a

1109
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:57,559
moment uh I'm happy that we have

1110
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,520
excluded it by our definition of system

1111
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:02,440
so that we we will be able to say that

1112
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,599
every system as energy as a property

1113
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,680
every system satisfies the first flow

1114
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:12,280
the way we State we state

1115
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,280
it but it has to be a system

1116
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,880
yes the

1117
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,000
limit uh no for by for the electron by

1118
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,559
itself

1119
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
no but if I

1120
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:39,640
consider uh the atom and the atom is far

1121
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,880
from everything else

1122
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:45,240
then the

1123
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,280
two uh I mean this Force becomes an

1124
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:50,200
internal

1125
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:53,760
force and that energy the interaction

1126
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:56,920
energy becomes part of the energy of my

1127
01:01:53,760 --> 01:02:00,440
system so for example in ter ter

1128
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:02,359
of hamiltonians if you familiar with

1129
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,720
that you would write the hamiltonian of

1130
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:05,480
the

1131
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,680
electron

1132
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,920
uh which is the thing that represents

1133
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:14,359
the energy when the electron will be by

1134
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:17,160
itself the the amoni of the proton and

1135
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:19,359
then the interaction energy between

1136
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,839
electron and

1137
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:26,119
proton so that's well defined for this

1138
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:28,319
entire system for the combin

1139
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:29,960
for this actually for the only system

1140
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:35,000
you can Define for this

1141
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:36,680
situation but uh you cannot say ah okay

1142
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,200
but this is the energy of the electron

1143
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:42,640
no this would be the energy of the

1144
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,640
electron if the proton were weren't

1145
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,119
there okay

1146
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:08,039
no no no it's just this is just an

1147
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:12,559
example and this is the re the reason

1148
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:16,319
why I need okay suppose you have this is

1149
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:18,880
the moon and this is the

1150
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:22,400
earth okay same

1151
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:26,400
thing there is a gravitational force

1152
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:29,760
okay uh

1153
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,880
if you cannot consider just the

1154
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:37,760
moon as a

1155
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:42,319
system if for what you you want to

1156
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:44,720
describe it is important what it's uh

1157
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:48,000
interaction with the Earth

1158
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:50,000
is for the moon for the Moon is simpler

1159
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,760
in the sense that uh if you consider

1160
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,240
short instance of time in which the

1161
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:59,480
Earth is relatively fixed

1162
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:02,960
so there is no change in the relative

1163
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:06,440
distance then maybe for that instant of

1164
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,920
time the move the mo the moon will move

1165
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:12,880
a little bit the relative distance will

1166
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:15,599
not change so within that time frame

1167
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,760
maybe you can neglect uh the

1168
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:23,200
gravitational effect from from the

1169
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:27,680
Earth but it's exactly the same um uh

1170
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:31,960
idea or um

1171
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:35,359
or say suppose this is the air molecules

1172
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:38,559
like o2 molecules that are in this room

1173
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:41,440
and this is

1174
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:45,359
the

1175
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,359
cement molecules in the

1176
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:52,039
wall if

1177
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:56,319
I can model the cement molecules in such

1178
01:04:52,039 --> 01:05:00,160
a way that they are uh they imply a

1179
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:03,000
fixed um effect on the molecules

1180
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:06,000
outside so that this becomes an external

1181
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,839
force that does not depend on the

1182
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,799
position or or the movement of the of

1183
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:15,079
the the cement molecules in the wall

1184
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:19,240
then this is an external force and

1185
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:22,839
essentially what I do is substitute

1186
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:27,520
this with a an effective

1187
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:30,559
potential uh uh of the out side onto my

1188
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:34,520
internal molecules and that effective

1189
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,599
potential is a way to describe external

1190
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,160
uh

1191
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:40,119
forces

1192
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:42,720
okay so and this is what you need to do

1193
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:44,400
uh in order to come up with something

1194
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,680
that you can call a system and to which

1195
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:54,200
you can assign an energy that's what any

1196
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:56,680
model in physics is is uh is um is

1197
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,359
about all right

1198
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,319
I'll be happy to discuss it later more

1199
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:04,039
if you

1200
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:07,920
want later on any

1201
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:11,200
day okay so all right so what's the

1202
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:14,559
first law first law

1203
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:17,319
says this important uh it's actually

1204
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,319
made up of two

1205
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:23,279
statements the first one is that you

1206
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:28,880
take any

1207
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:31,680
system and take any two states of your

1208
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,480
system they can always be interconnected

1209
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,480
via a wave

1210
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:39,920
process so it's it's a matter of

1211
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,400
existence in your

1212
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,960
model you must allow this in order for

1213
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,920
it to be a good

1214
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,760
model you have to find a way to

1215
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,480
interconnect now there is something

1216
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,000
wrong in this slide I'll have to correct

1217
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,359
it the

1218
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:08,119
arrow because the law doesn't

1219
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:10,480
say that you can always do it in this

1220
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:12,960
direction it says you can interconnect

1221
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:17,279
them so if if you cannot go from A1 to

1222
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,279
A2 then you can do it from A2 to

1223
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:27,720
A1

1224
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:31,000
okay the second Ascension is

1225
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,000
about how

1226
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,640
much potential energy because we from

1227
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,599
mechanics we know that the the weight

1228
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,079
that goes up and down in gravity field

1229
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:48,119
has a change in potential energy okay

1230
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:52,079
so the potential energy uh change of

1231
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:55,720
your weight here depends

1232
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:58,440
only on the pair of states

1233
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:00,119
not on the particular way or a

1234
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,520
particular weight

1235
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:06,119
process with which you can go from one

1236
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:08,119
to the other or in other words all way

1237
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:13,000
processes that interconnect those two

1238
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:13,000
states have the same external

1239
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:20,080
effect or equivalent at the external

1240
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:24,920
effect

1241
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:26,920
because sure I'm using the weight in a

1242
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:30,920
gravity field build as a prototype of

1243
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:34,239
mechanical effect but you could also use

1244
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:38,920
um a charge in an electric

1245
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:42,159
field or you could use a a point mass

1246
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:45,719
that changes from one velocity to a

1247
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:47,960
higher velocity so the kinetic energy

1248
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:50,440
changes anything that is purely

1249
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:55,679
mechanical is the right hand side of

1250
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:55,679
that it's this external effect

1251
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:03,679
and so um

1252
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:10,759
yeah those two assertions in the first

1253
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:14,520
law allow you to define a measurement

1254
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:17,080
procedure for property energy because as

1255
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,000
we said before a property is

1256
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:22,440
defined by a measurement procedure and

1257
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,640
what's the measurement procedure for

1258
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:31,199
energy well you come to my love

1259
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:35,520
with your system in a given uh State and

1260
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:37,679
you ask me to measure uh its energy and

1261
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:41,480
I take your

1262
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:44,759
system and I ask you to

1263
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:46,799
pay uh and then I'll tell you before you

1264
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:50,640
leave that

1265
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:52,359
look really yeah on the door is written

1266
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,040
that I measure energy I actually measure

1267
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,880
energy

1268
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,040
differences okay

1269
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,960
so you have to pick another state of

1270
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:03,159
your system that I will consider as a

1271
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:06,560
reference and then I will measure the

1272
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:09,080
difference in energy between those two

1273
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:12,040
states and how do I do

1274
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:15,600
it well once you're gone because I don't

1275
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:19,760
want to uh show you my secrets I go on

1276
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:23,000
my shelves and find way processes and I

1277
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:26,040
find one that fits that allows me to

1278
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,320
change the state of your system from the

1279
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:30,640
reference one that you have chosen to

1280
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,280
the actual State you're interested

1281
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:38,159
in and I measure how

1282
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:40,920
much um gravitational potential energy

1283
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:43,840
change uh the weight has undergone when

1284
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,719
I did that so that's a that's a

1285
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,120
measurement procedure and I'll give you

1286
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:50,159
the

1287
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:52,960
number of

1288
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:56,560
course the units are already those of

1289
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,960
potential energy so they the of energy

1290
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,520
Jewel in

1291
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,520
si and

1292
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,960
uh

1293
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:12,080
um and what's nice of these two

1294
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:15,640
assertions is that they Val for any

1295
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:19,640
system any well defined system

1296
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:23,239
here and so and so you in principle can

1297
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:26,400
find this uh weight process for any pair

1298
01:11:23,239 --> 01:11:26,400
of states

1299
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:31,679
using that

1300
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:33,960
definition you can prove now if you're

1301
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:37,000
interested in the proof go to the

1302
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:39,920
book because I want to go quickly over

1303
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:45,480
these things because presumably uh these

1304
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:49,040
are uh easy Concepts but uh the proofs

1305
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:52,080
are not that uh obvious but you can

1306
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,080
prove from those

1307
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:59,800
statements this fact that um

1308
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:59,800
energy differences are

1309
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:07,360
additive so if I consider a system which

1310
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:09,480
is composite of two

1311
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,360
subsystems namely the definition of

1312
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:14,600
system applies for each of them so I

1313
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:18,159
consider a composite system C which for

1314
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:20,480
example could be the entire mini

1315
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:22,840
Universe namely my system plus the

1316
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,320
environment or could be just two systems

1317
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,000
so system C doesn't have to be isolated

1318
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:32,320
ated

1319
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,560
and in in either case you can

1320
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,520
prove by applying that same measurement

1321
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:41,960
procedure that defines energy that we

1322
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:46,800
have just seen if you apply to

1323
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:51,440
system a in state A1 you get a

1324
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:56,920
number I call it e energy of system a in

1325
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,920
state T1 or sayate state one

1326
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:07,920
B in this I apply the measurement

1327
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:07,920
procedure I get the value for for for

1328
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,960
B and then I

1329
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,760
also apply the measurement procedure to

1330
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,960
to the composite system when uh the

1331
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,840
state of the composite system that I

1332
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,600
call

1333
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:27,239
C11 is actually

1334
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:29,960
C11 is actually A1 B1 so it means that

1335
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:32,280
the it's it's the state in which

1336
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:35,560
subsystem a is in state one and

1337
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:38,520
subsystem B is in state

1338
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:41,639
B1 all

1339
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:45,199
right the theorem

1340
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:47,480
says that the difference between

1341
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:50,880
energy the difference in energy for

1342
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:53,679
system C from with respect to the

1343
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:58,040
reference is equal to the sum of the

1344
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:59,840
differences uh of of energy for a and b

1345
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,560
with respect to their respective

1346
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:05,760
references

1347
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:08,560
provided provided that I have chosen as

1348
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:13,960
reference a compatible reference for

1349
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,960
system C so uh I cannot choose

1350
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:21,719
arbitrarily the value for the reference

1351
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:23,400
uh energy for a and for B and also for

1352
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:26,320
C

1353
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,679
otherwise uh I cannot I do not get

1354
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,840
additivity of the values I only get

1355
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:31,840
additivity of the

1356
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,560
differences all

1357
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,840
right

1358
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:42,400
another almost trivial consequence of

1359
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,000
the definition of

1360
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,639
energy is that when the external effect

1361
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,719
when they when you have a a weight

1362
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:52,880
process so the only external effect is

1363
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:56,159
the changing height in a of a

1364
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:59,600
weight and the weight doesn't change in

1365
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:04,480
height so there is no external

1366
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:07,920
effect then E2 is equal to E1 so that's

1367
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,920
the principle of energy

1368
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,719
conservation so energy is conserved in a

1369
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,800
no net

1370
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,840
effect uh uh weight

1371
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:21,760
process the

1372
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:25,280
other idea which is important is the

1373
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,120
fact that energy

1374
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,520
can

1375
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:32,040
be uh exchanged so in other words you

1376
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,040
can

1377
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,719
U you may have energy of your system so

1378
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:44,320
the energy of your

1379
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,320
system uh may

1380
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:53,320
change but if it changes or suppose it

1381
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:56,920
goes down for one system it must must go

1382
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,920
up for some other system

1383
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:09,760
uh so this is a consequence of uh the

1384
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,760
two aspects that we have just seen

1385
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:21,960
conservation if system C is

1386
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:21,960
isolated we've seen here no change

1387
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:28,440
outside so the energy is concerned

1388
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,080
but the energy is also additive so if

1389
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:35,040
you combine these two it says that uh

1390
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:38,159
whatever change of energy occurs for air

1391
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:40,960
a system a is equal an opposite in sign

1392
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:44,120
to the change in B so if it goes down

1393
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,120
for a goes up for

1394
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:56,560
B most of the

1395
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:56,560
times our interest is in system a

1396
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:05,199
and so if our focus is on system a the

1397
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:12,400
effect on system

1398
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:15,880
B we sometimes call it uh energy

1399
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:18,199
transferred or actually in most of the

1400
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,000
times we call it energy exchanged

1401
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:23,040
between A and

1402
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,880
B because the idea is that if if this

1403
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,960
appears from a and appears from from B

1404
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,880
it has been

1405
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:35,760
exchanged now you

1406
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:38,320
could you could argue well maybe is this

1407
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:42,840
really uh a

1408
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:46,520
transfer and the argument uh um is

1409
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:50,520
fascinating you should uh I I I refer

1410
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:54,199
you to this um wonderful lecture by fan

1411
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:56,840
uh I added this just so you don't have

1412
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:59,880
it in your slide but I'll post it in

1413
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:02,840
today's post with the final slides for

1414
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:08,600
today and there is a link to the

1415
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:12,280
YouTube um lecture in which uh in a very

1416
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:15,480
funny way he uh describes these U

1417
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:19,040
principles of uh great conservation

1418
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:21,560
principles it explains why they're

1419
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:25,320
great

1420
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:30,800
uh but here the reference is because he

1421
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:33,159
explains also that using relativity

1422
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,159
Concepts uh but in a simple

1423
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:39,800
way

1424
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:43,600
um it explains that um things cannot

1425
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:49,880
just U if a property is

1426
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:56,239
conserved uh it also must be um actually

1427
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:58,000
transferable um how does you say um

1428
01:18:56,239 --> 01:19:01,600
yeah

1429
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,639
transferable um across the interface

1430
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,600
between one system and the other cannot

1431
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:09,880
it doesn't simply disappear here and

1432
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,880
reappear but it's it

1433
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:18,120
moves across the boundary so that's what

1434
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:22,960
we call uh local local

1435
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:25,520
conservation uh all right so for our for

1436
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,639
our purposes in order to obtain the

1437
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:30,600
equation that we usually call the energy

1438
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:34,400
balance equation we

1439
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:36,199
rewrite this right hand side with

1440
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:41,960
another

1441
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:41,960
symbol which is this symbol here it's

1442
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:50,320
energy

1443
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:53,760
uh the superscript means

1444
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:56,239
transferred from B to a the arrow

1445
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,800
matters

1446
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:01,320
during the time or during the process

1447
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:04,320
one two so during the time interval T1

1448
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,320
T2

1449
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:12,360
okay so so that uh with this way of of

1450
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:15,719
of defining uh you can rewrite this

1451
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:21,600
equation as uh the energy balance like

1452
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:26,080
here E2 minus E1 is equal to E

1453
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:28,080
A received from here I already started

1454
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,520
simplifying the notation so I dropped

1455
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,400
the B but I should have written

1456
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:36,080
B Because

1457
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,679
B is the environment of

1458
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:42,760
a and the

1459
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:45,520
arrow on the symbol is the equivalent of

1460
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:49,560
what of what you usually um you're used

1461
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:50,560
to as the like the sign convention for

1462
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,639
energy

1463
01:20:50,560 --> 01:21:00,120
exchanges now some people like to

1464
01:20:53,639 --> 01:21:02,920
say consider uh heat positive If U going

1465
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,080
out and work positive if going in or

1466
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:08,000
vice

1467
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:14,000
versa this notation allows you to Define

1468
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,960
whatever uh whatever using the

1469
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:20,080
arrow and the

1470
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,520
fact that this symbol here which we

1471
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:25,600
would call

1472
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:27,040
Energy exchange can have both positive

1473
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,639
and negative

1474
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:33,600
signs negative values if if it is

1475
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:35,280
positive it means that the uh the flow

1476
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:39,440
of energy is in the direction of the

1477
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:42,320
arrow so in that case it's positive if

1478
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:46,000
in but you could also Define it as

1479
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:48,960
positive out in that way the energy

1480
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,920
balance is written this

1481
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,719
way okay so you choose the sign

1482
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:57,040
convention

1483
01:21:54,719 --> 01:22:02,760
which allows you

1484
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:05,000
to avoid having a to have a figure or

1485
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:08,719
figure like here

1486
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,920
to give meaning to properties that are

1487
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:13,920
not just numbers because they have

1488
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:17,239
because interactions the energy change

1489
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:21,679
exchanged via an interaction between two

1490
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:25,000
systems uh has not only a value but also

1491
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,760
a Direction so it's like a vector it's a

1492
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,280
little simpler than a vector because

1493
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:34,040
it's just in or

1494
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:36,400
out but it's it has two items the amount

1495
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,400
and the

1496
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:42,560
Direction all right and then sometimes

1497
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:46,719
we also write the energy balance

1498
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:51,040
equation in a rate form so we divide by

1499
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:54,960
the the time interval that

1500
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:58,199
occurs uh between 21

1501
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:01,560
and if that time interval is uh

1502
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:03,800
infinitesimal meaning that we can follow

1503
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,719
the process as a function of time we can

1504
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:09,239
follow we actually this is a a more

1505
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:13,639
refined description that allows you not

1506
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:17,400
only in finite times intervals but also

1507
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:20,400
infinitesimal time intervals uh then you

1508
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:22,920
can write it in the form of a

1509
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:28,360
differential equation so the rate of

1510
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:31,199
change of the energy is equal to the

1511
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:34,120
energy the rate at which energy is

1512
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:38,159
transferred into your

1513
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:40,320
system okay so this is the energy

1514
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:42,080
balance

1515
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:45,560
equation

1516
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:49,679
uh yeah I don't know if you survive but

1517
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:53,000
uh I'll try to uh finish maybe a couple

1518
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:57,719
of minutes before but uh I prefer not to

1519
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:59,360
make a take a break because it uh uh it

1520
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:02,320
makes it

1521
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:05,960
um it allows you to go away that's the

1522
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:08,520
problem I don't want you to go

1523
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:13,120
away okay now

1524
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,840
um so I want to give the ingredients and

1525
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:18,000
maybe also the statement of the second

1526
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:21,800
law so that you so that you can see that

1527
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:25,040
uh in a couple of hours of uh of lecture

1528
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:28,719
you can uh do

1529
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,719
you can get almost to the second

1530
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:35,520
law the second law at least in the

1531
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:39,159
statement that we are going to

1532
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,159
adopt has to do with

1533
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,800
States and certain types of states in

1534
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:47,679
particular the stable equilibrium States

1535
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,639
will play a fundamental role in uh key

1536
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:55,280
role Central role in the second law so

1537
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:58,920
we need to Define what we mean by that

1538
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:04,119
so we can uh classify

1539
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:04,119
States uh according to uh two

1540
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:11,400
criteria so that makes four four

1541
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,360
possibilities uh the roles here are

1542
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:21,159
characterized by whether the state

1543
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:24,719
changes in time or does not change this

1544
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:28,280
time and the columns

1545
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:31,320
by what is the cause for those

1546
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:35,000
changes why does it change does it

1547
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:37,320
change because of something that uh

1548
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,159
occurs outside so it's an interaction

1549
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:41,960
with an external system with the

1550
01:25:39,159 --> 01:25:41,960
environment of the

1551
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:50,239
system or does it

1552
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:51,239
occur uh even if those interactions are

1553
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:56,679
turned

1554
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:56,679
off so for example uh in a spont is

1555
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:01,159
proc and these are the various

1556
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:10,119
possibilities so we call Un steady state

1557
01:26:06,679 --> 01:26:14,360
if it changes with time and that is

1558
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:19,080
because of external interactions the

1559
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:23,320
the the the typical

1560
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:23,320
example just to

1561
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,080
uh

1562
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:38,320
consider um bath

1563
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:43,679
tub in which you have water coming in

1564
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:46,960
from the foret and you have a drain open

1565
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:49,920
okay so if the flow rate and suppose

1566
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,679
that this is a simple simple system in

1567
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:54,880
which uh the

1568
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:58,239
only uh proper

1569
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:01,600
relevant property is the

1570
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:04,760
shape and position of this interface

1571
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,880
between Water and

1572
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:12,119
Air okay

1573
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:15,280
so an unsteady state would be one in

1574
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:19,639
which the level changes because there is

1575
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:19,639
no balance between the inflow and the

1576
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:29,920
outflow If instead you have uh that the

1577
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,320
state doesn't change in other words you

1578
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:34,040
have a flat

1579
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:36,760
surface that stays put at the same at

1580
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:40,639
the given height all the

1581
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:43,199
time it means that but this is due to

1582
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:47,719
the fact that there is balance between

1583
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:47,719
inflow and outflow that's a steady

1584
01:27:50,119 --> 01:27:59,840
state if I turn the flow off and uh

1585
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,840
close the

1586
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:09,920
drain and the surface is flat and

1587
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,920
doesn't move that is an equilibrium

1588
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:18,800
State If It Moves because maybe I shake

1589
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:21,080
it and there are waves that is a

1590
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:24,199
non-equilibrium

1591
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:28,159
state it in the non equilibrium state

1592
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:30,840
dat the moving aspect is related to the

1593
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:33,639
internal Dynamics not to the um

1594
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:37,000
interactions with the what what's

1595
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:39,320
outside not with external interactions

1596
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
okay so that's the idea of this

1597
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,000
nomenclature that we

1598
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:50,480
use now let's focus on

1599
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,360
equilibrium right there is equilibrium

1600
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:56,040
and

1601
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:56,040
equilibrium the concept of equilibrium

1602
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:02,239
is known from

1603
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:06,080
um uh mechanics so I'm sure you've seen

1604
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:06,080
it some somehow

1605
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:12,920
somewhere this the stability of

1606
01:29:11,239 --> 01:29:18,760
equilibrium

1607
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:21,440
also is important it is important in uh

1608
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:24,800
mechanics it is important in uh in the

1609
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:30,280
entire uh physics

1610
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:34,000
now if we go back to that idea of uh

1611
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:37,800
describing the change of

1612
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,880
state in state space so that's

1613
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:44,600
A1 a of

1614
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:46,360
T1 and this is a of T2 with the

1615
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,920
understanding that now the black this

1616
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:51,719
point represents a point in a

1617
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:56,040
multi-dimensional space in which each

1618
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:56,040
axis is an independent property

1619
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:01,840
okay so this is the solution of a

1620
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,080
differential equation which is the

1621
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,080
equation of motion of your

1622
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:14,880
system all right so if the state is

1623
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:19,360
changing because as time goes on it

1624
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:21,920
moves from here to there this is not an

1625
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:24,440
equilibrium

1626
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:27,000
State okay

1627
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:30,440
an equilibrium state would be one in

1628
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,440
which the state does not change so

1629
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,360
what's the trajectory the trajectory is

1630
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:36,119
is a

1631
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:39,320
point you start there and you remain

1632
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:39,320
there so that's

1633
01:30:42,199 --> 01:30:46,840
equilibrium the question is of

1634
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:54,840
stability is whether trajectories that

1635
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:58,800
are nearby where do they go

1636
01:30:54,840 --> 01:31:01,639
okay you know let me you play it with

1637
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:06,199
the with the game of mathematicians who

1638
01:31:01,639 --> 01:31:08,000
likes epsilons and Deltas okay uh so the

1639
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:11,480
mathematician in this case the

1640
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,480
mathematician's name is

1641
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:19,600
liapunov maybe there is

1642
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,600
a not sure about

1643
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,800
U right sorry for the spelling maybe

1644
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,639
it's wrong

1645
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,760
I'm not sure about the O

1646
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:32,679
there yeah I don't think there is there

1647
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:37,600
is okay all right so yuno

1648
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:41,679
says give me if the state this state

1649
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:45,280
equilibrium state is stable give me any

1650
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,280
small number

1651
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:52,600
Epsilon then I can

1652
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:55,840
find a smaller number Delta which is a

1653
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,840
function of Epsilon

1654
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:03,840
such

1655
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:06,119
that if I consider uh all the states

1656
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,239
that are within distance

1657
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:14,520
Delta uh from the equilibrium State So

1658
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:16,440
within this small uh hypers sphere ball

1659
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,159
of radius

1660
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:21,159
Delta any

1661
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:24,880
trajectory that

1662
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:28,679
goes that has a point in there

1663
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:31,639
will not evolve farther

1664
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:34,159
away than the bigger

1665
01:32:31,639 --> 01:32:35,800
sphere so it will stay closed so to

1666
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:38,040
speak that's the

1667
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:41,040
idea so this would

1668
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:41,040
be

1669
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:49,080
stable but actually this this definition

1670
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:51,880
of stability is

1671
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:54,560
locally locally

1672
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:57,159
stable okay so then that would be a

1673
01:32:54,560 --> 01:33:01,119
feature of this

1674
01:32:57,159 --> 01:33:01,119
state and also of that

1675
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,880
state

1676
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:09,880
however and I'm not going to because I

1677
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:12,880
don't remember it and doesn't matter uh

1678
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:16,000
to give you the Epsilon version of the

1679
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:19,199
uh meta stability but it can be done I

1680
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,199
can give you the reference for

1681
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:24,520
that there is a difference between this

1682
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:26,119
locally stable uh state and equilibrium

1683
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:28,840
State and these other locally stable

1684
01:33:26,119 --> 01:33:30,960
equilibrium State this one which we call

1685
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:33,880
Meta

1686
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:37,800
stable is such

1687
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:40,560
that look what I can do I

1688
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,119
can in a weight

1689
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:47,360
process

1690
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:52,040
take this mass or whatever it is take it

1691
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:55,000
up he up to the Casp and then take it

1692
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:56,920
down to this same level so that we are

1693
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,840
at the same level

1694
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:02,320
here so in order to do that I had to

1695
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:06,320
spend some uh energy from the weight

1696
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:09,840
outside to pull the mass

1697
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:13,480
up but then that

1698
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:16,880
energy uh is given back to the

1699
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:19,199
weight at least if I get exactly to the

1700
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,199
same

1701
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:28,760
height at that stage I have been able to

1702
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:32,520
do what I have been able to change the

1703
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:35,840
state into a different an entirely

1704
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,840
different state this

1705
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:42,159
one which if I let it go it will start

1706
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:45,960
bouncing back and

1707
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:48,080
forth okay so definitely this situation

1708
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:51,520
in which the thing bounces back and

1709
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:53,840
forth is different from this one all

1710
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,000
right so

1711
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,400
stable equilibrium

1712
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,600
state I'm sorry this meta stable

1713
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:04,560
equilibrium State I have been able to

1714
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:08,199
change it to a different state without

1715
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,199
leaving any external

1716
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:16,320
effects whereas this is not possible for

1717
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:18,960
these lower U lowest uh energy

1718
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:22,440
equilibrium

1719
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:24,239
State because if I want to go if you

1720
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:26,000
want to change it

1721
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:28,320
wherever I want to go I need to spend

1722
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,480
some energy and it will not return it

1723
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:32,679
back to

1724
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:32,679
me all

1725
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:41,719
right so with this in mind the idea and

1726
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:45,199
the actual definition of stable

1727
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:48,320
equilibrium state which is important

1728
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:52,239
very important for the statement for our

1729
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:54,840
statement of the second law

1730
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:58,679
is stay equilibrium state is an

1731
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:58,679
equilibrium state that cannot be

1732
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:04,679
changed uh without

1733
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:08,239
leaving uh

1734
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:10,520
net external

1735
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:13,760
effects

1736
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:15,840
without uh net external effects I cannot

1737
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,199
change a stable equilibrium

1738
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:24,199
State and why is that

1739
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:28,920
important oh sorry uh right I have the

1740
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:30,639
time no okay why is that important we'll

1741
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:34,199
return then to the previous

1742
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:37,320
slide because the second law is about

1743
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:40,719
this question IT addresses and gives an

1744
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:45,239
answer to this question how many stable

1745
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:45,239
equum states does a system

1746
01:36:47,159 --> 01:36:55,520
have we all know the answer that

1747
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:55,520
mechanics gives no mechanics

1748
01:36:56,679 --> 01:37:05,040
says one only one is the minimum

1749
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:09,760
energy provided of course you have

1750
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:11,560
fixed uh the number of particles and the

1751
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:13,719
values of the parameters of your

1752
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:16,760
external

1753
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:20,480
forces okay

1754
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:22,800
so that's the answer in

1755
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:25,520
mechanics there is only one equilibrium

1756
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,520
state

1757
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:36,560
however the statement that we will uh

1758
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:36,560
adopt which is due to atopos and

1759
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:45,520
Kenan uh is

1760
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:48,159
that no in

1761
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:52,199
thermodynamics that's not

1762
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:54,880
true uh there is a one stable

1763
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:57,840
equilibrium State once you have

1764
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:01,159
fixed the numbers the number of

1765
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:04,440
particles and the values of the

1766
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:07,679
parameters you have one equilibrium

1767
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:10,239
State stable equilibrium state for every

1768
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,239
value of the

1769
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:17,320
energy which of

1770
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:18,840
course appears to be a

1771
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:23,199
contradiction

1772
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:26,920
with uh mechanics and as you know people

1773
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:31,360
have G uh on for

1774
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:33,159
a cental talking about this uh

1775
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:35,280
discrepancy between mechanics and

1776
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:37,920
thermodynamics and how do we resolve it

1777
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:42,159
and so on we'll see that there is no

1778
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:45,520
discrepancy and there is no um serious

1779
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:48,440
uh problem the moment we realize that

1780
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:52,280
the States considered in mechanics is

1781
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:55,440
just a subset of the States considered

1782
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,440
in thermodynamics

1783
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:01,960
uh and it actually we will see that this

1784
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:04,800
is the subset of states for which the

1785
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:07,440
entropy is equal to zero but we haven't

1786
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:13,320
defined entropy yet entropy definition

1787
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:15,239
will come next time uh and uh uh so for

1788
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:19,119
the moment I think I would finish since

1789
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:23,920
I promised five minutes earlier uh and

1790
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:26,920
uh we'll uh take it uh from here

1791
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,920
okay
