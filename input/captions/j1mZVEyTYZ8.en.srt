activities such as investing in new

prescribed period of time in exchange

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,039
for an attractive remuneration from the

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,760
beneficiaries of the service via

22
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,239
regulated tariffs although utility

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,399
concessions have been attempted with

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,680
mixed levels of success in developing

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,399
countries around the world Stoner and

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,680
other Mighty leaders see them as a

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
promising tool to help end energy

28
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,960
poverty you're bringing money and sound

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,799
management from investors improving the

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,000
quality of the system Stoner says um has

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,840
been a success overall but the

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,479
remuneration is now perceived as

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,360
excessive and it was not meant to

34
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,080
increase rural electrification in a

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,640
country with a low access rate despite

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,240
the moderate cost impact um has turned

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
into a political problem and the

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,240
government may not renew that concession

Conference on concessions in the power

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,399
sector the event hosted by the

53

and the global commission to end energy

poverty subsaharan Africa has more than

60
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,680
600 million people without electricity

61
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,000
Perez araka notes energy poverty is a

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,480
huge problem so at the conference we are

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,400
trying to draw attention to the

64
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,480
instrument of concessions as an approach

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,720
that combines business Regulatory and

66
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,560
financial aspects in a way that can

67
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,239
improve the performance of utilities and

68
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,640
attract private investment concessions

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
have frequently been ignored in the

70
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,920
current policy debate and we wanted to

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
reverse that

72
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,760
Trend confronting

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,400
challenges in most countries with

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,800
significant levels of energy poverty

75
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,239
Stoner says the major problems lie not

76
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,040
in generation or transmission of

77
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,159
electricity but rather in distribution

78
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,280
often distribution utilities fail to

79
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,159
provide reliable service which

80
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,640
discourages customers from connecting to

81
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,800
the grid many who do connect do so

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,319
illegally drawing power without paying

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,120
for it which drives up costs for paying

84
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,319
customers also Distributing electricity

85
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,720
to rural areas is typically a losing

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,360
proposition from a financial perspective

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,040
making it difficult for governments or

88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,040
private operators to build viable

89
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,440
systems that provide universal

90
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,799
access the distribution system is where

91
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,959
the rubber meets the road stonor says

92
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,840
it's where all the hardware of the

93
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,280
electrical system comes into contact

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,280
with the customers to solve these

95
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,840
problems Stoner says governments would

96
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,760
benefit from designing concessions in

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,720
new ways for instance concessions can be

98
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,640
designed with viable business models for

99
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,239
off-grid Solutions like minig grids and

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,120
Standalone systems based on affordable

101
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,840
tariffs along with subsidies to

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
developers sub franchises can be created

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,080
that carve out territories within

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,799
presently unviable distribution

105
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,840
companies where suitable combinations of

106
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,200
diverse customers can make possible

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,599
viable business models Santos Jose Diaz

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Pastor a member of the universal energy

109
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,720
access lab helped to organize the

110
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,200
conference

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
while the ideas behind utility

112
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,159
concessions are sound he says it is

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,879
challenging to apply those ideas to

114
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,239
dozens of different countries that all

115
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,879
have their own specific features there's

116
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,360
no framework that works everywhere he

117
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,359
says when you analyze concessions there

118
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,919
are so many things you can adapt to each

119
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,519
country the major problem is getting the

120
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,960
capital to make all the Investments that

121
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,240
are needed but implementation is where

122
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,000
the plans usually fail you have to

123
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,479
design business models with financing

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,759
schemes that are sustainable over the

125
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,240
long term

126
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,160
learning from the

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,960
past Perez araga says that governments

128
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,080
and private operators are already

129
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,680
applying lessons learned from previous

130
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,600
concession agreements for instance he

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,560
points to a concession in a flood prone

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
area of India after the area was hit by

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,800
a cyclone the government held the

134
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,080
private operator responsible for

135
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,759
repairing the damage only to see the

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,120
company go broke and abandon the area

137
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,560
but in a more recent concession

138
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,240
agreement in the same region Perez araga

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,720
says the government stepped in to

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,600
provide funding after a natural disaster

141
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,039
allowing the private operator to restore

142
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,479
service to most areas within 24 or 48

143
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,600
Hours the company has the confidence

144
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,039
that they are supported by the

145
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,360
government and so they will do

146
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,080
everything that is needed to provide

147
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,520
good service he says another important

148
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,240
lesson governments and private operators

149
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,919
must collaborate and ensure that their

150
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,319
agreements will be financially viable

151
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,160
for all parties in one concession

152
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,960
agreement in Sagal Perez araga says the

153
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
government maintained control of more

154
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,360
economically viable Urban Distribution

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,560
Systems while giving over control of

156
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,120
unprofitable rural Distribution Systems

157
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,960
to a private operator with

158
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,840
unsatisfactory results the regulated

159
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,840
tariffs were unable to cover the cost of

160
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,639
the service and there were no subsidies

161
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Perez araga says you have to create a

162
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,479
concession business model that is viable

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,400
and sustainable and that typically

164
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,319
requires cross subsidization among urban

165
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,199
and rural areas also people have to

166
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,319
learn to write sound contracts for

167
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,680
instance with clear termination Clauses

168
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,280
there are silly mistakes that people

169
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
have made because they were not thinking

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,680
of the many things that could go

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,759
wrong looking

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,560
ahead greguar jako who was a mighty

173
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,080
research fellow while helping organize

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,479
the conference says organizers had three

175
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,400
main goals for the event first they

176
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,000
wanted to create a platform for in-depth

177
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,800
discussions about how utility

178
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,080
concessions should be structured and

179
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,840
financed second they wanted to build a

180
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,400
network of senior practitioners who

181
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,639
could advise one another on the topic

182
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,880
and finally they wanted to pave the way

183
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,240
for a larger in-person conference later

184
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,479
in the year the experts were eager to

185
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,639
share jeo says I could feel the

186
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,680
enthusiasm for the first time they had

187
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
an opportunity to talk in a structured

188
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,840
way about their experiences we don't

189
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,120
want to only talk about concessions and

190
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,800
energy poverty once a crisis appears or

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,800
when a Development Bank has money for a

192
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,039
