2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,120
okay so next let's think about uh the t-

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,120
cell response to cancer and how uh this

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,480
goes wrong so uh we know from just

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,439
Decades of work that cancer really is

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,600
evading uh te- cell killing and how this

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:24,240
happens is it's driving the te- cells to

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,320
a state called exhaustion so uh normally

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,760
te- cells are circulating in our blood

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,279
and we're going to call these naive tea

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,720
cells and when there's a tumor the te-

12
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,800
cells will migrate to the side of the

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,040
tumor so for instance in melanoma the

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,800
te- cells will migrate to the skin and

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,840
these te cells will encounter the cancer

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,000
cell which is displaying on its surface

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,559
this non-self antigen and they will

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,280
enter What's called the progenitor State

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,840
as they become activated now these t-

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,719
cell States then start to transition so

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,640
the progenitor State goes to a state

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,199
that's called the affector state which

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,399
is good at killing tumor cells and then

24
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:00,199
this state unfortunately transitions

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,519
over to a state called the terminal

26
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,199
exhausted state which is not so good at

27
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,360
killing tumor cells so these t- cell

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,400
States they're all considered to be

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,680
exhausted te- cells but they are

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,000
exhausted to different degrees and the

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,920
t- cell States themselves are encoded by

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,320
gene expression programs so remember

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,320
this are these are groups of genes that

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,560
are turned on together in sort of a

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,320
shared biological process and these gene

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,200
expression programs are really analogous

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,560
to the gene expression programs we'

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,439
introduced for cancer when talking about

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,880
melanogenesis or this epithe to meenal

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
transition so similarly each of these t-

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,960
cell States the progenitor State the

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
affector state and the terminal

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,000
exhausted state are encoded by gene

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,960
expression programs and measuring these

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,320
programs will tell us what the te- cells

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,360
are doing so now let's look at this from

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,520
a more visual setting so here we have

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,240
this diagram where we're going to look

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,119
at the t- cell response to cancer and on

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,960
the left Y axis we have the cancer

51
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,200
burden so how much cancer there is and

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,960
that's shown in this um Brown Line and

53
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,479
on the right y- Axis we have the t- cell

54
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,560
response in purple and so again what

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,479
happens is a naive t- cell will migrate

56
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,640
to the side of the tumor as the cancer

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,760
starts to grow and it will transition to

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,040
a progenitor State and then it will

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,720
further transition to an affector State

60
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,440
and as it transitions to the affector

61
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,400
state the te cell starts to actually

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
kill the cancer cells so this is where

63
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,519
you get this peak in the cancer burden

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,680
and it actually starts to go down now

65
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,360
unfortunately the effector t- cell state

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,360
does not last it actually starts to

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
transition

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,720
to this terminal exhausted T Cell state

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,599
which is weaker at tumor killing so the

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,760
T Cell response start the T Cell

71
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,840
response starts to go down the cancer

72
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,720
burden just starts to stabilize and so

73
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,599
you reach the stal where the cancer is

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,440
still there and the te- cells aren't

75
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,680
quite able to clear out the cancer so

76
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,560
this a stalemate or Deton between the

77
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,640
cancer cells and the tea

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,840
cells so scientists have been studying

79
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,040
uh terminal exhausted te- cells for

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,239
decades and here are some consensus

81
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,959
features about those te- cells so the

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
first is that they have this inability

83
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,959
to control the cancer growth so you

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,720
don't go all the way to having no cancer

85
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,840
it just sticks around uh there's also

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,959
this loss of the t- cell affector

87
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,440
killing function so the te- cells are

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,440
blunted and they're no longer really uh

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
actively killing the cancer cells in a

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,720
manner that controls cancer uh there's

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,760
also these expression of these

92
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,080
inhibitory receptor uh genes and this is

93
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,959
going to be talked about in the cancer

94
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,680
immunotherapy section and then finally

95
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,959
the tea cells in the terminal exhaust

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,959
State have less ability to undergo

97
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,920
self-renewal and make more of themselves

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,280
okay so let's recap what we just learned

99
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,360
in the past two slides about te- cell

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
exhaustion so naive te cells are

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,280
starting in the blood and then they

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
migrate into the tumor and they enter

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,439
into this sort of exhausted set of

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
programs and the te- cells when they

105
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,840
encounter the cancer cell enter the

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,400
progenitor State and then they

107
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,720
differentiate or transition into an

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,439
affector State and finally they enter

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,040
this uh bad termin exhausted State now

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,000
the terminal exhausted State as we said

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,599
before is weak at killing tumor cells

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,400
whereas the progenitor and affector

113
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,400
states are very strong at killing tumor

114
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,200
cells and finally there's a last state

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,600
that the te- cells can enter which is

116
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,359
the cycling State and uh the cycling

117
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
state is just the te- cells entering the

118
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,600
cell cycle and making more copies of

119
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,840
themselves as they undergo cell division

120
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,479
so cycling is particularly good

121
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,759
especially for the affector te- cells

122
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,440
because these are the ones that are

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,199
going to uh go in and kill the cancer

124
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,720
and if you're making more of those

125
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,960
affector te cells it's like having a

126
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,600
bigger weapon uh against the

127
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,000
cancer so what's happening in the cancer

128
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,560
environment again is that there's

129
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,360
something about the cancer and the

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,400
surrounding tissue environment that's

131
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,240
pushing cells away from the progenitor

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,720
States and these affector states and

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,199
forcing them into this terminal

134
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,160
exhausted t- cell State and so you can

135
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,080
think about this as a distribution right

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,320
the te- cells can be in any of these

137
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,240
states but in the cancer environment

138
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,460
there's a strong push to be in the

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,170
terminal exhausted state

140
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,170
