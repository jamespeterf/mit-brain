1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,880
okay good

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,160
morning so let me remind you where we

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,199
were we dealing with systems with

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,640
chemical

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,199
reactions we talked about the role of

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,279
the activated

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,520
complex in the mechanis

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,200
of converting reactants into products as

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,200
a result of

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,320
collisions and

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,039
uh in order to do

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,160
that then we did the chemical

13
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,760
equilibrium derived from the principle

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,760
of Maximum

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,519
entropy so if you remember one of the

16
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,640
key modeling assumptions that we had to

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:06,760
make was to

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,040
integrate the what we call the simple

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,640
system

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,280
model which uh others call the

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,079
thermodynamic limit or the many

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,640
particle

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:26,720
model in which you remember that uh the

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,479
idea was that essentially we could uh

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,960
add or remove partitions in in our

26
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,280
system without it affecting the

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,360
properties here we add also the fact

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,719
that we add and remove or say turn on

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,960
and off very conceptual idea the

30
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:52,479
chemical uh

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,000
reactions and that doesn't affect the

32
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,600
properties of course it affects the time

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,240
Evolution because it will inhibit or

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,680
allow chemical reactions to proceed but

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,920
for the in instantaneous picture that we

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,560
take you know when we measure properties

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,560
of our mixture with chemical

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,239
reactions uh that the reactions are on

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,959
or off doesn't make a lot of a

40
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,840
difference because uh for many particles

41
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,080
because the uh role of the activated

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
complexes um

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,599
is uh

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,360
minute since they're few since they're

45
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,400
very

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,200
shortlived and

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,159
also

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,560
because the uh

49
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:47,640
collisions that uh produce chemical

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,879
reactions

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,000
are much fewer than uh the collisions

52
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,560
that

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,159
simply um

54
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,920
redistribute energy among the molecules

55
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:07,920
uh and and so

56
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,720
um as part of our assumption here that

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,080
we can model the properties as if it

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,720
were a stable equilibrium state with the

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,840
actions turned off is uh also the

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
assumption that

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:27,080
the that the nonchemical collisions are

62
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,680
much faster are much more abundant and

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:35,920
therefore equilibrate uh energy much

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:38,760
faster than the the the effective

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,080
chemically chemical

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,879
collisions so that all is uh in order to

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,519
allow us

68
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,920
to

69
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,959
essentially

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,680
uh

71
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,519
represent this family of um would be

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,280
equilibrium States if you didn't have

73
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,040
chemical reactions the blue curves

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,840
and this family has

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,519
a one parameter if you have one chemical

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,079
reaction or as many parameters as um

77
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,199
there are chemical reactions so you

78
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,519
shift from one to the other by changing

79
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:23,759
the reaction coordinate

80
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:27,800
Epsilon and the envelope of these uh

81
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,039
stable equilibrium State curves is the

82
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,639
stable equilibrium State curve for the

83
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,120
system with chemical reactions that's

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,600
where

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,360
the stable equilibrium states

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,840
are with the reactions

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,840
on and that's where we

88
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,080
calculate the maximum we apply the

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,479
maximum entropy principle and the

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,400
maximum entropy principle implies that

91
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,000
the these derivatives of how the entropy

92
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,240
varies with respect to those parameters

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,919
must be zero

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,320
and these derivatives are what we called

95
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,320
the

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,000
affinities these are the entropic

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:20,840
affinities some others call

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Affinity U these times uh minus the

99
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,720
temperature that would be

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,120
the energetic

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,880
Affinity okay uh so

102
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,880
and then by

103
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,720
applying the definition the simple

104
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,080
definition of affinity which is this one

105
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,840
and uh

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,199
applying the expressions for the

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,560
chemical potentials that we have uh

108
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:56,360
worked out in several uh

109
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,880
cases we end up with the law of mass

110
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,120
action this is a general so it's a non-

111
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,400
equilibrium law of mass mass action

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,280
which becomes the equilibrium one when

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,960
uh you set the Affinity is equal to

114
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,680
zero and as you have seen we

115
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,759
defined

116
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,520
various various forms that we call all

117
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,800
call equilibrium constants for example

118
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,880
this one is a dimensionless equilibrium

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,599
constant which is simply uh e to the

120
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,560
minus the GBS free energy of the

121
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,560
reaction divided by RT

122
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,599
um this other

123
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,919
one is the equilibrium

124
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,840
constant in terms of temperature and

125
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:46,919
also pressure for a

126
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,039
gas this this is for the gas and so this

127
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:54,639
is the pressure

128
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:57,000
dependence or you often work with

129
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,759
concentrations the marity so how many

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,520
moles per volume you have per

131
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:07,199
liter and um so you you use this symbol

132
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,720
for those concentrations and uh and then

133
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,080
you have this form so we'll um we

134
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,599
proceed using more often now this this

135
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,599
form

136
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,039
here and of course these various forms

137
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,120
of the chemical equilibrium uh

138
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,879
constantes are related to one

139
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,520
another as an example

140
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:37,160
before we proceed I wanted to just uh

141
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:41,280
mention this one which is that of

142
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,319
U that which happens in in pure

143
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,280
water the fact that

144
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,280
water

145
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,800
uh ionizes itself and so there is an

146
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,720
equilibrium

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,639
between um the water molecules and the

148
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,639
formation of the hydronium or the hydro

149
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,639
oide

150
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,720
ions and as you know the the abundance

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,479
of these

152
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,599
ions

153
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:21,919
defines the scale of acidity

154
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:26,280
of of a of a of a of an aquous

155
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:30,800
solution in fact we what we call

156
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:36,959
pH is minus the log base 10

157
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:41,399
of the concentration of the h3o plus

158
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:45,640
ions and sometimes you call also

159
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,560
p uh minus the log of of these

160
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,680
concentration now since this is a

161
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,640
concentration so it is dimensional it it

162
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,080
is mole per liter you have to divide

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,760
here by the the dimension so it's this

164
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,959
is kind of a you put under the logarithm

165
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,279
number which which is dimensional so you

166
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,000
have to take the dimensions away or use

167
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,600
the convention that you're always going

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,519
to use those

169
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Dimensions because usually logarithms

170
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,040
like to have non non-dimensional numbers

171
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,320
as

172
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:23,480
arguments

173
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,200
um here is how the law of mass action uh

174
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,160
looks when you write it for that

175
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,040
equation see the stochiometric

176
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,000
coefficients are minus two for water so

177
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,480
when you get to this exponent here it's

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,920
a minus two so that's why the

179
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,519
concentration of water goes to the

180
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,000
denominator and then plus one and plus

181
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,680
one for the other

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,680
two uh

183
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,920
molecules ions so that's they go to the

184
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,279
numerator with a power

185
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:02,600
one so this is the product of those

186
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:06,360
and that has to be

187
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,839
equal to the at equilibrium has to be

188
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,040
equal to the equilibrium constant based

189
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,040
on

190
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,120
concentrations now in this business

191
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,560
therefore you need to compute the

192
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,600
concentration of water of pure water and

193
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,880
that's defined by how many molecules you

194
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,720
have per liter you can write it as the

195
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,519
density over the molecular weight and

196
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:37,560
for example at 25 degrees

197
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,079
C density is 997 gram per liter

198
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,480
molecular weight is

199
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:47,079
18 gram per mole and so that

200
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,639
concentration is 55.3 moles per liter

201
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,639
you need it

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,440
squared so in order to not to carry this

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,760
along in in in the practice of chemical

204
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,240
uh engineering

205
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:08,000
often it uh almost always you find uh

206
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,519
this product of the this equilibrium

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
constant times the square of the water

208
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:19,000
concentration you find it called the KW

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,680
the equilibrium constant for

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,440
water and then therefore this equation

211
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,160
rewrites this way that the the product

212
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,120
of the concentrations of the hydronium

213
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:34,399
and the hydroxide ions

214
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,800
is equal to this constant which constant

215
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,880
is not because you remember that

216
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,120
equilibrium constants vary a lot with

217
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,639
with

218
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,800
temperature

219
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:49,760
so um and also this constant has

220
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,720
Dimensions because uh for this

221
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,760
particular uh

222
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,040
reaction uh usually also

223
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,920
the equilibrium constant B on

224
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,480
concentration is dimensional it has

225
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,399
dimensions of the overall

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,040
concentration to the to the power equal

227
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,760
to the sum of the stochiometric

228
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,160
coefficients now for this particular

229
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,440
reaction the sum of the stochiometric

230
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:20,040
coefficients is zero because minus 2 +

231
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:23,120
1+ one is zero so this uh is

232
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,440
dimensionless it coincides with the

233
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,320
equilibrium constant KT without the

234
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:34,199
C so this is dimensionless but this is

235
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:37,120
not so the KW has dimensions of mole

236
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,120
squar per liter

237
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:48,199
squar at 25° C it is almost exactly

238
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,199
equal to 10 Theus 14 in those

239
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,440
units and if you

240
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,639
have

241
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,760
um a neutral solution in which there is

242
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,560
no

243
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,040
um acid or base dissolved that would

244
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,360
capture some of these ions they would be

245
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,399
uh

246
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,600
equally populated so you their

247
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:18,199
concentrations will be equal and

248
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:24,480
therefore each one takes 10 the minus

249
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:28,240
7 10us 7 * 10 10us 7 gives 10 Theus

250
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,800
14 and 10 the minus 7 put into the log

251
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,839
base 10

252
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,720
with the minus in front makes pH equal 7

253
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:41,360
and that pH equals 7 is therefore this

254
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,880
the the the notion of

255
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,320
um

256
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,680
neutral so like pure water is neutral

257
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,920
and it has a pH equal

258
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,560
7 at 25 C though because if you go at

259
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,320
different temperatures for example you

260
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,839
go here you you see how for example at

261
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:07,440
at Body temp temperature which is 37°

262
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:09,720
C the KW is not 10 to the 4 minus to 10

263
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,399
to the minus 14 but it's three times

264
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:17,120
three 3.55 times and that makes the pH

265
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:21,240
for neutral 6.7 at 100°

266
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,240
6.17 or at 0 degrees is

267
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:30,120
7.47 okay so this is a one of the

268
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,800
applications of equili of course is just

269
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,800
one of the many

270
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,079
examples so now we already talked about

271
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,440
the elements

272
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:47,560
of CH the model for chemical kinetics

273
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,199
and we want to develop more details as

274
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,040
you see we are transitioning from the

275
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,120
SEC second part of the course to the

276
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,120
third part because we've already been

277
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,079
talking about non equilibrium uh from

278
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:05,920
the first lecture I believe

279
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:08,720
so uh well but the more we advance in in

280
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,320
and we get close to our uh stable

281
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,800
equilibrium which will be the end of the

282
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,160
course uh we'll uh talk more and more

283
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,160
about non-equilibrium

284
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,920
States you remember this picture in

285
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,800
which we

286
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,320
presented uh the idea of a potential

287
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,319
energy

288
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,399
surface and that's where we we what we

289
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:35,959
used to define the activated complex the

290
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,560
potential energy surface

291
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:41,839
represents uh the energy at zero

292
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,240
temperature of the various

293
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,959
configurations with which you can find

294
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,759
the reactants or the

295
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:52,199
products uh for example these are the

296
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,720
reactants these are the products and

297
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:59,959
here um in in this

298
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,880
scenario um along a path of

299
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,680
steepest Ascent here and steepest

300
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:08,639
descent here or vice

301
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,160
versa you find the sdle point which is

302
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,560
the

303
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,600
lowest uh point that allows you to go

304
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:21,639
from one Valley of

305
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,639
this landscape to this this other

306
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,079
Valley

307
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,480
now that's a zero

308
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,920
temperature if there is uh temperature

309
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,279
it means

310
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:42,759
that part of the energy of the molecules

311
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:46,040
is in their other uh in their degrees of

312
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,279
freedom translational rotational

313
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,160
vibrational

314
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:55,079
electronic they all are capable of

315
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,519
storing energy in in the

316
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:02,880
molecules uh at low temperatures most of

317
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:06,400
the energy is stored in the uh let's

318
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,799
call them easy uh degrees of freedom

319
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,240
which is the translational the

320
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,360
rotational uh as you increase in

321
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,760
temperature also the vibrational become

322
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,959
important and if you go even higher also

323
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,520
electronic uh you can excite the

324
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,120
electrons and therefore they could jump

325
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,520
uh up and down from the various uh

326
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,080
orbitals that represent the energy

327
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,679
levels of of the

328
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,840
molecule

329
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:43,640
so if uh therefore there is a kinetic

330
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,960
energy first of

331
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,679
all we this we we've seen that there is

332
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,440
there are collisions so molecules by

333
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,039
having kinetic energy uh undergo uh a

334
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,120
lot of

335
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,600
collisions and as a result of these

336
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,880
collisions they put put together their

337
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,960
kinetic energy and they form um these uh

338
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,880
activated complexes sometimes sometimes

339
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,240
they don't form the activated compx

340
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,080
sometimes they just jump uh on the sides

341
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,919
of the of the valleys which have higher

342
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:24,760
energy but then they they they go back

343
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,760
so they they bounce in the valley up in

344
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,320
these higher

345
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,799
Energies so the result of collision may

346
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,080
be the formation of things that look

347
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,640
like almost activated complexes but

348
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:42,159
they're not uh this particular one uh or

349
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,280
things in this area that would allow

350
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,840
going from from reactants to products

351
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,840
and vice

352
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,880
versa

353
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:02,200
okay and also we've seen that uh

354
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:05,559
as a result of collision the kinetic

355
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:10,320
energy gets momentarily transformed into

356
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:11,360
um elastic uh uh energy like two Springs

357
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,039
that

358
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:19,000
Collide uh so they store the energy for

359
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,960
a while and then they explode back and

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,400
and uh

361
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:30,960
and shoot the fragments of of of the

362
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,200
fishion of these um uh activated complex

363
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,480
in in various directions these fragments

364
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:42,039
will will have a a higher energy than

365
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,280
the neighbors and therefore by the other

366
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,120
collisions the non-chemical collisions

367
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:51,240
that energy will get redistributed and

368
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,880
we it will either heat up if they have

369
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,159
higher energies but sometimes it also

370
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,760
they also have lower energies because

371
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:03,200
some of the energy uh if the the

372
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:06,200
reaction has been uh effective uh have

373
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,039
uh has been um

374
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,240
uh retained by the new configuration of

375
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,799
the molecule as in the form of of

376
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,159
potential

377
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:20,679
energy like like here so if you

378
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,880
go uh from

379
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:30,240
here to this in this direction so from

380
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:34,200
left to right here uh this potential

381
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,919
energy uh is stored in the new

382
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,360
configuration so it came from kinetic

383
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:44,280
energy went up to form this complex then

384
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,880
as you go down you release so this this

385
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,080
difference from here to here will be the

386
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,559
kinetic energy that is released by The

387
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,159
fragments of the explosion so to speak

388
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,159
and uh whereas this other difference is

389
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,159
not anymore available as kinetic energy

390
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
because it do become potential

391
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,280
energy now the

392
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,880
um

393
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:23,480
collisions are governed as you know

394
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,480
by the Maxwell bolman distribution of

395
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,520
velocities uh this this distribution

396
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,240
[Music]

397
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,000
uh

398
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:43,279
maybe later on if I have time I'll I'll

399
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:51,320
show you uh how it uh can be

400
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:51,320
derived from the maximum entropy uh

401
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,320
principle so it is the distribution that

402
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,320
maximizes the entropy given certain uh

403
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,320
constraints

404
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,760
and

405
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,679
U so that means that the these

406
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:17,320
molecules do not all have the same

407
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:21,679
velocity okay and also this nice GIF

408
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,400
that I took from Wikipedia uh shows uh

409
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,840
it starts if you look it um carefully it

410
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,320
starts from a non-equilibrium situation

411
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,360
in which there are some particles that

412
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,400
are

413
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,279
that have higher velocities than other

414
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,360
so it's a

415
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:40,720
skewed slightly skewed distribution and

416
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,279
it shows how quickly it will the many

417
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:49,120
collisions will redistribute and return

418
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,120
the distribution uh back to uh Maxwell

419
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:57,039
B this is to uh to this is like

420
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,960
a victorial representation of of the

421
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,799
idea

422
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,720
that non-chemical

423
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:10,279
collisions is a fast Dynamics because

424
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:14,120
collisions are many and uh and occur

425
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:16,679
many more than than chemical ones and

426
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,559
therefore you can assume that this

427
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,000
distribution is almost uh

428
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,240
immediately uh uh returns almost

429
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,640
immediately to

430
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:32,600
maxan uh after each chemical reaction

431
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,600
has released or absorb some local

432
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:46,520
energy so now let's go back to

433
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,760
this uh path from the reactants uh from

434
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,600
the bottom of the reactants Valley to

435
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,480
the activated complex the sdle point to

436
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,840
the bottom of the uh products

437
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,120
Valley and here on the side

438
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,520
I have

439
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:09,000
drawn not exactly the Maxwell bolman

440
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:12,000
distribution but a distribution that uh

441
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,039
can be obtained from the Maxwell

442
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,799
balsman H and it is the distribution of

443
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:21,159
the kinetic energy that is made

444
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,159
available upon Collision

445
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,120
uh because what we need in order to

446
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,120
climb this diagram here this valet to go

447
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,440
to the sdle point we need enough energy

448
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,399
for the

449
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,760
Collision as a result of a

450
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,960
collision and so

451
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,399
this

452
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:48,679
curve U represents the probability

453
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:54,600
density function not for velocity but

454
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:57,120
for kinetic energy of particles in in in

455
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,320
a from the Maxwell balsman distribution

456
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,320
of velocity

457
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,240
so as a function of kinetic energy which

458
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,520
is plotted this

459
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,200
way that's the

460
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,200
PDF in order

461
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,520
for a chemical

462
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,840
uh Collision to be

463
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,480
effective we need that it has at least

464
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:28,600
this much kinetic energy so as to climb

465
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:31,159
up here so all the collisions that have

466
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:36,120
energies above

467
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:38,600
that are good so if you do this the the

468
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,039
area under the this probability

469
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,840
distribution function which is the

470
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,840
integral from this energy to

471
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,200
Infinity

472
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,440
that's uh the overall

473
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,039
probability that your Collision as a

474
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,240
kinetic energy higher than this value

475
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,240
Delta

476
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,240
H so the that's the result of the

477
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:12,120
integral so if on this side I need that

478
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,919
to be um therefore the the kinetic

479
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,880
energy that I need is the

480
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:22,279
um

481
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:25,679
enthalpy of the uh forward reaction or

482
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:30,240
forward half reaction of formation of

483
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,240
the activated complex from the reactant

484
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,039
on the other

485
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,880
side I start

486
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:40,000
lower I'm in the same box so to speak so

487
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,880
the molecules are in the same mixture

488
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,960
same maxion distribution same

489
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,440
temperature so this curve is the same as

490
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,760
that one only that it starts below

491
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,399
here

492
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,559
therefore uh if I want to form to form

493
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,360
the activated complex from this side I

494
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,640
need this much energy the enthalpy of

495
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,760
reaction of the

496
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:12,480
backward half

497
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:15,799
reaction and and so the probability to

498
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:20,399
have the necessary uh energy as a result

499
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:24,000
of the Collision is this one this area

500
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,640
which is equal to this uh exponential

501
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,679
formula and this exponential formula is

502
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,679
uh what is called the arous

503
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,559
law and of course from this side it's

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,240
smaller so there is more probability to

505
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:45,960
get up here from the reactants than from

506
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,960
the products in this case

507
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,880
because

508
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,600
uh because the because the because of

509
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,360
the because the Delta h plus is smaller

510
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,159
than the Delta Delta H minus okay so

511
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,279
this is one of the

512
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:09,960
ingredients in order to uh

513
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:13,640
formulate a a theory or a

514
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,880
model for the rate of U chemical

515
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,559
reactions for the rate at which chemical

516
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,360
reactions

517
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,159
proceed and in our language therefore

518
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,760
it's for the rate at which the reaction

519
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:33,240
coordinate changes with time I Epsilon

520
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:38,480
dot so the bottom line is is here

521
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:43,399
Epsilon dot will turn out to be the net

522
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:46,519
result of how many of of the Epsilon dot

523
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:51,440
of the forward half reaction and the

524
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:51,440
Epsilon dot of the backward half

525
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,200
reaction and these

526
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:01,039
ones are done in here so this column

527
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,320
does the half reaction this column does

528
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:08,519
uh the forward and this does the

529
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,960
backward so we talked about we can view

530
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,120
this thing in terms of this uh in terms

531
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,360
of

532
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,960
probabilities so the

533
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,720
arenus formula gives us as we've

534
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,039
discussed the probability to have enough

535
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,159
Collision enough ktic energy from the

536
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,760
Collision so that uh we form the

537
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,760
activated complex

538
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,440
then we need another

539
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,720
probability once I have the activated

540
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,519
complex which is that Springs that are

541
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,399
or compressed

542
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:49,720
and short leave and ready to explode the

543
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,720
the question is will it explode towards

544
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,080
the reactant Valley or towards the

545
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,080
product Valley

546
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,760
that depends also on how the molecules

547
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:06,480
have collided it's not just kinetic

548
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,679
energy it is also the angles with which

549
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,559
they Collide that might makes is

550
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,840
important because that

551
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:21,240
uh allows to have uh the right

552
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,679
vibrations uh vibrational modes to be uh

553
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,480
triggered and and and and therefore form

554
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,240
the new

555
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,120
configurations so it's so it is complex

556
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:39,840
uh reasoning about that it's not simple

557
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,840
to make theory about this part of

558
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,120
the of the

559
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,559
probability and therefore you just say

560
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:52,080
all right let's call it a

561
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:55,799
probability let's call it um a and there

562
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,320
is one for the forward and one for the

563
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:01,799
uh backward

564
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,639
but then you also need

565
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,639
uh

566
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:06,639
another

567
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:12,559
uh situation to occur that it's not

568
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,480
enough that the particles have the

569
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,080
proper kinetic energy but you need the

570
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,679
right particles to

571
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,480
collide I need for example uh two

572
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,159
hydrogens and maybe something else so

573
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,639
there'll be a three body reaction so

574
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,960
because if I have collision with the

575
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:35,720
right energy but the wrong molecules

576
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:40,120
that's useless okay so you remember

577
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:44,120
that the probability to have a molecule

578
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,559
uh in a mixture uh is the mole

579
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,039
fraction a nice number between zero and

580
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,360
one which represents how many you have

581
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,639
and so the chance that you have those

582
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,440
molecules is uh is the probability and

583
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:59,919
the chance that you have a uh

584
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,600
several of

585
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,600
them it's the multiplication of the

586
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,600
probabilities and if I did if I

587
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,519
need two molecules of the same kind then

588
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,039
that probability counts

589
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,880
twice so it's the mole fraction to the

590
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,519
power

591
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,679
two and those amounts are precisely what

592
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,240
these doomric coefficients are so that

593
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,720
is why this product is a product of

594
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,120
probability and the exponents the

595
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,600
stochiometric coefficients which count

596
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,720
properly how many times you need that

597
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,519
kind of molecule to be present in a

598
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,559
collision most of the times effectively

599
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,960
the most probable collisions are two

600
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:48,799
body just two molecules that Collide

601
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,440
already the three body reactions are

602
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,720
much fewer and going four and and so on

603
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,720
it's almost

604
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,600
irrelevant so so this is is a bit

605
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,919
hypothetical

606
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,440
U again it's uh that colleague of mine

607
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,880
would call it

608
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,880
Disneyland uh

609
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,880
but for a theory that's that's uh

610
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,960
okay for the practice it

611
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,320
means that you will never going to work

612
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,279
with an overall chemical reactions

613
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,760
scheme but you will split the chemical

614
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,159
reaction in many uh steps so that is why

615
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,360
we need so many reactions like we will

616
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:43,120
see again in the hydrogen will be 24

617
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,320
reactions just for the oxidation of of

618
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,639
hydrogen it's not just one

619
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:54,200
reaction and those uh detailed kinetic

620
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:56,519
schemes are mostly done with uh two body

621
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,399
or three body

622
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,399
reactions okay okay well

623
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,679
anyway these are

624
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,840
probabilities we assume they are

625
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,000
independent events so we can multiply

626
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,000
the

627
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,919
probabilities and uh yeah we can also

628
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,639
rewrite the mole fractions because here

629
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,960
we want to write it in terms of uh the

630
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,200
concentration so the mole fractions can

631
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,200
be written in terms of

632
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,200
concentrations so we multiply this that

633
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:36,159
and that that and we say all right we

634
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:40,200
assume that the rate of uh change of the

635
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,440
forward half reaction uh is given by the

636
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,399
product of these

637
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,399
probabilities and this is the formula

638
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,399
this is the

639
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,240
multiplication and then the traditional

640
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,040
naming is uh

641
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,720
that yes you have this product of

642
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,440
concentrations to to the stochiometric

643
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,680
coefficients

644
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,660
that's singled out and the preactor of

645
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,920
that is called

646
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,440
[Music]

647
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,839
reaction the rate

648
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,119
constant which is not really a constant

649
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,119
again it's a function of

650
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,000
temperature and it is an arous Factor

651
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,800
times a preactor

652
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,880
here clearly what I've done for the

653
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,800
forward I can do also for the backward

654
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,400
so you just change the minus the pluses

655
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:36,760
into minuses and you get the backward uh

656
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,800
rate of course the arus here is the

657
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:43,240
arous um term that uh is important for

658
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,960
the kinetic

659
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,440
energy and here are the

660
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,720
concentrations based on the

661
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,319
uh backward Co static coefficients so in

662
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,760
the end the net

663
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:01,480
reaction rate will be the difference

664
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,200
between the forward and the backwards

665
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,560
and when we are at equilibrium they will

666
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,720
be equal to zero I'm sorry not equal to

667
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,720
they will be equal to one

668
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,720
another

669
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,079
okay notice also here just we need to

670
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,200
remind it later on that the way we have

671
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,720
defined

672
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,680
the half

673
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,280
reactions these stochiometric

674
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:40,040
coefficients with the plus and with the

675
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,040
minus are positive

676
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,240
numbers

677
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:56,200
okay and they are related to

678
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:58,520
the uh overall reaction stochiometric

679
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,599
coefficients in the this

680
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,280
way the one of the backward minus the

681
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,079
one of the forward at least according to

682
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,160
our convention that puts everything on

683
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,599
the left hand side and with a plus with

684
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,599
a positive stomry coefficients for what

685
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,560
we call the

686
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,200
products of course you can always switch

687
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,800
a a point of view and call what the pro

688
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,760
the products call them reactants and

689
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,760
then you'll you'll change the all the

690
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,760
signs

691
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,839
okay so for example here is

692
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,640
the uh rate

693
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,960
constants for the set of 24

694
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,240
reactions that we already uh mentioned

695
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,599
that

696
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,040
does uh that is

697
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:00,040
the most

698
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,800
trusted uh detailed kinetic kinetic

699
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:06,160
scheme for the oxidation of hydrogen in

700
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,160
pure

701
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,800
oxygen as you

702
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:15,599
see uh here they are

703
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,839
listed um from number

704
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,640
11 to

705
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,119
24 they are two body reactions you see

706
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,119
in both sides you have two

707
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:30,599
molecules so so in order for this

708
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,920
reaction to form its activated complex

709
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:38,079
you have to have a collision of an

710
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,599
oxygen atom and a hydrogen

711
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,000
molecule and if it is effective that

712
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:47,119
will form a hydrogen atom and an

713
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,440
O and here

714
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,800
is the

715
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,520
prefactor actually the preactor what we

716
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,040
call the a of T now here it is written

717
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,040
as a

718
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,839
constant times

719
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:06,520
T to a power and B this is the power of

720
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:12,040
the temperature these are experimental

721
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:16,040
values and the activated the activation

722
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,040
um uh energy so the

723
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,000
arous threshold is listed here

724
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,720
it is also not worthy that this the U

725
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,160
three body reactions instead you see on

726
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:42,920
the first 11 first 10

727
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:46,040
reactions have three require three

728
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,520
bodies three body collisions on either

729
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:52,920
one side or the other or both like no

730
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,920
just one side or the

731
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,880
other and they represented with zero

732
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,880
activation

733
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:08,440
energy

734
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,400
okay we'll actually have later on

735
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,000
hopefully today another example in which

736
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,560
this list of reactions will will be

737
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,560
analyzed

738
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,119
somehow

739
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,599
now let's see what are the consequences

740
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,280
of this model that we have uh developed

741
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,800
so

742
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,640
we just said we want to represent the

743
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,200
reaction rates this

744
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,680
way forward and

745
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:44,160
backward notice that all the

746
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,319
ingredients are positive because they

747
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,800
after all it's a product of

748
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:49,520
probabilities and you cannot have

749
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,079
negative probabilities so so these are

750
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,640
both positive Epsilon plus and Epsilon

751
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,640
minus are are positive

752
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,599
remember also that we defined and we

753
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,040
just recalled the non-e equilibrium law

754
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,040
of mass

755
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,520
action

756
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:22,200
okay so let's now compute the

757
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,880
ratio between the uh backward and the

758
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:29,119
forward reaction

759
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,720
right so we substitute from up

760
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,880
there we

761
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,440
notice that this product on the

762
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,040
numerator and the denominator you can

763
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,280
also write since

764
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:46,040
the the the argument of the exponent are

765
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:51,000
the same you can also write it as n i to

766
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:54,440
the uh new minus minus new plus that's n

767
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,240
to the uh new to the stochiometric

768
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,280
coefficient of the overall reaction so

769
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,359
you can make this

770
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,200
step and then we can substitute from the

771
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:06,599
non equilibrium law of mass action which

772
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,040
because this is valid

773
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:15,040
always and you get this expression

774
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:18,839
here now this expression here is General

775
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,240
at least given this kind of modeling for

776
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:22,960
the

777
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,760
kinetics is General therefore it applies

778
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,319
also at equilibrium so also when the um

779
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,839
a is equal to

780
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,400
zero so when the Affinity is equal to

781
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:39,240
zero this e to the 0 is

782
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,000
one and also at

783
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,760
equilibrium the rate of the backward is

784
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,400
equal to the rate to of the forward they

785
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,960
are not zero but they are equal to one

786
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,960
another so it's a sort of a dynamic

787
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:01,800
equilibrium so this is one and also so

788
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:06,599
the left hand side is one at

789
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:08,119
equilibrium and so that gives us a

790
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,559
relation

791
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:17,880
between uh the backward forward react U

792
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,880
right constants and the equilibrium

793
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,559
constant this is called the principle of

794
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,559
detailed balance

795
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,160
it's useful

796
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,800
because you don't as you have seen for

797
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,200
example didn't mention that but uh uh in

798
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,000
the list for the that I gave for the for

799
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,720
the hydrogen

800
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,960
rates uh we gave only the

801
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,960
k+ the

802
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:54,079
forward yes that's because uh from the

803
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,000
equilibrium constant which which you can

804
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,720
compute from the thermodynamic

805
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,319
properties like gives free energy of the

806
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:07,079
reaction you given the the forward rate

807
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:12,520
you can compute using this uh principle

808
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,520
uh the backward right so they're not

809
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:23,520
independent that means I can uh say well

810
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,559
that means that this combination here

811
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,760
this prefactor of the exponent is equal

812
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:28,760
to one

813
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,440
okay and so in general I obtain that the

814
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,559
ratio of

815
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:43,480
the backward to the forward

816
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:46,680
rate is equal to e to the minus the

817
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,680
Affinity over the gas

818
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:57,480
constant if you take the logarithm of

819
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,640
that or actually if you take the

820
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,319
logarithm of the inverse of that so the

821
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,640
logarithm of the

822
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:05,559
forward to the

823
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,880
negative uh

824
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:12,119
right which by this formula is equal

825
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:15,160
therefore to the Affinity divided by R

826
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,800
uh we typically call that the degree of

827
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,079
this equilibrium of the

828
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,119
reaction so in other words it's another

829
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:24,800
way of so you can call it Affinity but

830
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,720
you also call it degree of thise

831
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,359
equilibrium

832
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,200
and it's related to

833
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,040
this

834
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,480
ratio clearly when the ratio is equal to

835
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,119
one at equilibrium the logarithm is zero

836
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,920
and the degree of this equilibrium is

837
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,960
zero and the degree of this equilibrium

838
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,480
can

839
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,480
be positive and

840
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,640
negative okay so let's turn for example

841
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,960
to to

842
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,200
um uh other results that follow from

843
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,480
that what you you just

844
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:13,960
seen think of the energy balance for a

845
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:16,200
system in which uh for an isolated box

846
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,079
in which there are chemical reactions

847
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:23,559
going on but there are no

848
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:27,359
exchanges of energy uh or particles with

849
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,359
the outside

850
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:37,040
nor entropy also so uh the rate of

851
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:40,480
entropy change is equal only to the rate

852
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,480
of entropy produced by

853
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,640
irreversibility now the rate of entropy

854
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:51,240
change it's the partial of the entropy

855
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:53,200
with respect to time now in that

856
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,319
scenario for the model that we have

857
00:46:53,200 --> 00:47:01,720
given uh we just reviewed in ear slides

858
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:04,640
today uh the expression for the

859
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,240
entropy in our model in our simple

860
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,880
system model it's a function of many

861
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:13,599
things including the uh the epsilons the

862
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,960
reaction coordinates if the epsilons are

863
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:20,000
the only things that change with time

864
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,119
because the energy the volume and

865
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,800
everything else is is

866
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,040
fixed then the rate of change of the

867
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,839
entropy is the partial of s with with

868
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,359
respect to Epsilon time

869
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,040
Epsilon uh dot but the partial of s with

870
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,760
respect to Epsilon is the

871
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,319
Affinity so we have this expression

872
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,520
here and if the since the system is

873
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:47,920
isolated that also represents the

874
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,920
entropy produced by

875
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:54,200
irreversibility and uh it better be non-

876
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,680
negative in fact

877
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,720
if you write Epsilon dot like we have

878
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,000
written

879
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:08,200
as plus minus do

880
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,920
minus multiplies by the Affinity if you

881
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:14,520
remember that the Affinity we just

882
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,200
defined it as equal to we've not defined

883
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,559
we just discovered that it is equal

884
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:24,400
to R

885
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,400
times uh the degree of this

886
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,400
equilibrium we get this expression which

887
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,200
gives us the rate of entropy change

888
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,440
which has to be equal to the rate of

889
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,040
entropy produced by irreversibility for

890
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:44,240
the Clos system for the isolated system

891
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:46,200
and this one in fact is a combination of

892
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,240
of of numbers that is

893
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:54,559
always uh positive you can find that for

894
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,559
any X and Y

895
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:02,160
uh you have this

896
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:14,520
inequality all right so at least we are

897
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,440
happy that um we are not violating U the

898
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,240
principle of entropy non decrease and

899
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,760
therefore we accept this model as a

900
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,599
reasonable one otherwise people would

901
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,599
not be using

902
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:34,079
it we can also look at this expression

903
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:37,440
here and notice that we could

904
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,559
call see so the the contribution of to

905
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,520
the entropy change or the entropy

906
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,880
production in this for the close system

907
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,240
of the isolated system

908
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,680
is as a positive term and a negative

909
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,599
term or at least a term with a plus sign

910
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:57,280
and term with a minus

911
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,319
sign so and actually since

912
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,680
we said that these Epsilon pluses and

913
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:04,799
minuses are always

914
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:07,359
positive whereas the Affinity can be

915
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:07,359
positive or

916
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:14,400
negative all right so what we do we call

917
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,680
these two contributions this way we call

918
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:21,599
it s+ s do plus and S do

919
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:25,440
minus so we rewrite that expression for

920
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:28,440
the entropy change as s do+ minus s do

921
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,440
minus

922
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,520
of course you've we've we've we've not

923
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,760
we've noticed here that the these

924
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:46,240
results in always being uh

925
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,040
positive

926
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:53,720
but sometimes it's

927
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:58,280
positive because uh s+ is greater than S

928
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:03,839
minus but sometimes it's positive

929
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,839
because s minus is more negative than

930
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:13,599
s+ in fact we

931
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:17,200
can by this definition we see that s

932
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:19,520
minus over s+ is also equal to the ratio

933
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,040
of the forward so it's essentially

934
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,400
related to the degree of this

935
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,720
equilibrium of the overall reaction or

936
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,559
you could also take it as the ratio of

937
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:33,400
the exponentials of the degrees of the

938
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:36,400
this equilibrium of the

939
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,400
half

940
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:47,760
reactions expressions of this

941
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:52,000
sort have in the recent uh literature

942
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,559
let's say 15 years been called

943
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,520
fluctuation

944
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:58,520
relations there are many of these sort

945
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,079
and here essentially you see that the

946
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,720
the degree of this

947
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,559
equilibrium

948
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:16,440
governs the

949
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:19,839
probability that

950
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:24,160
uh these number be

951
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:28,240
uh greater or smaller than

952
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:32,200
one and sometimes

953
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,520
if people push a bit too much the

954
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,359
interpretation they say all right this

955
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:41,480
is H this is a process that goes against

956
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:45,079
the second law this one goes uh towards

957
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:48,400
the second law but the net balance never

958
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:52,200
violat so it's like saying well one is a

959
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,200
is is is more unusual than the other but

960
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:58,440
if for the second LW what counts is the

961
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,440
overall net

962
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,920
effect and here is the list of

963
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,880
possibilities if you want that to be

964
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:13,200
greater than zero which is uh

965
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,599
always uh if you

966
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,359
have a

967
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:22,319
positive Affinity so a positive degree

968
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:24,359
of uh these

969
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:27,040
equilibrium

970
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:31,119
uh then uh

971
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:34,200
this is the case in which the s+ is more

972
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:36,839
positive than the S

973
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,359
minus or if you have the Affinity

974
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,880
negative or the degree of this

975
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:43,720
equilibrium negative this is the case in

976
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,880
which the S minus is more negative than

977
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:50,920
the S Plus and of course at equilibrium

978
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,920
they're both equal to zero

979
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,799
there is another

980
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,760
way of getting to the same result to the

981
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,520
same

982
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:16,240
kinetic

983
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,240
theory theory of of of chemical

984
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:22,920
kinetics and this is a model based on

985
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,920
equilibrium

986
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:30,960
considerations so let's start

987
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:34,200
from the overall reaction that we are

988
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,200
studying like this

989
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,720
one for

990
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:44,280
which we recall what the definition of

991
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:48,440
the Affinity is it's the weighted sum of

992
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:51,440
minus mu / T of the various

993
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,440
chemical

994
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:57,599
potentials and

995
00:54:53,599 --> 00:55:00,440
here is the law of mass action

996
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,160
the non equilibrium low of

997
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,880
massage

998
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,319
now let's consider also the half

999
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,440
reactions of formation now here for see

1000
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:14,599
for compactness I put I call them plus

1001
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,760
and minus so this represents two

1002
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:19,559
reactions that the half forward and the

1003
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,319
half

1004
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:25,440
backward of formation so they are also

1005
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,280
written in that same format with

1006
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,480
everything to the to the left of the

1007
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,640
equal

1008
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,640
sign so that's the activated

1009
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:40,599
complex this being a reaction as any

1010
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:44,440
other I can Define its affinities so I

1011
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:46,720
can Define the Affinity Plus or the

1012
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,839
Affinity of the minus reaction I have to

1013
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,039
be careful that the tetric coefficients

1014
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:55,760
are not only these ones but also there

1015
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,280
is a sotic coefficient equal to one in

1016
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,200
front of of the activated complex so

1017
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:05,160
that's this contribution so I need to

1018
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:10,000
know or at least to uh in theoretically

1019
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:14,359
assume that we are able to uh uh know

1020
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,520
the chemical potential of the activated

1021
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:20,960
complex whereas these are the usual ones

1022
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,400
I mean those are the reactants and the

1023
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,240
uh

1024
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:29,200
products and

1025
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:32,000
clearly Al for this reaction I can write

1026
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,760
a a non equilibrium low of mass action

1027
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,280
exactly like that one only using

1028
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,280
properly these doomric

1029
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:44,280
coefficients this the the concentration

1030
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,839
of the activated complex goes on top

1031
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,160
because it has a plus stochiometric

1032
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:52,440
coefficient and this

1033
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:54,920
summation uh I put it at the denominator

1034
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,760
because otherwise I would have to put it

1035
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:03,240
at the numerator with minus uh new plus

1036
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:07,240
minus okay so that's and clearly uh I

1037
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,039
also need to compute a an equilibrium

1038
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,799
constant for the forward and for the

1039
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:17,599
backward reaction all right so that's

1040
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:20,400
that's uh pretty General know not

1041
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,400
assumptions so

1042
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:29,680
far we can also compute therefore

1043
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,680
the

1044
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:36,480
equilibrium now here's the trick we we

1045
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:40,319
are going to

1046
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:43,319
assume equilibrium partial equilibrium

1047
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:46,520
only either for the forward or for the

1048
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:48,480
backward reaction so we say all right

1049
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:52,520
suppose

1050
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:54,640
uh the backward reaction is at

1051
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,839
equilibrium we set the it's Affinity

1052
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,039
equal to zero

1053
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:02,039
and from this law of mass action this

1054
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,200
becomes one and we

1055
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:08,000
compute what would

1056
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:10,839
be the concentration of the activated

1057
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,680
complex if it were in equilibrium with

1058
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:14,559
the

1059
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,880
reactants only I'm sorry with the

1060
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,200
product because that's the backward

1061
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,799
reaction so only on that side of the

1062
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:26,720
valley there is equilibrium and that

1063
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:29,400
gives me n star uh minus

1064
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:33,839
I do the same also on the other side and

1065
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,839
that would give me another value for the

1066
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,520
concentration the actual concentration

1067
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,319
of the activated complex is related to

1068
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,839
those

1069
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:51,599
ones through the degrees of this

1070
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:56,520
equilibrium of the forward and backward

1071
00:58:51,599 --> 00:59:00,480
reactions because uh I can simply uh

1072
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:03,039
recognize that this K and this summation

1073
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:09,160
appear up here so if I substitute these

1074
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:09,160
two in here it it brings me uh this

1075
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:18,359
relation I also noticed that the ratio

1076
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:20,359
between what would be uh the equilibrium

1077
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:23,559
concentration of the activated

1078
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:26,640
complex uh for the minus or for the plus

1079
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:29,880
the ratio of the two is equal to

1080
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,160
again the degree of the

1081
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,480
equ or the exponential of the degree of

1082
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,920
so the degree of the equilibrium can be

1083
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:42,960
written also therefore as the logarithm

1084
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,960
of those would be

1085
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:47,359
concentrations meaning that at

1086
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:50,000
equilibrium those

1087
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:54,000
concentrations are equal if if they are

1088
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,799
both uh that overall equilibrium so

1089
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,359
equilibrium for the overall action

1090
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:04,039
then

1091
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:04,039
also uh the forward and the backward are

1092
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:11,079
at so the idea is all right so that

1093
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,480
means

1094
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:18,480
that I have an indicator which is

1095
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,480
this

1096
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:26,000
ratio of the

1097
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,760
unbalance can think of this equilibrium

1098
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,640
concentrations as the um the sort of the

1099
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:36,319
rate at which the reactants form the

1100
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,079
activated complex and if that rate those

1101
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,640
rates are unbalanced there is more

1102
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,039
formation of activated complex from one

1103
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,200
side and from the other and therefore

1104
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:49,520
there is more chance uh that the

1105
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:52,039
reaction proceeds uh in order to balance

1106
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:58,440
this that is

1107
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:58,440
why we can assume that the reaction uh

1108
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:04,839
rate the of the forward reaction of of

1109
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:07,839
the forward is equal to the forward

1110
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:10,400
equilibrium of the activated complex

1111
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:13,799
times a a coefficient which represents

1112
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:18,520
the uh the frequency with

1113
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:21,280
which uh the activated complex decays in

1114
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,280
the forward

1115
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:28,039
Direction and conversely for the minus

1116
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:30,799
so that is the

1117
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:35,359
Assumption and with that

1118
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:40,839
assumption we get if you substitute this

1119
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:46,319
equilibrium expression you get

1120
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:48,520
this U formula which is very similar to

1121
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,480
uh it has some something that depends on

1122
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,000
temperature which is still what we

1123
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,920
called the the rate constant so it's

1124
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,839
another way of writing the rate constant

1125
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,839
essentially

1126
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,279
from a different

1127
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:10,000
reasoning not in terms of probabilities

1128
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:10,000
but in terms of

1129
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,960
equilibrium

1130
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:22,039
and of course we can apply we we can do

1131
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,640
the same as same ratio that we did in

1132
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:27,640
order to compute the principle of detail

1133
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,640
balance

1134
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:34,880
at so this is in general if you evaluate

1135
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,920
this at equilibrium when Epsilon minus

1136
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,400
and plus are equal and they are equal to

1137
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:44,720
epsilon0 so this is equal to

1138
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:47,400
one the Affinity is equal to uh zero so

1139
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:50,039
e is equal to one

1140
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,599
that

1141
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:55,599
implies that K minus must be equal to k+

1142
01:02:53,599 --> 01:03:01,119
so that this frequency of forward and

1143
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:01,119
back or Decay is equal on both

1144
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,160
sides

1145
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:10,799
symmetrical which which which gives us

1146
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:10,799
some nice uh

1147
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:18,079
uh understanding of so we could have

1148
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,079
used here a single a single

1149
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,400
K and

1150
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:25,760
therefore you see that uh these forward

1151
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:29,680
and backward reactions are propor

1152
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:33,000
portional by the same constant uh to

1153
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:36,599
these would be concentrations of the uh

1154
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,599
activated complexes

1155
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,359
let's return to the rate of entropy

1156
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,480
production

1157
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:13,200
and this

1158
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,799
is for the case in which we did it

1159
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:19,760
before for the case in which we have

1160
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:22,960
only one chemical

1161
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,839
reaction most of the times we have many

1162
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:29,960
chemical reactions

1163
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:32,359
like the 24 for hydrogen or the 350 for

1164
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,920
methane and so

1165
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:36,880
on

1166
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,680
so we don't have only one Epsilon we

1167
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,599
have many epsilons and Z is the number

1168
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,599
of

1169
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,240
reactions so the rate of change for the

1170
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:49,400
entropy which for the for the isolated

1171
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:52,520
system is also the entropy produced by

1172
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:55,319
reversibility is a

1173
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:58,240
summation of affinities each multiplied

1174
01:04:55,319 --> 01:05:00,880
by each right which we can write also in

1175
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,880
this Vector

1176
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,200
form now

1177
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,640
here

1178
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,440
sometimes uh we

1179
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:19,880
realize

1180
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:22,960
that uh not all reactions have the

1181
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:27,720
are are important in the same in the

1182
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,520
sense that U uh we need to describe

1183
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:33,079
their

1184
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:33,079
kinetics because some reactions are so

1185
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,119
fast

1186
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:41,680
that regardless of the kinetics they go

1187
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,279
they

1188
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:47,559
equilibrate very

1189
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:52,039
quickly so we

1190
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:56,559
can save ourself some time or

1191
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:59,319
complication if we assume that they are

1192
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:03,880
at equilibrium so essentially what we do

1193
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:06,880
is to split the set of Z reactions into

1194
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,319
a set of slow and a set of fast

1195
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,079
reactions so I split the summation into

1196
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:12,079
two

1197
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,200
summations of

1198
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:22,240
course the proportionality relation is

1199
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:27,200
this one it's also a summation so uh the

1200
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,200
we have split the summation also in here

1201
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:36,160
and the this law means

1202
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:38,200
that we can assume that this part of the

1203
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,760
composition is slowly

1204
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:44,520
varing as compared to this contribution

1205
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,520
here of the fast

1206
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,079
reactions and then we

1207
01:06:52,319 --> 01:07:00,839
assume that the Epsilon of the fast

1208
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:03,319
reactions are at any instant of

1209
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:06,359
time the equilibrium

1210
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:12,520
epsilons so we use the law of mass

1211
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:12,520
action to compute the equilibrium

1212
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:19,319
composition only of the subset of fast

1213
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,119
reactions assuming that the slow ones

1214
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:22,799
are

1215
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:26,240
frozen we temporarily

1216
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:31,000
froze freeze the uh uh the slow

1217
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:34,359
reactions so that fixes this part of the

1218
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,039
composition and we say all

1219
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:40,880
right for this so these become the

1220
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,880
initial amounts like the

1221
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,960
N uh so the for these initial amounts

1222
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,520
what would

1223
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:52,240
be the equilibrium

1224
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:55,200
composition for the stomri efficients of

1225
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,039
the fast reactions and that's what we've

1226
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,279
been doing we apply the law of mass

1227
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:06,039
action in order to compute uh uh

1228
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:11,279
compositions which can be cast as uh

1229
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:11,279
values of the reaction rates the Epsilon

1230
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:18,600
zeros

1231
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:21,560
right of course this has to be done at

1232
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:24,440
every instant of time because

1233
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:26,679
slowly uh the slow reactions do Advance

1234
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:29,199
Al They also advance

1235
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:30,719
actually they are the the bottleneck of

1236
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:33,880
the mechanism they are the rate

1237
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:36,279
controlling reactions the slow ones are

1238
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,120
the ones that control the rate of the

1239
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:45,520
others now like when you have a a car

1240
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:48,560
Jam uh the low U cars ahead um impede

1241
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,679
the the ones behind to go faster even if

1242
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,000
they are faster but they can as soon as

1243
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:56,880
they get there they they get stuck okay

1244
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:01,640
so essentially this is is what the fast

1245
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,440
reaction do they get stuck uh in Q of

1246
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:07,080
they wait for the slow reactions to

1247
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,080
change something and then immediately

1248
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:16,080
adapt

1249
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:18,600
okay so you may say Ah that's

1250
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,120
interesting so but if the reactions the

1251
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,880
fast

1252
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:26,960
reactions are at equilibrium it means

1253
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:30,319
that their affinities are equal to zero

1254
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:32,759
so in the expression for the entropy

1255
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:35,600
change the affinities of the fast

1256
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:38,440
reactions are by this model assumed to

1257
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,440
be all equal to

1258
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,960
zero which is

1259
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:49,719
true but one one might be led to

1260
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,480
conclude oh so the so the First

1261
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:55,360
Reactions don't contribute to the

1262
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:59,040
entropy production because this sum is

1263
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:01,159
equ Al to zero no that would be wrong

1264
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,719
conclusion

1265
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:08,520
because this

1266
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:11,679
assumption makes the uh epsilons of the

1267
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:16,159
fast reaction

1268
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:20,159
appear in the affinities of the low ones

1269
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:20,159
and here is

1270
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,920
um so here this says that the the

1271
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:29,920
Affinity of the fast reaction is equal

1272
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,480
to zero which is the this the the set of

1273
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,400
equations that you have to solve in

1274
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:40,440
order to compute these Epsilon zero

1275
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:42,800
fast once you find it you put it in uh

1276
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:45,400
the expression the analogous expression

1277
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,800
for the slow reactions which depend on

1278
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:52,880
energy volume and the amounts now the

1279
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:56,760
amounts are given by the proportionality

1280
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:59,199
relation here with the absolute

1281
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,640
instead of being now a function of time

1282
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:05,120
this way it is a function of time this

1283
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:07,640
way so I substitute this

1284
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,199
Epsilon with the result of the

1285
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,199
equilibrium

1286
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:17,159
computation and so now you see that uh

1287
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:20,320
the fast

1288
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:23,560
reactions advance so these Epsilon Zer

1289
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:28,560
Advance following the slow ones and

1290
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:32,280
their Advan advance changes the uh

1291
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:35,880
affects the affinities of the low

1292
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:38,440
reaction so essentially we have moved

1293
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:42,280
the effects of this summation which is

1294
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:47,880
actually fast so it's producing uh

1295
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:52,679
immediately the entropy uh so it's and

1296
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:56,800
it's it's we built it in uh the

1297
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:56,800
affinities of the slow reactions

1298
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,840
all right so with this model at least

1299
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:06,000
you

1300
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:11,400
have you you you know you find that it's

1301
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:14,679
useless to know uh the reaction uh rate

1302
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:17,080
constants so the arous factors and all

1303
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:20,280
all of that for the reactions that you

1304
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:26,280
feel are uh

1305
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:26,280
faster and therefore equili equilibrated

1306
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,840
so here's an

1307
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
example

1308
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:41,679
uh of a nozzle

1309
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:47,080
expansion so here we have

1310
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:49,760
um be at the entrance before this throat

1311
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:54,080
of the no nozzle this is a supersonic

1312
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:57,840
nozzle this uh throat has on the left

1313
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:00,000
hand side not drone here the a

1314
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,239
combustion chamber in which you have

1315
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,280
produced

1316
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:07,239
the you've burnt a hydrogen in pure

1317
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:11,199
oxygen and so you have the products of

1318
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:15,040
combustion essentially water and few

1319
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:18,400
other uh F the other eight species that

1320
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:21,679
are in that scheme that will appear

1321
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:24,800
again in the next

1322
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:27,199
slide so these products of of combustion

1323
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,480
are at an adiabatic flame temperature

1324
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,480
they are certain

1325
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:38,159
pressure about 25

1326
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:41,199
atmospheres and uh the

1327
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:43,159
throat is so designed to so as to

1328
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:46,800
achieve the maximum speed you know that

1329
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:48,920
when you have mac number uh so the sound

1330
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:53,199
when the flow is

1331
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:56,199
a Mac number equal to one that's the the

1332
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:58,679
the maximum speed allowed

1333
01:13:56,199 --> 01:14:02,239
by the combination of the entropy

1334
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:04,520
momentum and energy balance plus the

1335
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:06,199
equation of State for the

1336
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:09,600
gas

1337
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:09,600
that's fluid

1338
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:15,040
mechanics and combined with

1339
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:18,400
thermodynamics but in any case so you

1340
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:20,840
have Mac one and then as a result of the

1341
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:25,719
expansion

1342
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:28,520
here uh if you have a welld designed uh

1343
01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:30,080
nozle the fluid will accelerate and

1344
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:32,639
become

1345
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,440
supersonic example here it would exit at

1346
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:37,760
the Mac

1347
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:40,960
Four of course that means

1348
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:44,400
that uh

1349
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:48,040
the uh thermal

1350
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:52,080
energy gets transformed into kinetic

1351
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:53,840
energy so the gas cools down and also

1352
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:57,000
the pressure goes

1353
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,000
down okay

1354
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,560
this uh occurs pretty quickly because of

1355
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,520
the high

1356
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:10,159
velocities is

1357
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:13,719
expansion and uh the rapidity is

1358
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,719
important here

1359
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,239
because

1360
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:28,000
uh the time that um the collisions

1361
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:28,000
require to reequilibrate

1362
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:37,120
energy uh is not U is not is um is not

1363
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:39,679
enough given the residence the short

1364
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:43,040
residence time those

1365
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:46,320
collisions uh cannot keep

1366
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,320
up with

1367
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:53,639
equilibrium

1368
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:55,679
uh here at the entrance of the nozzle we

1369
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:57,719
have chemical equilibrium

1370
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,880
so the composition here is that of

1371
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:04,320
chemical

1372
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:06,679
equilibrium and this is the uh the

1373
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:09,600
temperature as as it

1374
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:12,880
expands you would think

1375
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:16,239
that the chemically effective collisions

1376
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:20,080
are fast enough to keep up and maintain

1377
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:22,080
chemical equilibrium if they

1378
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:25,679
did you would

1379
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:29,239
follow this blue dotted line

1380
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,239
line a dashed

1381
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:36,960
line in reality they

1382
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:41,800
follow the red

1383
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:46,040
line that's at least according to the 24

1384
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,040
reactions say species detailed chemical

1385
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,920
schin they are not completely Frozen

1386
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,480
though some reactions do occur because

1387
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:59,080
uh if you try to compute uh assume that

1388
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,520
uh the

1389
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:06,560
composition uh here Remains the Same all

1390
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:09,880
through you would do you would obtain

1391
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,239
this uh result that's when you assume

1392
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:16,480
all the reactions

1393
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:16,480
Frozen so they are not frozen they are

1394
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:25,360
active so here are

1395
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:26,520
the 24 reactions that we uh

1396
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,560
have

1397
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:32,000
seen and

1398
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,679
now we look what each one does by

1399
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,800
looking at the individual degree of this

1400
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,800
equilibrium that we have

1401
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:45,320
defined and we find something uh which

1402
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:48,679
is a bit surprising if you if

1403
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:51,239
you if you don't think a lot about

1404
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:54,120
this

1405
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:57,080
that yeah what's not surprising is that

1406
01:17:54,120 --> 01:18:00,080
you have some reactions for which the

1407
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,480
degree of this equilibrium remains

1408
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,199
practically

1409
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:06,360
zero so they remain at equilibrium these

1410
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:10,960
are the

1411
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,960
ones that are pretty

1412
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:20,320
fast and if you group them here like 11

1413
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:25,199
13 14 18 20 21 23 it's these

1414
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:25,199
ones they are two body reactions

1415
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:34,199
[Music]

1416
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,760
uh of they have certain feature this fo

1417
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:41,639
minus

1418
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:44,159
FV uh fo represents the free oxygen and

1419
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:47,840
F the free valence of the

1420
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:50,760
molecules and this difference turns out

1421
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:54,040
uh I frankly don't know why that

1422
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:57,639
particular difference I'm not uh enough

1423
01:18:54,040 --> 01:19:00,239
chemical engineer to or a chemist to

1424
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:04,239
understand that you I wish Professor kek

1425
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:04,239
was here to tell

1426
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:20,280
us what's surprising here is that there

1427
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:25,560
are other groups of reactions so the

1428
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:25,560
reactions behave like groups

1429
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:31,040
for

1430
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:34,880
example S 8 n and

1431
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:38,719
10 build up degree of this equilibrium

1432
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:42,760
so that means that the kinetics cannot

1433
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:47,040
uh keep up and therefore you build uh

1434
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:49,840
keep up with the to reach equilibrium

1435
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,840
and therefore you

1436
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:57,840
build uh dise equilibrium that's the

1437
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:57,840
degree of dis equilibrium they as you go

1438
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,800
downstreams but these four reactions

1439
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:06,600
which are very different from one

1440
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:09,440
another uh yet they follow the same uh

1441
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:11,000
the same um the

1442
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:15,159
same

1443
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,159
uh departure from from

1444
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:19,760
equilibrium and notice that these one

1445
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:21,800
are three body

1446
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:25,600
reactions these are reactions that

1447
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:29,120
require the Collision of three molecules

1448
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:32,880
they are much less frequent and that is

1449
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:35,480
why this doesn't occur fast enough to

1450
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,480
keep up with the

1451
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:43,880
equilibrium

1452
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:47,360
but they do not change the difference

1453
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,360
between free oxygen and free

1454
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:53,960
valence so essentially these

1455
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,400
reactions are subject to what we would

1456
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,800
call A

1457
01:20:55,400 --> 01:21:02,600
a bottle the same bottleneck which is

1458
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:05,480
the the three body reactions you need uh

1459
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,920
a three body reaction to for them to a

1460
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,400
three body collision and those are in

1461
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:13,960
infrequent and that is characterized by

1462
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:16,199
a change in the uh overall molecular

1463
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:17,760
number because you see you go from three

1464
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:21,560
to

1465
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:24,199
two so you you have Collision of three

1466
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,600
particles and uh after the activated

1467
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:31,040
complex

1468
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:31,040
uh breaks down it it produces two

1469
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:37,800
fragments then we have another set

1470
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:40,480
another group which is these ones these

1471
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:43,320
ones these are two body

1472
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,960
reactions but their bottleneck is that

1473
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:49,600
uh these reactions

1474
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:53,280
change this magic difference between uh

1475
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:58,560
free oxygen free Valance they change

1476
01:21:53,280 --> 01:22:01,480
them the change it by the same amount

1477
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:04,000
to that this is what they have in

1478
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:07,080
common it's the same so they have to

1479
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,520
face the same bottleneck changing that

1480
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:12,280
and apparently

1481
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:15,280
that requires

1482
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,280
probably

1483
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:23,360
uh something of of of of

1484
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:27,880
the of the mechanism that is common even

1485
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:31,480
if the molecules are different um that

1486
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:34,960
difference plays a role in the kinetics

1487
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:36,760
and it's slow it slows down so those

1488
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:41,639
cannot cannot keep

1489
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:45,080
up and then you also if you look uh long

1490
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:48,280
enough you may recognize that the this

1491
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:51,960
other group follows a curve which is the

1492
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:53,440
sum of the curves below so if you take

1493
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,440
the sum of this curve and the sum of

1494
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,440
that curve

1495
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:01,639
uh you get

1496
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,400
that so the degree of dis equilibrium of

1497
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:05,560
these ones at any instant of time is

1498
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,560
equal to the sum of the degrees of the

1499
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:11,159
equilibrium that has built up for the

1500
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,440
other two mechanism and in fact this is

1501
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:16,880
the group of reactions here that is

1502
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:20,440
subject to both bottlenecks they require

1503
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:24,679
three collisions mean three body uh

1504
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:26,760
Collision Plus they require to change uh

1505
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:30,400
the difference between free oxy and free

1506
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:33,800
valence and that's why they pay double

1507
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:37,760
duty so to speak and they remain behind

1508
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,760
by the sum of these degrees of this

1509
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:48,920
equ so the idea of um if you go back one

1510
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:52,199
moment the idea of the ra control

1511
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:55,560
constraint equilibrium model is to

1512
01:23:52,199 --> 01:24:00,080
assign instead of of using all the 24

1513
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:02,960
reaction rates uh it shows and actually

1514
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:05,360
here this shows that you get very good

1515
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:09,800
results with

1516
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:14,480
only uh uh rates for four

1517
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:17,679
constraints two are just the element

1518
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:18,960
conservation and the others are one is

1519
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,440
the number

1520
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,199
of molecules conservation which is

1521
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:27,840
conserved uh uh by the two body

1522
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:31,480
collisions and not by the three body

1523
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:34,120
collisions and the other is the that

1524
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,679
difference between the free valence and

1525
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:38,560
free

1526
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:42,119
oxygen and that means that you can

1527
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:45,840
obtain the exact match of the

1528
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:49,400
experimental results instead of solving

1529
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,880
24 right equations so you just solve 2 +

1530
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:56,080
two so that makes

1531
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:58,560
four with a big gain especially

1532
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:00,920
if you're doing if you're doing also

1533
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,679
computational fluid mechanics and

1534
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:07,400
therefore in addition to the chemical

1535
01:25:02,679 --> 01:25:11,360
kinetics you have to uh solve the the uh

1536
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:14,880
the fluid mechanics of of the problem H

1537
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:17,320
where if you uh if you have to deal with

1538
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:21,719
turbulence and so on uh makes the

1539
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:24,320
problem already complicated enough that

1540
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:25,840
Savings in the number of different

1541
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,760
differential equations you have to solve

1542
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,760
simultaneously makes a lot of a

1543
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,040
difference now this same

1544
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:44,760
idea also

1545
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:47,480
applies uh here again a nozzle you take

1546
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,480
products of

1547
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:55,320
combustion of some other

1548
01:25:52,119 --> 01:25:58,080
fuel uh so that you obtain

1549
01:25:55,320 --> 01:26:01,440
here a mixture at

1550
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:04,440
equilibrium in which you have carbon

1551
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,440
dioxide

1552
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:16,239
nitrogen and a little bit of water so

1553
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:18,400
90% nitrogen about 10% CO2 and 1% water

1554
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:22,480
water I

1555
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:27,280
think acts as a catalyzer what of the

1556
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:30,440
reactions that we're going to describe

1557
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:35,199
here now also at in this

1558
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:36,880
nozzle the important uh effect is that

1559
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:39,800
there is a degree of dise equilibrium

1560
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:42,320
that builds up like we have

1561
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:45,840
seen only that here the the dise

1562
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:49,800
equilibrium is not between molecular

1563
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:53,320
species or the certain chemical reaction

1564
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:56,560
it's within the molecules in particular

1565
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:59,440
the molecules of of

1566
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:02,760
CO2 which which are the key molecules

1567
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,760
that are interesting in this

1568
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:09,520
application it's the balance

1569
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:12,280
in how the energy is distributed between

1570
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:15,400
the translational rotational and

1571
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:19,080
vibrational levels of the CO2

1572
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:24,639
molecule what happens here is that as uh

1573
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:27,920
the um rapid expansion occurs

1574
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:31,920
also here we have Sonic and Mac 4 at the

1575
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:36,600
exit so it's similar to the other

1576
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:40,920
problem what happens is that here you

1577
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:43,480
have a lot of random kinetic

1578
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,159
energy of the thermal agitation of

1579
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:50,080
molecules and the nozzle takes that

1580
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:54,239
kinetic energy and transforms it into um

1581
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:58,840
stream the kinetic energy of the flow

1582
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:58,840
like a a bulk

1583
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:07,239
velocity and if the uh Collision

1584
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:11,400
mechanisms were very

1585
01:28:07,239 --> 01:28:14,719
effective uh as soon as the the

1586
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,800
translational degree of Freedom uh uh

1587
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,280
cool

1588
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:21,800
down because of the expansion you see

1589
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:23,719
the temperature goes from high to low so

1590
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:27,159
that means the the thermal kinetic

1591
01:28:23,719 --> 01:28:29,560
energy cools down it transforms into um

1592
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:32,760
flow kinetic energy you you can see that

1593
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,320
here this is the flow kinetic energy

1594
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:37,280
goes up and this is the thermal kinetic

1595
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:40,840
energy that goes

1596
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:43,360
down and this is the uh vibrational

1597
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,719
energy the energy in the vibrational

1598
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:48,520
modes of the

1599
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:51,400
molecules those also if the effective if

1600
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:55,400
if the effectiveness was very high

1601
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:57,840
would would lose energy quickly and uh

1602
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:02,520
and trans and transfer the the the

1603
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:05,119
vibrational energy into the uh kinetic

1604
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:10,400
and rotation

1605
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:13,119
and but this mechanism is relatively

1606
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,960
slow

1607
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:16,960
so the degree of this

1608
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:24,560
equilibrium builds up in the

1609
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,560
vibrational levels

1610
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,159
for example this is the lower level it

1611
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:33,239
gets cool

1612
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:37,840
down but there is a an upper

1613
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:43,400
level upper vibrational level that

1614
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:43,400
remains sort of Frozen for a long time

1615
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:50,280
Downstream so why is that important for

1616
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:52,560
this

1617
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,920
application for this application what

1618
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,760
count counts is is the vibrational

1619
01:29:54,920 --> 01:30:00,159
levels of the CO2

1620
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:04,239
molecule and the CO2 molecules

1621
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:07,600
can being a molecule aligned this way

1622
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:07,600
can vibrate in various

1623
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:15,520
ways

1624
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:19,199
uh this is a symmetric U

1625
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:25,280
stretching this is a bending

1626
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:29,239
mode and this is a asymmetric so it goes

1627
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:31,400
distance from one side and while it goes

1628
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:32,880
shorter on the other side and and keeps

1629
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:35,840
going like

1630
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:40,639
that now these each of these modes have

1631
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:43,560
frequencies and these frequencies are

1632
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:47,760
quantized because we live uh in a

1633
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:50,000
Quantum world and that's

1634
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:54,520
uh uh these

1635
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:58,000
are like harmonic oscillators Springs a

1636
01:30:54,520 --> 01:31:00,960
mass and a spring according to Quantum

1637
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,719
Mechanics cannot live in a continuous

1638
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,719
set of levels but the levels are

1639
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,960
quantized and so the molecule if you

1640
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:15,520
give more energy to the

1641
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:18,280
molecule you need to give it enough to

1642
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:23,159
jump to the to up to another

1643
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:23,159
level you cannot give it continuously

1644
01:31:25,239 --> 01:31:31,880
and the same is if you have excited some

1645
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:34,679
high level in order for that to uh

1646
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:37,119
release energy it has to jump down to

1647
01:31:34,679 --> 01:31:37,119
another

1648
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:48,159
level uh the important one is this level

1649
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:50,119
here which is at this

1650
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:53,199
uh

1651
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:54,719
wavelength wavelength is a frequency you

1652
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:56,960
know there is a relation between

1653
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,600
frequency and wavelength so the

1654
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:02,119
frequency of

1655
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:05,159
vibration uh is related to the

1656
01:32:02,119 --> 01:32:07,800
wavelength of

1657
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:09,280
and here it is important to look at the

1658
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:12,840
wavelength

1659
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:15,719
because because of photons because of

1660
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:19,679
light we will see in a

1661
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:22,880
moment so the important uh thing that

1662
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:25,760
happens here is that this vibrational

1663
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,080
level which is a high level would we say

1664
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:32,560
up somewhere

1665
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:34,840
here is uh relatively highly populated

1666
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:39,040
in the hot gases before the they enter

1667
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,040
the nozzle because we are at high

1668
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:45,040
temperature uh not only

1669
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,560
uh that

1670
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:50,239
level

1671
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:53,280
is uh very close I mean the the that

1672
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:55,760
level for CO2 is very close to a similar

1673
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:58,400
level for nitrogen

1674
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:01,840
molecules so by simple Collision the

1675
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:03,920
nitrogen molecules can populate the CO2

1676
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,600
that CO2 particular level because they

1677
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:10,000
are tuned so to speak they are exactly

1678
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:12,119
the same height so it's there is a good

1679
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,560
chance that you

1680
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:17,800
transfer the energy of one to uh to the

1681
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:21,280
other

1682
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:24,800
one and that's why uh they chose

1683
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:27,080
nitrogen and CO2

1684
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:30,159
and this one when it

1685
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:33,639
decays it decays to this

1686
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:37,639
level now every time a vibrational level

1687
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:40,000
decays to a lower level it emits a

1688
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:42,159
photon if that

1689
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,960
happens

1690
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:46,960
in uh

1691
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:50,360
just random

1692
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:55,719
situation those photons would go would

1693
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:55,719
go in U uh in all directions randomly

1694
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:01,280
that is

1695
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:08,080
called spontaneous

1696
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:10,239
emission but if that uh Decay happens uh

1697
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,520
in a in a situation in which there are

1698
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:15,000
other photons with the same frequency so

1699
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,520
other photons that have are exact

1700
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,320
exactly the same

1701
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:25,719
frequency uh these other photons

1702
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:25,719
stimulate the emission of these uh uh

1703
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:32,920
Decay by producing photons that have

1704
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:36,719
exactly the same uh frequency and

1705
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:39,840
direction this is what uh happens this

1706
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,840
is called stimulated

1707
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:47,320
emission and this

1708
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:51,440
is the object of uh uh the objective of

1709
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:55,560
of of this entire construction because

1710
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:59,199
by doing that let's see if I havea oops

1711
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:01,199
by doing that this picture shows you uh

1712
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:04,960
the details of how big this is thing

1713
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:07,119
this thing is so the nozzle is about um

1714
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:10,560
a

1715
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:15,040
meter a meter here

1716
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:17,360
um so what they do essentially is to put

1717
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:20,159
um I'm sorry this is the diffuser the

1718
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,080
nozzle uh the good part the the nozzle

1719
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:24,199
is

1720
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:26,760
here these are the nozzles so several of

1721
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:29,679
them this is the expansion and this is

1722
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:32,080
the downstream area in which we have the

1723
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:35,760
uh that degree of dise equilibrium so in

1724
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:39,159
which I have populated still populated

1725
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:41,560
the high levels this is called inversion

1726
01:35:39,159 --> 01:35:43,639
of population it's the it's the inverse

1727
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:48,280
of what you would be at equilibrium at

1728
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:51,920
the local values of of temperature

1729
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:54,800
but uh with that

1730
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,239
inversion uh it turn turns out if you

1731
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,560
have an inversion of population means

1732
01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:02,199
that this one is more populated and

1733
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:04,119
therefore the rate at which um you

1734
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:07,880
produce photons by

1735
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:09,480
Decay is higher than the typical rate at

1736
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,800
which photons get

1737
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:17,600
absorbed uh uh in order to repopulate

1738
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:21,280
that one so you have a net release of

1739
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:23,800
photons and if you put that between

1740
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,639
mirrors

1741
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,239
so that these photons go back and forth

1742
01:36:25,639 --> 01:36:31,560
and stimulate the emission then you get

1743
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:33,360
the building up of light coherent light

1744
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,840
photons with the same frequency same

1745
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:38,920
direction so that's a

1746
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:42,040
laser and this is actually a power laser

1747
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:44,960
because usually the lasers that you have

1748
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:49,119
you use for like pointer laser for

1749
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:52,719
PowerPoint is uh I don't know micro

1750
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:54,400
microwatts or mwatts I don't know very

1751
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:57,199
small power

1752
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:58,760
but with this one and we're talking

1753
01:36:57,199 --> 01:37:02,000
about

1754
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:06,360
1970s the output was continuous output

1755
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:09,679
of light of 60 kilowatt which is a huge

1756
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:12,159
amount of of power especially if it is

1757
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:16,119
that's the kind of light with which you

1758
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:21,199
can do laser cutting of

1759
01:37:16,119 --> 01:37:23,360
metals okay so and this is all due to

1760
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:25,040
the fact that you managed to establish

1761
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:29,280
the degree of dise

1762
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:32,719
equilibrium and I think I would stop

1763
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,719
here for today
