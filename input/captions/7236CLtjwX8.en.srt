00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,720
We've known for the last 400 years about

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
our nine, well, eight planets in our

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,960
solar system. So, how are we now just

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,639
finding all of these other planets?

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
Here's an easy way to think about it.

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,880
This light is a star, and I am a

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,640
transiting exoplanet. When I pass in

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,320
front of the star, you can't see my

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,920
features, but you can see my outline,

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,920
and that's how you know I'm there. And

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
that's exactly how the transiting method

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,840
works. What scientists do is that they

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,840
monitor the brightness of a star over

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
time. And what they look for are these

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,599
tiny dips in the overall light. And that

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
tells you that there may be a planet

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
around that star. The transit method

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,200
needs planets that orbit their star

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
quickly so that we can get lots of

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,680
transit and get a good signal. It's

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,840
amazing that such a simple method can

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,760
help us find so many new planets. Just

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,200
by looking for dips in brightness, we

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,520
might be able to find a plant that can

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,480
host life. All we had to know was

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,960
exactly how and where to look. For more
