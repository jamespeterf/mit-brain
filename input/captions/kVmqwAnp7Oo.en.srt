1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,170

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,180
Good afternoon, all.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,860
Thank you for attending this
exciting session on translation.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,430
This session is all about how
we get our discoveries out

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,090
of the lab and to the clinic,
into the hands of patients

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,990
and doctors and into companies.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,590
My name is Ellen Roach.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm an associate professor
in mechanical engineering

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,020
and the Institute for Medical
Engineering and Science.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,800
And I have the privilege of
chairing today's session.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
We are so lucky to have four
distinguished speakers today

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,300
who will speak to us about
different aspects of translating

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,730
their science and technologies.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,960
I could listen to these
speakers for hours,

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,820
but we have a short
amount of time,

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,320
so I'll introduce
everyone at a high level

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,650
now and keep the talks
moving afterwards.

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,010
So first, we have
Professor Andrew Lo.

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,580
Professor Lo is the Charles
and Susan T Harris Professor

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,580
of finance at Sloan and the
director of the Laboratory

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,599
for Financial Engineering.

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,320
Professor Lo will speak with
us about financing translation,

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,800
describing the inflection
point of biomedicine

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,630
and proposing new business
models to translate technology.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,120
Next, we'll hear
about translation

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,570
through multiple startups
in the area of nanomedicine.

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,210
Professor Sangeeta Bhatia is
the John and Dorothy Wilson

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,660
Professor of Health
Sciences and Technology

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,020
and electrical engineering
and computer science.

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,140
She is a Howard Hughes
Medical institute investigator

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,380
and directs the marble center
for cancer and nanomedicine.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,150
Professor Bhatia
will speak to us

33
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,510
about translating nanomedicine
technologies for cancer

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,350
detection and describe her
prolific co-founder timeline

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,960
in translating technology
out of her lab.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,960
She will then describe how
she supports other faculty

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,260
in translating their technology
and the incredible impact

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,630
and success of the
Faculty Founder Initiative

39
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,990
she has created.

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,430
Professor Hugh Herr
will speak next.

41
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,840
Professor Herr is a professor
of media arts and sciences

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,890
at MIT Media Lab and the
co-director of the K. Lisa Yang

43
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,490
Center for Bionics.

44
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,090
Professor Herr's work
melds human physiology

45
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,310
and electromechanics
to produce systems

46
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,150
that emulate human biomechanics,
improving mobility for those

47
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,220
with paralysis and limb loss.

48
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,920
He will speak about how he
has translated technology

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,410
from the Biomechatronic
Mechatronics Lab

50
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,960
to enhance human
physical capability

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,890
through for-profit and
non-profit mechanisms.

52
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,530
Finally, Professor Alex
Shalek will speak to us

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,350
about engineering our biomedical
ecosystem for global impact.

54
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,910
Professor Shalek is the
J.W. Kiekhaefer Professor

55
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,220
in the Institute for Medical
Engineering and Science

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,170
and the Department of Chemistry.

57
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,650
He is also a member of the Broad
Institute, the Koch Institute,

58
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,900
and the Ragon Institute,
and the director

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,300
of the Institute for Medical
Engineering and Science.

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,530
Alex will describe how his
group develop and apply tools

61
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,690
to understand balance
in tissue ecosystems.

62
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,050
He'll describe the
opportunities at MIT

63
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,320
for translation, how we can
engineer the right solutions

64
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,010
to key problems, leveraging
global partners to scale

65
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,990
and addressing
systemic challenges.

66
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,030
He will conclude the
session describing

67
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,150
how this is achieved through
broad collaboration, which

68
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,780
will create a natural segue
into the next session.

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,720
I do hope you enjoy these talks
and you are inspired by them.

70
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,590
I thank the speakers in
advance for sharing examples

71
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,680
of their work and for imparting
their wisdom and philosophies

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,400
on biomedical translation.

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,550
Thank you.

74
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,980
[APPLAUSE]

75
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:57,260

76
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,480
So I'd like to start
by thanking Ellen

77
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,240
for that generous
introduction and for chairing

78
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,720
the session and
President Kornbluth

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,250
for putting together this event.

80
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,100
Thank you all for
being here as well.

81
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm a financial economist
by training and trade.

82
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,630
And you might be wondering,
who ordered that?

83
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,260
What am I doing here in an event
of otherwise serious scientists,

84
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,520
clinicians, and
biopharma leaders?

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,900
Well, no matter what
field you're in,

86
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,200
no matter what you're
doing, no matter

87
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,270
what your goals are, at
some point or another,

88
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,730
if you're looking to
affect patient lives,

89
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,840
you will need money,
and that means

90
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,260
you'll be speaking my language.

91
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,000
[LAUGHTER]

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,950
So what I'm going
to be talking about

93
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,590
is how we engage
in the financing

94
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,340
of translational medicine.

95
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,827
And to begin, clearly we are at
a biomedical inflection point.

96
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:51,660
And I'll give you two
illustrations of that.

97
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,770
The first comes from
my world of finance.

98
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,480
This is a chart of the 30
best-selling drugs in the year

99
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,750
2000.

100
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm sure you can't see
the specific drugs.

101
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,800
But highlighted in
blue are those drugs

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,790
that came out of
academia or biotech

103
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,080
four 26 out of the top 30
came out of big pharma.

104
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,520
And in the good old days,
that's how translation occurred,

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,500
really through big
pharma efforts.

106
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,870
Fast forward 18 years
to 2018, and now here

107
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,900
are the 30 best-selling
drugs in that year.

108
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,390
Highlighted in blue
are those that came out

109
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,400
of biotech and academia--

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,250
24 of the top 30, nine
out of the top 10.

111
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,270
Medicine has changed.

112
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,570
The second way.

113
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,280
We know that
biomedical advances are

114
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,880
at an inflection point is
because my MIT colleagues told

115
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,400
me so.

116
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,900
[LAUGHTER]

117
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,260
In particular, Susan Hockfield,
Tyler Jackson, Phil Sharp

118
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,350
in 2016 published a report
titled Convergence--

119
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,050
The Convergence of the Life
Sciences, Physical Sciences,

120
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,780
and Engineering.

121
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,860
All of the different
fields are coming together

122
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,880
to produce remarkable
advances for medicine.

123
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,490
And the insiders
in this industry

124
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,510
call it the omics revolution.

125
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,730
Every one of these omics has
experienced tremendous advances

126
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,300
over the last even five
years, never mind 10 or 20,

127
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,250
with the exception of one.

128
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,820
There's been one omics that's
been a bottleneck to progress,

129
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,870
and that is economics--

130
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,870
[LAUGHTER]

131
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,150
--because we got to
pay for this stuff.

132
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,370
And the business
models that we're using

133
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,800
are still tied to the
past and haven't really

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,560
taken into account all of the
innovation that's going on.

135
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,720
So I want to talk to you
about that omics economics

136
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,500
and, in particular, describe
how translation occurs

137
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,130
at a high level at a
caricature from my perspective

138
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,630
as an economist.

139
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,790
So what is the life cycle
of biomedical innovation?

140
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,470
Well, it begins here
in the laboratory

141
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,830
with a researcher and an idea.

142
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,140
And that idea sparks,
usually, a collaboration

143
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,800
of additional experts that come
together to take that idea,

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,860
round it out, put it into
various different tests,

145
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,210
experiments we call them.

146
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,750
And ultimately, when
all is said and done,

147
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,187
and you collect the data,
and you've got the results,

148
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:24,770
and it looks like
you've got something

149
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,010
that might one day help a
patient, what do you do?

150
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,665
You publish a paper, right?

151
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:31,165
[BUZZER]

152
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,830
Well, wrong.

153
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,670
[LAUGHTER]

154
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,740
Do not do that.

155
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,000
What you are supposed to do--
and it's remarkable how many

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,860
life scientists
aren't aware of this--

157
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,130
you file a patent disclosure,
after which you are totally

158
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,000
free to publish our paper.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,150
And this is important because,
while many people think

160
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,120
that filing a patent is
somehow dirty and too

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,890
commercial and
pecuniary, and you're

162
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,860
getting involved in the world
of money, what you're doing

163
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,980
is reserving the right for
somebody else, typically

164
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,720
an investor, to basically
benefit, get a rate of return

165
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,940
for deploying capital
to take that idea

166
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,520
and translate it into medicine.

167
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,160
So after you publish a paper,
do some more experiments.

168
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,940
You're able to now
demonstrate, perhaps

169
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,960
in animals, that maybe this
actually might turn into a drug.

170
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,920
And so at that point, you're
able to get your patent,

171
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,350
be able to create a
company, perhaps rent

172
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,919
some space at Lab Central,
and then ultimately start

173
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,950
going through the very
long and important process

174
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,520
of clinical testing, at
the end of which you might,

175
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,329

178
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,450
But more often than not--

[EXPLOSION SOUND EFFECT]

180

--you will fail.

181
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,270
And that, in a nutshell, is
what translation is all about.

182
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,540
What makes this process
very challenging

183
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,880
is that you need money
every step of the way.

184
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,060
And if that money is
interrupted for any reason,

185
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,540
then the whole thing
pretty much ends.

186
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,740
Biomedical innovation is
binary, and that kind of risk

187
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,530
is something that most
investors are simply not

188
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,670
able to withstand, so we
need better ways of financing

189
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,290
translational medicine.

190
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,060
And that's what I would like
to talk to you about today.

191
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,370
Here's an idea-- instead of
developing drugs one at a time,

192
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,000
why not pool these
various different drugs

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,200
into a portfolio, maybe
even across universities?

194
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,320
Imagine, for example,
a business model

195
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,240
that looks like this, where
on the left hand side,

196
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,350
you've got multiple
universities pooling

197
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,220
their intellectual property to
create a vehicle that investors

198
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,490
can participate in.

199
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,700
Why multiple universities?

200
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,840
Well, because MIT
can't do everything,

201
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,372
and so we have to leave
room for some other folks.

202
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:59,080
The bottom line is that we don't
know where the next breakthrough

203
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,940
is going to come from because
of the complexity of the life

204
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,732
sciences, and so we
want to be able to have

205
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:06,350
multiple shots on goal even
beyond a single university.

206
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,840
But if we can construct
that portfolio,

207
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,150
manage it, create programs
around the most promising ideas,

208
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,870
not necessarily requiring
faculty to give up tenure

209
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,760
and become CEOs when they
really don't want to do that,

210
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,670
and they want to
do their research

211
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,570
and let other folks who are
ideally suited to manage

212
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,700
the businesses
grow that business,

213
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,690
that's really what
we're talking about.

214
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,910
With this kind of
business model,

215
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,010
all of the various
different stakeholders

216
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,960
will get what they
want, and they

217
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,810
will be able to
contribute what they can.

218
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,680
What do we call
this business model?

219
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,430
Well, I call it
tech transferase.

220
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,610
[LAUGHTER]

221
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,660
And for those of you
who are laughing,

222
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,630
you are critical for the
success of this business model.

223
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,966
Thank you.

224
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:56,438
[APPLAUSE]

225
00:10:56,438 --> 00:11:08,850

226
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,290
Hi, I'm Sangeeta.

227
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,180
I'm trained as a
physician and an engineer.

228
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,130
And I'm going to
tell you a story--

229
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,580
a case study, really,
that came out of my lab

230
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,800
in the field of
nanomedicine-- and use it

231
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,950
to illustrate how you can
translate through startups,

232
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,520
in the way Andrew described, and
how it helps to advance things

233
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,300
to patients, but also how it
can drive the next generation

234
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,760
of innovation here at MIT.

235
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,410
And then I'll close
with some ideas

236
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,990
about how we hope to
enable more faculty to do

237
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,550
in this next chapter
that MIT is embarking on.

238
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,590
So to begin, I want to tell
you what nanomedicine is.

239
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,130
It's nanotechnology
applied to medicine.

240
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,130
And nanotechnology
itself is a field

241
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,340
of materials that are
smaller than 100 manometers.

242
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,280
Human hair is 100 microns, so
this is 1,000 times smaller.

243
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,380
Now, this is a field
with two origin stories.

244
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,420
On the left, you see microchips,
semiconductor fabrication.

245
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,520
These drive all of
your smartphones.

246
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,730
And you may know the
new NVIDIA chip has

247
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,590
feature sizes of 4 manometers.

248
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,260
So using what we call
top down fabrication,

249
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,260
we can make very
teeny, tiny things.

250
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,480
The other origin story comes
from the world of chemistry.

251
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,910
On the right, what you
see are quantum dots.

252
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,210
These are when you
assemble nanomaterials

253
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,470
by collecting atoms and
creating emergent properties.

254
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,470
And this is an example of
quantum dots, something

255
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,320
that Moungi Bawendi shared
the Nobel Prize for chemistry

256
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,940
last year here at MIT.

257
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,750
And these materials
are really cool.

258
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,540
They're exactly the
same composition,

259
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,400
but they glow different colors
simply based on their size.

260
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,160
So there's a whole world of
material science and physics

261
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,340
happening at the nanoscale
where properties-- electronic,

262
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,460
magnetic, optical-- emerge
when you make them small.

263
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,620
And what's really
exciting in this moment

264
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,170
is that if you think about
what that does for medicine,

265
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,950
it turns out there's also
biological properties

266
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,570
at this length scale.

267
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,070
And if you think
hard about it, it's

268
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,960
not surprising that
this is the case,

269
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,080
because if you look at this
molecular ruler, actually,

270
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,680
the nanoscale is the scale at
which biology communicates.

271
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,860
DNA is 2 manometers in width.

272
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,020
A receptor is 10
manometers in size.

273
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,230
A virus is 100 manometers.

274
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,990
So that is the scale that
all of the interesting things

275
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,220
are happening.

276
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,420
And in fact, the field has
made many, many nanomaterials

277
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,390
that have been in clinical
trials and in humans.

278
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,110
In fact, many of you got
one of these nanomaterials.

279
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,030
The lipid nanoparticle
on the top

280
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,570
there was the encapsulation
for the mRNA vaccine,

281
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,360
both of the mRNA
vaccines for COVID.

282
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,810
So these materials have now
been in millions of people

283
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,500
and been proven to be safe.

284
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,020
And as a community, over about
20 years now around the world,

285
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,380
people have been
working in nanomedicine

286
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,907
and discovering what is the
biology of the nanoscale.

287
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,240
And I'm not going to go through
everything on the right,

288
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,750
but just to say that we're
finding out all kinds of things

289
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,410
about the size and shape of
a material, dictating how it

290
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,660
interacts with the human body.

291
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,520
So in my lab, what
we've been doing

292
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,390
is trying to think about what
could this do for cancer.

293
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,000
Now, cancer is a
disease that you

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,070
know could be
really best treated

295
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,050
if we could find it early.

296
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,160
And some cancers, unfortunately,
can grow for eight to 10 years

297
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,250
before being detected even by
the best screening technologies

298
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,260
that we have today.

299
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,010
So we had the idea, what if
we can make a machine that

300
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,680
can travel through the
bloodstream, look for cancer,

301
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,220
and when it finds it, report
it to the outside world?

302
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,920
This is how the machine works.

303
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,440
So here you see
100-nanometer particle.

304
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,400
It's circulating
in the bloodstream.

305
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,120
And it's going to leak out into
the surrounding tissue, which

306
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,110
is a tumor.

307
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,910
Once it's inside the tumor,
it's designed to detect enzymes

308
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,420
that tumors make.

309
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,070
Those of you who are
biologists, these are proteases.

310
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,480
They're depicted here in yellow.

311
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,410
And these enzymes can
activate these materials.

312
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,430
Because it's a
catalytic reaction,

313
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,660
each enzyme can release
1,000 reporters.

314
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,750
So this is an amplification.

315
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,740
And those reporters are now even
tinier than the first material.

316
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,430
These are about 3
manometers in size.

317
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,780
So when they get back
in the bloodstream,

318
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,700
now they are small enough to
be filtered and concentrated

319
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,510
twenty-fold by the
kidney into the urine.

320
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,640
So this starts out as a shot.

321
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,180
And an hour later, you collect
something in the urine that is

322
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,520
20,000-fold amplified for
every copy of an enzyme.

323
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,270
So we've been working
on this in the lab.

324
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,910
The first paper was
published in 2013.

325
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,450
We started a company
called Glympse Bio, like,

326
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,910
get a glimpse inside the body.

327
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,670
And we did exactly what
Andrew directed us to do.

328
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,730
We first filed a patent,
then raised the capital.

329
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,320
I co-founded it with
my postdoc, Gabe Kwong,

330
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,160
who is now a full
professor at Georgia Tech.

331
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,600
And that company did things at
a scale with dedicated teams

332
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
that we couldn't do here at MIT.

333
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,390
We did scale-up manufacturing.

334
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,620
We went to the FDA.

335
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,170
[INAUDIBLE] two
species toxicology.

336
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,730
We did human clinical trials.

337
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,630
And now they're on their
way in liver cancer,

338
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,190
trying to show that
this could work

339
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,860
to find liver tumors
in patients that

340
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,500
have advanced fibrotic disease.

341
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,890
So that's been very exciting.

342
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,710
That's been happening
outside of campus since 2015.

343
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,540
But what's exciting about this
is that the students in the lab

344
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,900
now are unlocked.

345
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,460
They can see that
this can happen.

346
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,790
There's a path to patience,
and they get more innovative.

347
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,740
And so what did they
start thinking about?

348
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,320
Well, what if you could make
a urine test like a pregnancy

349
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,820
test?

350
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,870
What if it could be on paper,
and you could read out a cancer

351
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,540
test at the point of care?

352
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,319
So we invented that.

353
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,569
What if you were
interested in lung cancer?

354
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,670
You could breathe out like a
breathalyzer in 10 minutes.

355
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,190
So we invented that.

356
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,710
What if you could find
out where the tumor was

357
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,040
and if it had spread?

358
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,339
So we invented a
version like that.

359
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,109
And what if you could use AI to
design these materials with--

360
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,030
by design instead of creating
libraries like we used to?

361
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,110
And so we're about to publish
a paper with Microsoft on that.

362
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,890
So there's all kinds of
things that the translation

363
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,410
into the company then
fed back into MIT.

364
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,110
Finally, we have physicians in
the labs, not just engineers.

365
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,410
And they decided that this would
be good, not just for cancer,

366
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,680
but for something that may
be surprise all of you--

367
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,800
pediatric pneumonia.

368
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,260
When you have a child in
the ER that has pneumonia,

369
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,010
the best thing to know is do
they need antibiotics or not?

370
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,410
Is it bacterial or is it viral?

371
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,020
So we're working
on a breath test

372
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,990
to be able to detect that in 10
minutes with foundation support.

373
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,560
And this whole
field now has a lot

374
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,690
of investment coming
in from places

375
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,060
like ARPA-H. So
the innovation is

376
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,100
keeping going by
virtue of having

377
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,850
done the start up company.

378
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,860
So Glympse here I
started in 2015.

379
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,520
I want to just say that
MIT is an incredible place

380
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,880
to start companies.

381
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,790
And as an academic entrepreneur,
you learn as you go.

382
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,680
This is a muscle.

383
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,200
You can see that my
entrepreneurial journey

384
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,490
accelerated over time.

385
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,630
And I feel very lucky to be
here, not just geographically,

386
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,330
but with colleagues like
Bob Langer and Phil Sharp,

387
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,780
who gave their time and
their wisdom and advice

388
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,560
about how to stay a professor
and be an entrepreneur.

389
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,870
Now, I will say that in
this next chapter of MIT,

390
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,120
I hope we can do even more.

391
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,340
And that's because,
as I did this,

392
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,400
I found that very
few of my women

393
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
colleagues had a
foot in both worlds.

394
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,340
And in fact, MIT is
an incredible place

395
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,230
to make that observation
because we really

396
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,890
have a playbook for how to
handle gender disparities, which

397
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,220
are documented in this amazing
book if you haven't read it,

398
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,870
the playbook is--

399
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,770
make a team of people
to address the problem,

400
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,540
gather the data, which we did,
find institutional champions

401
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,810
like Anantha Chandrakasan and
Maria Zuber and now Sally,

402
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,690
and talk about what addressing
this gap would address.

403
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,710
So we've been doing that.

404
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,400
Finally, do experiments.

405
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,900
So we have the Faculty
Founder Initiative started.

406
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,870
It's just celebrated
its three-year birthday.

407
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,550
And I'm happy to tell any of you
who want to learn more about it

408
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,110
how we've been helping these
21 amazing faculty unlock

409
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,320
their own inventions.

410
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,630
19 of them are now
building startups,

411
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,310
and we hope that all of them
become serial entrepreneurs

412
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,590
in this next chapter.

413
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,210
Thank you.

414
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,696
[APPLAUSE]

415
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:10,170

416
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,380
Good afternoon.

417
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,230
My name is Hugh Herr, and here
you see my beautiful legs.

418
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,090
From the knee down, I'm a
bunch of nuts and bolts--

419
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,130
three computers the size of your
thumbnail, six sensors, a muscle

420
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,050
tendon-like actuator.

421
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,110
These devices
propel me as I walk,

422
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,490
and I'm actually able to
walk in a normal fashion.

423
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,490
Years ago, I founded a
company called Bionics Medical

424
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:48,270
Technologies that translated
the prosthesis outside of MIT.

425
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,150
Today, they've been fit
to tens of thousands

426
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:56,610
of people, many wounded
US soldiers as well.

427
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,800
So at the New K. Lisa Yang
Center for Bionics here at MIT,

428
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,130
we're taking the next
step, pun intended.

429
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,200
The legs that I'm wearing
are intrinsically controlled.

430
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,060
They're not connected
to my brain.

431
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,920
So there's algorithms
running on chip.

432
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,830
So what we want
to do is actually

433
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,920
link the next
generation of prostheses

434
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,670
to the brain, to the spinal
cord, and central brain

435
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,500
via muscles and tendons.

436
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,560
So we're actually
not only manipulating

437
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,810
bone and soft tissues
and surgical designs,

438
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,740
but we're actually putting
hardware inside the body.

439
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,580
This is an
osseointegrated prosthesis

440
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,060
where there's a titanium shaft
going through the skin membrane

441
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,640
into the residual limb bone.

442
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,200
It's a mechanical
anchoring point.

443
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,330
And as you can see, you
see an electrical connector

444
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,520
where we can pass 16 fine
wire leads from computers

445
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,230
on the external limb
to, for example,

446
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,960
electrodes inside the body
and bidirectionally singles.

447
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,210
So this is not a
wireless approach.

448
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,600
It's a wired approach.

449
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,570
We recently got a paper
published in Nature Medicine

450
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,290
a few months ago.

451
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,800
This is the first
bionic limb that's

452
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,950
completely controlled
by the brain that

453
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,350
restores natural movement gait.

454
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,810
So all these movements that you
see, all the nuance of movements

455
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,330
that occur biomechanically
when a person goes up and down,

456
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:33,370
steps are being mediated
through the electromechanics.

457
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,030
So we were also
applying our techniques

458
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,120
to the upper extremity.

459
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,780
Sorry, let me go back.

460
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,015
Tricky.

461
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:44,370
Well, let me try once more.

462
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:50,360

463
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,420
Doesn't quite work.

464
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,550
There we go.

465
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,200
This is a blocks and
blocks demonstration.

466
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,880
The task is how many
blocks can this person

467
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,590
put in the box in 60 seconds?

468
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,700
So we currently have the record
with our neural interfacing

469
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,920
technologies.

470
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,770
We're not only doing
brain controlled limbs,

471
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:17,120
but we're also closing the loop
where we reflect proprioception,

472
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,230
the sense of position, movement,
and load, and cutaneous signals,

473
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,160
the sense touch,
from the prosthesis

474
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,530
back into the nervous system.

475
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,320
This is a first
human subject that

476
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,640
received a cutaneous
interface design put forth

477
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,030
by my group called the
cutaneous mechano interface.

478
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,490
Basically, surgically, we took--

479
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,640
when her limb was
amputated, we took skin

480
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,430
from the bottom of
the foot, and we

481
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,530
put that skin inside
her amputated residuum,

482
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,150
wrapped a muscle around it.

483
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,050
And then we're actuating
that muscle via computer,

484
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,440
via the 16 fine wire leads.

485
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,590
This video is shot
immediately after we

486
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,783
stimulated the constructs,
and this is her response.

487
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:05,450
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

488
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,670
- So fascinating.

489
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,770
[MAN CHUCKLES]

490
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,780
This is just so
different from everything

491
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,090
else I've been feeling
the last day and a half.

492
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,400
- OK, so this is definitely
not residual limb--

493
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,092
- No.

494
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:20,580
- --or muscle stimulation?

495
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,550
This is pure phantom
limb sensation.

496
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,050
- Yeah.

497
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,625
I'm not feeling anything
in my limb at all.

498
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,370
[END PLAYBACK]

499
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,090
That was wonderful.

500
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,380
Obviously, the constructs are
physically in her residuum.

501
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,310
She didn't feel anything there.

502
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,340
She actually felt the bottom of
her foot that's no longer there.

503
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,250
So obviously, we're going to
put one of these devices on her,

504
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:47,480
put pressure sensing that
senses pressures as she walks

505
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,890
and then reflect that
into her nervous system

506
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,210
so she can feel the ground.

507
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,200
So that's the neural interfacing
part, the prosthetic part.

508
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,830
There's a startup company
called Muscle Metrics that's

509
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,810
being launched outside of MIT.

510
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,570
This is a technology--
so that's an exoskeleton.

511
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,140
It's a bionic shoe,
kind of like an e-bike

512
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,690
for legs, that augments
walking, running, and jumping.

513
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,110
This is a company I
co-founded, called

514
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,400
Defy, that's not only
focused on rehabilitation,

515
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,630
but human augmentation,
extending capability

516
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,610
beyond nature.

517
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,700
So we're using
this platform today

518
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,380
to also address medical needs.

519
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,210
So using small magnetic
spheres into weak muscle.

520
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,790
In the calf, for
example, after a stroke

521
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,440
and using magnetic
arrays on the skin,

522
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,470
we can track weak
muscle dynamics

523
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,400
and then reflect those to
control a motorized exoskeleton

524
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,050
to augment strength.

525
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:54,240
So I think we'd be very remiss
if the only thing we did here

526
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,930
at MIT is expand the
boundaries of technology.

527
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,840
Sadly, there's so many
areas of the world

528
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,760
that do not have access to
prosthetics and orthotics.

529
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,780
Arguably, the area of the
world with the greatest need

530
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,680
is in western Africa
and Sierra Leone.

531
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,920
As many of you know,
there's a civil war there

532
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,690
that ended in 2002, where
rebel forces hacked off

533
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,260
limbs with machetes.

534
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,250
Now there's tens of thousands
of people with limb loss.

535
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,270
So as part of the K. Lisa Yangs
Center for Bionics here at MIT,

536
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,720
we're actually building a
prosthetic and orthotic sector

537
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,800
in this war-torn nation.

538
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,920
What is our goal?

539
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,210
Sustainable care and delivery
of orthotics and prosthetics

540
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,110
services in Sierra Leone.

541
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,920
We want to increase annual
production of prosthesis

542
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,830
by an order of magnitude.

543
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,310
Our approach that
we call SCITT--

544
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,040
an acronym that stands for
Supply Chain Infrastructure,

545
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,580
Technology, and
Education-- we feel only

546
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,860
by having results
in all four pillars

547
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,710
can we introduce
sustainable change.

548
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,900
We're three years
into our program,

549
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,700
and we're experiencing
tremendous success.

550
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,480
We have many glorious stories.

551
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,890
I'll end with one such story.

552
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,880
This is Mohamed [INAUDIBLE].

553
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,220
Like tens of thousands of
other citizens of Sierra Leone,

554
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,590
he lost his limb
in the civil war.

555
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,890
As a young man, the rebel forces
were attacking his village,

556
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,120
and he ran, and he stepped on
a land mine and lost his limb.

557
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,860
We just fit a prosthesis to him.

558
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,370
Now he can walk freely
for the first time

559
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,300
without crutches or canes.

560
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,840
He's passionate about
soccer, and he can freely

561
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,810
be seen on the soccer field
enjoying his favorite game.

562
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:58,730
So just to finish up, restoring
quality of life and independence

563
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,610
of living for people with
physical disability is,

564
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,120
I believe, a moral imperative.

565
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,180
Disability experienced by
a friend or family member

566
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,160
is so common that
we just view it

567
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,140
as part of the human
condition, but it

568
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,000
doesn't have to be that way.

569
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,540
A great narrative in this 21st
century will be the emergence

570
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,810
of humans with technology,
resulting in the mitigation

571
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:25,020
of disability and unleashing
humanity's greatest potential.

572
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,960
Thank you so much.

573
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,262
[APPLAUSE]

574
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:38,710

575
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,500
Hi, everyone.

576
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,135
I'm Alex.

577
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,260
Thank you very much for
the opportunity to present,

578
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,060
and I definitely don't have any
videos that are quite that cool.

579
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,740
What I was hoping
to talk about today

580
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,640
was what I really think today's
event is all about, which

581
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,520
is the opportunity to come
together to really engineer

582
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,568
our entire ecosystem to have
global impact, as was very

583
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,860
beautifully illustrated by
the talks that just occurred

584
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,060
from Sangeeta and Hugh but
also from many of the ones that

585
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,600
came earlier this morning.

586
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,970
So before I begin, I
thought I would just

587
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,220
tell you a little bit about
what we do within our lab.

588
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,430
And fundamentally, what
our lab is interested

589
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,390
in is this idea of
homeostasis and tissues.

590
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,710
Now at MIT, I
teach 560, which is

591
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,010
thermodynamics for those of you
that haven't had to take it.

592
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,803
And as a chemistry
professor, if you gave me

593
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,720
a pressure and a
temperature, I could tell you

594
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,250
what equilibrium is
for any given reaction.

595
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,980
But if you ask me what
balance is in a tissue,

596
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,510
I wouldn't be able to tell you.

597
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,390
I can't tell you what that
means molecularly or cellularly.

598
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,330
But I know it's
important because if I

599
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,013
get too much of an
immune response,

600
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,430
I can get tissue
damage and death.

601
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,680
Like, I might see in an
autoimmune condition.

602
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,780
Or if I have too
little, I can become

603
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,030
susceptible to
opportunistic infections

604
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,780
or the outgrowth of tumors.

605
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,900
So a lot of what we try
and do within the lab

606
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,880
is to understand,
through studying

607
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,170
different human contexts, what
is it that defines health?

608
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,970
What are the deviations
that are induced by exposure

609
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,430
to environmental perturbations
like pathogens or pollutants?

610
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,902
And how could we rebalance
the system therapeutically

611
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,860
or prophylactically buffer
it through something

612
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,960
like a vaccine in
the first place?

613
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,295
And the reason that
it's such a good time

614
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:12,920
to think about these
sorts of questions

615
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,720
is that we can now
develop tools that

616
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,940
will let us study these
cellular ecosystems

617
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,160
at incredible resolution.

618
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,690
So just to give you a sense
of what is now possible,

619
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,130
because it seems relatively
science fiction-like we can take

620
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,700
a very small amount of cells--

621
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,370
so 50,000 cells, 20,000 cells,
the kinds of things that you

622
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,620
would have in fluids that
you might not even be aware.

623
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,750
So imagine scraping the
inside of your cheek.

624
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,880
Now rather than
saying that's too few,

625
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,630
we can actually load them into
innovative technologies-- many

626
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,130
of the ones that
you've seen earlier

627
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,760
that rely upon things like
microfluidics and new chemical

628
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,030
capture reagents.

629
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,230
And with these, we can actually
measure not one thing or two

630
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,690
things, but look at 20,000
plus variables at a time.

631
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,900
So really get a comprehensive
view of everything

632
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,410
that's happening in every cell.

633
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,088
And this gives us
the kinds of big data

634
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,630
that Caroline was talking about
earlier where we can actually

635
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,850
get a trillion data points just
from one individual sample.

636
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,522
And so just to make this a
little bit more real, what

637
00:31:05,522 --> 00:31:06,980
you can do is you
can take a tissue

638
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,880
like the retina, where it has
this beautiful multilayered

639
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,380
structure.

640
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,850
And you can see there's
multiple different cell types,

641
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,650
but we don't really know
what the components are.

642
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,230
We don't know what
their markers are.

643
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,600
We can load it into
one of these devices.

644
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,550
And for each cell,
we can measure

645
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,972
thousands of different genes.

646
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:22,430
And here I'm showing
you expression

647
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,200
of a gene being high as white.

648
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,603
Black means off.

649
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:27,020
What we can then
do is we can take

650
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,550
a set of cells that express
the same kind of programming.

651
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,040
And this, we think, might
be a specific cell type.

652
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,750
We can take one
of those markers,

653
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,260
go back and label it using
standard molecular biology

654
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,430
approaches, and
characterize it in situ.

655
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,460
And so what this
does is it takes us

656
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,400
from a place where it would have
taken us 30 years to identify

657
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,330
a cell type, its markers,
and characterize it

658
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,805
but now do it in a week.

659
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,430
But what's so impressive is that
we don't just do this one cell

660
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,430
type at a time.

661
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,490
Instead, we can look at every
single cell type that's up here.

662
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,950
So we're not compressing 30
years of research into a week.

663
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,908
We're compressing hundreds
of years of research

664
00:31:57,908 --> 00:31:59,090
into a single week.

665
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,810
So when you look at
something like this,

666
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,520
you can easily imagine why I
had to be at MIT as a professor

667
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,710
and was lucky when I
had the opportunity.

668
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,640
It's because I need incredible
multidisciplinary scientists

669
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,140
that are chemists, that are
engineers that really understand

670
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,300
how to apply this to
different contexts, that

671
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,100
can analyze the resulting data.

672
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,840
But it wasn't just MIT.

673
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,250
It was really that
I needed to be

674
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,260
embedded in this
incredible ecosystem

675
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,870
that you're all part of.

676
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,310
As you probably all know from
Phil's talk this morning,

677
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,300
MIT is surrounded by
this incredible community

678
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,090
of biotechs, of other
institutions, of hospitals,

679
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,607
of academic medical centers.

680
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,940
And what this does is it
creates an incredible ecosystem

681
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,030
in which to innovate.

682
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,220
And that's because,
like Colin said earlier,

683
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,713
the most important question
when you engineer is why?

684
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,630
And I interpret that a
little bit differently.

685
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,047
I think about that as exploring.

686
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:49,130
And what I mean by that
is really taking advantage

687
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,470
of this incredible ecosystem
and its willingness

688
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,310
to collaborate, to
go talk to people,

689
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,260
to identify problems
that matter.

690
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,057
So for example, by
talking to Sara Fortune

691
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:58,890
over at the Harvard
School of Public Health,

692
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,020
she said, well, that's great.

693
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,640
Have you ever thought about
applying it to something

694
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,920
like tuberculosis? which
you heard about from Brian

695
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,120
this morning.

696
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,350
Brian said 4,000 people a day.

697
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,570
It's 1.6 million people a year.

698
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,320
So that's more than any
other infectious disease

699
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,650
except for one year in COVID.

700
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,400
And this is literally
happening every year

701
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,490
and has been happening
for hundreds of years.

702
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,400
And about a quarter of
the world's population

703
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,360
is latently infected.

704
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,610
Now, the reason we don't
think about it quite so often

705
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,550
is because it happens that
the majority of infections

706
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,720
are in sub-Saharan Africa
and Southeast Asia,

707
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,960
as you heard about a
little from Bruce today.

708
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,180
So when you think about
the kinds of technologies

709
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,440
that you need, if you want
to tackle these problems,

710
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
well, you need things
that are deployable,

711
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,648
that can go out in the field.

712
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,523
You need them be scalable
so you can run them

713
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:40,600
across lots of patients.

714
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,640
You need them to be
low input, and you

715
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,057
need them to be
cheap so that they

716
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:45,820
can be used in all the different
contexts around the world.

717
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,340
And so once you have
the design constraints,

718
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,970
it's easy to go find incredible
partners like Chris Love over

719
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,890
at the Koch Institute
in chemical engineering

720
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,020
to take these really
cool machines that

721
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,450
look nice in our labs
at MIT, but could never

722
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,660
go out to where the
problem sites are

723
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,750
and re-engineer them into
really simple technologies that

724
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,440
accomplish the
goals that we have.

725
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,230
So we can take the
same kinds of things

726
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,120
that enable this
incredible discovery

727
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,699
and adapt it into really
simple portable chips that

728
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,679
can literally go
anywhere in the world.

729
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,360
What that does is
it then puts us

730
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,850
in a position where we
can go hop on a plane

731
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,960
and fly down to places
like South Africa--

732
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,630
and this is actually in
Durban, right at the site

733
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,949
that you heard about from Bruce
Walker earlier this morning--

734
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,770
and look at what's different
between individuals

735
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,330
that have more
mild or more severe

736
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,090
tuberculosis to find new
cellular targets that we

737
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,650
can use for therapies
to improve outcomes.

738
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,540
You don't just have
to go to South Africa.

739
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,748
You can actually start
applying these sorts of things

740
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:39,040
to all kinds of problems,
like pediatric stunting

741
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,770
due to malnutrition and
environmental infections

742
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,270
like environmental enteropathy.

743
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,100
And you find really
interesting things--

744
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,750
like, in the gut
right here we're

745
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,500
looking at the small
intestine-- and we're

746
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,949
finding that there are cells
that normally only show up

747
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:53,320
in the stomach, arising
in the small intestine

748
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,472
and preventing
absorption of nutrients.

749
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:56,889
And it gives us a
new idea of what

750
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,360
we might do to counteract it.

751
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,520
We can similarly go hop
on a plane to Thailand

752
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,110
with Sangetta's team,
who you just heard from,

753
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,650
and go and identify
new targets that we

754
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,800
could use to try and combat
specific stages of malaria

755
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,760
infection.

756
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,410
And what's really
cool is that when

757
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,570
you can do this, flying
all around the world

758
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,850
that your students get to
go-- and as I heard somebody

759
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,950
behind me say earlier,
it looks like that course

760
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,800
that Bruce teaches is really
fun, and it is really fun.

761
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,750
But you can also
improve everything

762
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,970
that we do here in Boston
because you make it simpler

763
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,700
to do things like partner with
people over at the Dana-Farber

764
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,550
to identify distinct
states of pancreatic cancer

765
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,920
and therapeutic treatment
regimes that will work better

766
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,220
for each.

767
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,100
And so engaging
people is important.

768
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,697
But a lot of what our roles are
as educators and in connecting

769
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,530
with people, as you
heard about from Andrew,

770
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,730
is to really empower.

771
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,393
And so what I like to think a
lot about is how we can go out

772
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:49,310
into the world inspired
by models like the one

773
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,400
you heard from
Bruce Walker today

774
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,740
and train people in
these technologies

775
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,360
so that they can apply
them to their own science

776
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,568
so that we can do more than
we could do independently

777
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:56,550
in our own lab.

778
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,150
And so I've been lucky enough
to go to a lot of places

779
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,640
with the team to train
individuals in places like Ghana

780
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,740
and Senegal in some
of these technologies

781
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,640
and to share what we've
learned along the way

782
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,057
so that others
that are interested

783
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,530
feel like they have at least a
place to start as they begin.

784
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,580
And another part of
really empowering people

785
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,570
is not just going out
and teaching them.

786
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,490
It's also working with the
innovation ecosystem around here

787
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,570
to take the widgets
that we build,

788
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,760
harden them and then sell them.

789
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,582
And I think that
commercialization

790
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:26,540
isn't the dirty secret.

791
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,070
And patenting isn't
the dirty secret.

792
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,945
There are things that
we do really well here.

793
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:32,430
We do that zero to one and
sometimes that one to 10.

794
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,810
But academia is a place that's
hard to go sometimes from 10

795
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,490
to 1,000.

796
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,890
And that's where partnerships
with local biotechs,

797
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,740
local industry,
with venture firms

798
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,230
becomes really critical to
having the kinds of impact

799
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,252
that we want to have
and, most importantly,

800
00:36:45,252 --> 00:36:46,710
figuring out what
the right targets

801
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,110
are to accelerate good
outcomes for patients.

802
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,570
So I think that, to me,
what's so powerful about being

803
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,460
MIT is this
opportunity to explore,

804
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,900
to identify good problems.

805
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,670
So what are you going to do?

806
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,210
The opportunity to engineer
with incredible colleagues

807
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,380
solutions that will work.

808
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,840
And then to engage
others in fun science,

809
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,870
and then to empower others to do
the same in their own research.

810
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,430
And I think that
this model needs

811
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,555
to be extended to a place
where we can tackle all

812
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:13,930
of the emerging problems that
are showing up in the world

813
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,500
today.

814
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,180
You heard about
some of them earlier

815
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,280
from people like Linda,
issues with women's health.

816
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,518
Unfortunately, this is
probably not the last pandemic

817
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:22,310
we're going to see.

818
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,740
We need to think about
children and their thriving.

819
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,230
We have issues at
the intersection

820
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,238
of global of human
health and global warming

821
00:37:28,238 --> 00:37:29,780
that we have to work
our way through.

822
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,300
And we have places
where we need to think

823
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,675
about how to care
for the elderly

824
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:35,330
and deal with
chronic conditions.

825
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,590
But I think that this model
that we can have here at MIT

826
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,230
taking advantage of this
incredible ecosystem

827
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,980
of biotechs, hospitals, and
surrounding academic centers

828
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,920
like HMS, puts us in a position
to actually really go after this

829
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,350
and to have transformative
impact for everybody everywhere.

830
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,660
And so with that, I just want
to thank some of our funders

831
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,910
and some of our collaborators.

832
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,577
There's too many to
throw on the screen.

833
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:01,430
But it's incredible
to be in a place

834
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,470
where this kind of
cooperation and partnership

835
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,860
is something that people love.

836
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,900
It's not should we do something?

837
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,110
It's can we do it
together and how?

838
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,600
And so thank you very much.

839
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,950
[APPLAUSE]

840
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,000
