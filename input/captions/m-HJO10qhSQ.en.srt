1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,480
we present Cleo a real time and task

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,440
driven approach to build open set 3D

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,640
scene graphs consider the problem of

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,279
building a metric semantic map of this

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,279
cluttered

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,720
cubicle what is the right granularity of

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,800
the objects to retain in the map for

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,840
instance is a single backpack an object

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,240
or is the zipper on the backpack an

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,440
object or maybe the two backpack should

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,120
be considered together as a single

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,520
object should these condiment packets be

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,480
mapped as a collective object two

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,520
objects for each type or individual

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,399
packets should this be a set of

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
notebooks or three

17
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,520
notebooks the correct scene

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,760
representation depends on the

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,520
task thus we present Cleo which creates

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,120
a task driven 3D scene graph including

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,359
task relevant objects and regions given

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,400
a set of natural language tasks

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,320
provided with these task Creo creates

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,560
the following objects for example

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,200
grouping the backpacks and condiments as

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,200
a collective

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,240
object making the task more detailed and

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,799
specific induces Cleo to split the map

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,799
into multiple objects including single

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,360
backpacks or similar types of

31
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:30,680
condiments given rgbd images Cleo's

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,119
front end forms object Primitives

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,000
Cleo's back end uses the information

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,920
bottleneck to Cluster Primitives and to

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,880
Tas relevant

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,079
objects task irrelevant objects can be

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,520
removed task relevant clusters are added

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:51,479
as objects to

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,600
Cleo Cleo similarly clusters places and

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,119
task relevant regions with the

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,119
information

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,200
bottleneck we provide visual results

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,039
showing Cleo mapping an office scene in

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,960
real time given the following task we

45
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,640
visualize the objects and regions in the

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,599
video objects are shown as cubes near

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
the

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,239
mesh places Primitives are shown as

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,680
Spears below the room regions they are

50
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,680
clustered

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,519
in we also demonstrate Cleo in an

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,519
apartment scene again in real time

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,239
to demonstrate Cleo at Large Scale we

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,920
mapped a five floor building in real

55
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,680
time mapped objects are shown with their

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,680
most relevant task

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,680
here we run Cleo on board spots laptop

58
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,680
spot first Maps a scene online in real

59
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,200
time then we will perform task execution

60
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,560
in the same session without any

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,560
postprocessing of the map

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,120
now we give spot a Target object to find

63
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,120
and grasp using

64
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:01,280
Cleo we run multiple object search and

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,280
grass task in total over 20

66
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,920
