1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,240
So thank you. My name is Zishan. I'm the

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,480
director of partnerships at Encountable.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,280
Um a unified laboratory informatics

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,080
platform that accelerates R&D for data

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,200
first approach. Um little bit connection

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,760
to MIT here. Um our out of the two found

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,400
three founders we have two went to MIT

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,199
null and will um but we also have Jason

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
who is was at Stanford and two are

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,119
computer scientists and one is a

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,439
material scientist. So what's going on

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,079
in our industry? The innovation gap is

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,239
about to explode. Around 45 million

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,360
technical workers will retire or leave

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,760
the industry by 2030, creating a huge

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,800
brain drain. On the other hand, AI

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,040
native R&D organizations that adopt AI

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,079
will cut development timelines by up to

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,800
50% by 2030.

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
Companies however that do not uh uh uh

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,520
do that investment and delay the data

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,920
infrastructure investment risk uh uh

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,160
lower innovation output by 20 to 30%.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,840
So what is actually broken in the in in

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,320
this whole product development cycle and

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,400
the R&D data is decentralized,

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,799
unstructured and fragmented. Probably

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
some of you still might use notebooks,

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,880
Excel sheets or um different systems

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,920
that do not connect together are siloed

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,880
um and do not have any context end to

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,000
end and provide any value from the work

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,560
you do. they solve a certain uh uh uh uh

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,079
solution but the enterprises never get

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,680
to see the end-to-end value of the data

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,079
and that is why we created uncountable

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,040
uh as a platform to centralize connect

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,119
and structure all types of R&D data with

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
our structured experiment and property

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,479
database that sits at the core of our

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,520
platform and lets a user and a scientist

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
um add information at the point of entry

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,320
in a structured format.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,759
without making them uh um sacrifice the

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,840
flexibility they need in their

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,600
innovation. So we have a limbs

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,000
capability, an ELN capability, uh

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,200
product life cycle management system

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
within our solution as well as QM and

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,480
most importantly what is used is we make

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,560
data actionable uh through reports that

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,280
uh and visualizations

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,319
and analytics and the holy grail that

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,560
everybody talks about today um AI and ML

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,080
specifically formulation predictions,

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,879
design of experiments and uh other AI

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,879
and ML ML tools based on the R&D data

58
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,599
that you have.

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,440
So what does good look like? So in our

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,519
world the the future of R&D is digital

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,920
and uh data is structured and

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
actionable. It lets the users and the

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,800
organization search, filter and track

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,360
experiments across projects and capture

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,080
data connected to instruments, equipment

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,560
and different data sources. Then you get

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
to leverage all your rich and clean data

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
to actually do machine learning and AI.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,360
And accountable has developed some

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,800
proprietary AI and machine learning

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,200
models allowing um organizations to do

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,239
certain uh uh um um

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,239
capabilities that then they could make

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
their products go to market faster and

75
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,159
that they could reduce their innovation

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,840
cycles. So this is just one example of

77
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,760
of something you can do within the

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,800
system once you have this the data

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,319
transferred to your system to our system

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,239
and it it really shows a lot of value to

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,400
end users. Let me talk a little bit

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,879
about that. One of the examples we use

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,879
we have done in the past is Blue Nalu.

84
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,080
It's a company out of San Diego working

85
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,959
on cultured meat or cultured fish. Um

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,360
and before uncountable they were um

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,920
doing a lot of time consuming

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,640
uh data recording. They had limited

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,959
coordination. The consistency there was

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
inconsistencies in in in in in the

91
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,239
system. So they had a lot of rework. Um

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,519
it was hard to retrieve and track u uh

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,080
um audit findings u um when regulators

94
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,560
came over and traceability was was

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,879
basically restricted. With Uncountable,

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,599
they were um able to have everything in

97
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,120
one place, create an overview of all

98
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
their experiments so that when the new

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,359
person came in, they could get started

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,359
right away and knew what they've done in

101
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,080
the past. Um they were able to

102
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,479
seamlessly track along the R&D process

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,080
and most importantly improve their R&D

104
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,759
efficiency by 25%. So all of this helped

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,440
them also in the end when they go for

106
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,560
regulatory compliance uh um get to

107
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,520
market faster. So what are we looking

108
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,840
for today? Um we're looking for any door

109
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,759
openers, organizations, new customers,

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,639
pilots and partnerships where we can

111
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,520
present our solution and enable them to

112
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,080
improve and centralize their R&D

113
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,320
capabilities. Um connect with corporates

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,960
to also support our regional and global

115
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,360
expansion and also do code development

116
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,080
to gain insights to develop our own tech

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,479
but and customize for customers. The

118
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,039
areas that we uh look at here are very

119
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,440
broad. So advanced materials, chemicals,

120
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,240
farm, biotech. And what we really want

121
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,720
to do here is co-create value for R&D

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
and enable digital transformation teams

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,960
to generate new opportunities for the

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,960
organization. Thank you very much.
