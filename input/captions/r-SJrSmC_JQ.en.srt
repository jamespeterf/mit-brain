1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:07,399
hi I'm Marcy black and um I got all all

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,920
three degrees at MIT so it's good to be

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,519
back home um did you know that

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,839
biomanufacturing over half of it is

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,560
dedicated to purifying out unwanted

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,480
impurities in the process and these

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,880
impurities can be toxic in even very

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,800
dilute quantities this leads to

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,080
unnecessary delays and costs in bringing

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,320
drugs and Therapeutics to Mar Market I

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,640
founded a co-founded Advanced silicon

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,000
group to help lower the barriers for

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,000
Diagnostics so that everyone has access

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to good

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Healthcare So currently the biofarma

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,160
manufacturing industry measures protein

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,520
using a technique called an Eliza

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,399
technique now Liza can sufficiently

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,239
measure the proteins but it's far from

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,440
ideal it's time consuming it takes about

21
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,600
4 hours of skilled labor time and it's

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,519
expensive it costs about $400 per test

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,199
and only measure one protein per test

24
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:08,240
we're developing a small silicon chip

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,640
that can do this 15 times faster and 15

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,080
times lower cost the end user will

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,479
simply put a drop of solution onto the

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,280
chip rinse it and then place it into our

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,640
handheld testing system to measure the

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,640
protein concentration of

31
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,759
Interest so this Market as I mentioned

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,240
for protein sensing is very large um and

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,960
there's a lot of pain points in the

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,880
market right now so there's a lot of

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
people developing new technology to try

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,640
to fill this Market need we do three

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,799
things different the first thing we do

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,240
is we do an electrical measurement

39
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,320
electrical measurements are are less

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,119
expensive than Optical um and if you

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
want to do a quantitative measurement

42
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,360
you really need to convert it to

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,880
electrical anyways in the end and also

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,040
electrical we we really good at

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,600
measuring very small signals with

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,000
electrical measurements so it can be

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,280
more sensitive the second thing we do

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,920
different is we use silicon and and as

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,680
you'll learn tomorrow um silicon has a

50
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,080
wide body of knowledge behind it um this

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
allows us to make use of this knowledge

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,160
and pack many different different tests

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,239
onto the same chip so we can measure

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,160
many different protein concentrations in

55
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,400
the same

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,840
test we can Multiplex also because we're

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,280
silicon compatible we can scale up to

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,280
manufacturing very easily and increase

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,040
the throughput pretty much as as much as

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,480
we want um the oh in addition because

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,840
and silicon we can make it very small

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,680
and the cost of biosensing is dominated

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,760
by the antibody or the or the aptamer

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,560
that's used to detect the the protein um

65
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,440
and since we're going small we can make

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
it low cost because we can use less

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,200
antibody the third thing we do different

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,280
is we use Nano structures or nanowires

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,879
and these have a very high surface area

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
to volume ratio that makes them very

71
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,159
sensitive to their environment and can

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,159
lead to very sensitive detection

73
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,319
so I already mentioned the Liza where

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,799
we're faster and cheaper um but there's

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,680
another uh protein test that's common

76
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,519
that I bet everyone is used and that's a

77
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,959
like a covid test a rapid antigen test

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,360
um those are useful but they have a

79
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,200
limit in how low a detection they can do

80
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,560
and also doing quantitative measurements

81
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,599
is difficult with those types of tests

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
so our sensor will combine the vantages

83
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,239
of both of these without the

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,519
disadvantage um and there's a lot of

85
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,319
markets for doing protein sensing a

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,040
pretty much any type of measurement that

87
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,120
you need that would be needs to be

88
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,959
sensitive multiplexed Rapid or low cost

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,840
our sensor might be a good fit for um

90
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,120
we're currently focused on the biofarma

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,879
manufacturing but we also have Partners

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,519
in other areas as well so for example

93
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,239
we're working with a company growing

94
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,760
nerve tissue and they want to use our

95
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,360
sensor to measure for biomarkers to tell

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,640
how well the the nerve tissue is growing

97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,400
um we're also working with a company uh

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,920
in India the cave Krishna Institute to

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,519
help them measure tubercul dormant Tu

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,640
tuberculosis in their patients and we're

101
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,200
also collaborating with several biofarma

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,000
companies uh Boston bib in the Boston

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,199
area and also another large biofarma

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
company both of which are interested in

105
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,160
using our sensor for measuring host cell

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,919
proteins and this is the most important

107
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,600
slide of the deck um we're here because

108
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,280
we're looking for partners we're looking

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,320
for people to uh scale up semiconductor

110
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,840
manufacturing with to to develop

111
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,280
antibodies or optimar with us custom

112
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,199
electrical testing biomedical device

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,000
design and biom manufacturers but also

114
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:44,360
anyone who could use a test a protein

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,360
test that's lowcost Multiplex and Rapid

116
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,320
um I have a couple of my uh a couple of

117
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,680
our amazing Engineers are here we have a

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,960
a booth and I welcome you to come visit

119
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,080
us and please join me in lowering the

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,160
barriers for Diagnostics so that

121
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,199
everyone has access to good Healthcare

122
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,720
thank

123
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,720
you thank you Mery
