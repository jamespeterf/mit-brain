1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,639
So I'm Sur. Uh nice to meet all of you.

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,840
Thanks for coming. Um so yeah as uh been

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,160
introduced I'm a machine learning

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,719
scientist in Gren's group at Genitech

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,960
and I'll be presenting our work on uh

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,039
that we call Nona. It's a model for

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,640
unifying functional genomics. That's how

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,880
we see it through multimodal masking.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,800
And uh I'll just set up what that means.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,119
But before that, I'd like to thank all

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
my amazing colleagues at Gentech who

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,960
helped me through different aspects of

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,040
this work.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
So, as Gchin alluded to in his awesome

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,120
primer, um you can kind of split the

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,680
main categories of um of of models for

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,600
regulatory DNA into broadly these three

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,160
subsets. the sequence to function

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,039
category which is uh has seen a lot of

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,600
interest in the last few years where you

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
um make predictions from sequence alone

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
and as cockin mentioned there are models

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,079
that they can starting from about 500 to

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,559
a,000 bases to models like inform and

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,879
bordoy that taken DNA sequence windows

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,119
as long as um half a megabase in some

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,840
cases there's also variations of these

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,360
frameworks where instead of predicting

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
from sequence alone you might predict

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
from sequence plus one or other

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
functional tracks

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,159
Um and one example of this could be

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,600
where you're trying to predict um gene

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,479
expression in a specific cellular

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,159
context from the DNA sequence and the

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,799
attack or some notion of chromatin

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
accessibility in the same cell type. And

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,240
then more recently what's really

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
exploded is is language modeling both

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,640
auto reggressive and mass language

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,840
models models like DNA bird caducious

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,600
EVO uh EVO 2 a nuclear nucleotide

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,680
transformer. There's all kinds of

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,280
different ways in which um people

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,079
tokenize, people uh design the the the

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,159
the masking objective. Um auto

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,840
reggressive versus

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,200
um masking based alo what species you're

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,360
training on can be completely different

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
species can be different individuals

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
within the same species. A lot of

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
different modeling challenges that are

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
involved in training these kinds of

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,960
models. So what we started thinking

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,040
about and what Gong should mention was

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,280
that all of these are being developed in

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,640
in in silos almost especially like

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
language modeling and sequence to

59
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,760
function models and if there's any way

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,440
to start unifying these models if you

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
were to train today a language model

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,280
you'll have to go to a completely

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,000
separate uh part of the internet or of

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
GitHub I guess and and set up uh a bunch

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
of tools and then get started with

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,959
language modeling going to do sequence

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
to function you do a completely

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
different set of data processing and and

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
training um for these. So as we start

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,000
thinking about the process of unifying

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,360
these almost disparit

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
um modeling approaches, we realize that

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
in the process of unification, we can

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
actually start doing uh things that are

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,680
actually none of these. we can start

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,920
going beyond um these these um highly

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,160
siloed classes of models and we can do

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,720
something that's more interesting uh and

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,840
spans and is is almost some kind of

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,840
hybrid or um hybrid approach that you

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
wouldn't classify into any one of these

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,879
categories. So maybe to motivate that a

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,120
bit further um I want to show you uh an

84
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,360
example of a text vision uh multi

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
multimodal mass model. is one of the

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,840
places where we draw our inspiration

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
from. Um, and the way these models work

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,720
is you have pairs of images and

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,560
captions. And you can think of

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,920
arbitrarily masking patches in your

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,680
image um or or tokens in your text and

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
then filling those in. And the model is

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
able to look across modalities and look

94
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,239
at correlation between the text and the

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,799
images and fill those in um going across

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,680
modalities. And what's nice about this

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,319
kind of framework is it captures the

98
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,319
more common separate models that you see

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,120
um things like captioning an image right

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,239
this is an entire class of models on its

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,400
own but is encompassed in this broader

102
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,120
framework of multimodal mass modeling

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,720
where you could um for example train a

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,519
model by simply masking all the text

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
tokens um and predicting them condition

106
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,200
on the image or you can go the other way

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,319
around where you try to generate an

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,080
image given um tokens in the text,

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,760
right? But you can also go beyond this.

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,560
You can do some interesting things where

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,040
you're editing the text. You're masking

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,359
specific patches of your image that help

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,160
you edit uh the image itself. So, it's

114
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,759
it's not exactly captioning or image

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,840
generation. It's some kind of an in

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
between task, but also interesting in

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,639
its own right. And I think if you tried

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,040
um giblifying your images, you kind of

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,360
know what I'm talking about uh from the

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,639
last week. So this is where we draw our

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,639
inspiration from and coming back to um

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,280
functional genomics you can really think

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,240
of two broad modalities. The first is

124
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,080
DNA sequence and the second modality is

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
all our functional tracks. Although you

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,080
may also wish to call RNA seek a

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,960
completely different modality from

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,479
attack seek which um it probably is but

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,560
for now you can think of it broadly as

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,880
DNA sequence and all your functional

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,680
tracks. What's nice and it's a little

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,199
different from the text um and image

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,039
case is that these share a common

134
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
coordinate system right? So when you do

135
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,199
attack or RNA seek you get reads you

136
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
align these reads to the genome and then

137
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,919
at every position in the genome every

138
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,680
base you get some um read count for your

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,479
asset right. So it's really nice and you

140
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,479
can represent it in this matrix form

141
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,320
where you have sequence typically one

142
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,160
hot encoded um for four channels for ACG

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,280
and T and then the tracks you're

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,680
considering uh as as a one-dimensional

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,919
vector uh with the same length as the

146
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,759
length of the sequence and and nicely

147
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,479
aligned for you.

148
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,759
So the crux of Nona really is a

149
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,960
multimodal masking based model um where

150
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,120
we have our matrix of of uh different

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,280
different functional tracks and DNA

152
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,800
sequence and in theory we can

153
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,560
arbitrarily mask individual pixels um

154
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,280
both across the tracks or the tasks um

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,680
and the DNA and then kind of jointly

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,000
fill those in fill in the missing pixels

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,960
based on what else you see. Right? So

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,039
this is um

159
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
seems to be like crazy flexible approach

160
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,280
which it is and I'll try to now make

161
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
more sense of it in the next few slides.

162
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,039
Um but I hope you can start to see how

163
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
this is already unifying different

164
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,759
approaches in one larger class of

165
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,759
models.

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,720
Great. So you can now start thinking of

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,120
how you can encode the first you know

168
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,680
three different classes of models I'd

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,360
shown you within this single framework

170
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,919
and then I'll also show you how we can

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,280
come up with entirely new classes of

172
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,280
models or or or um or types of models

173
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,039
that don't fit neatly into any of the

174
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,759
the first three buckets I've shown you

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:54,000
right uh operationally the way Nona is

176
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,400
working is we have our data matrix um

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,639
and we mask out positions in our data

178
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
matrix with zeros. So if there was some

179
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
non-zero value, it becomes zero. If

180
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,759
there was a base there, there will be a

181
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,440
base there or unless I guess there's

182
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,759
issues with the reference genome. You

183
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
convert that into zeros with an n. And

184
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,240
then in addition to that, you also

185
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,720
append a a mask matrix. It's just a

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,840
binary matrix of ones and zeros where

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,479
it's one where uh the specific pixel was

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,639
not masked in the input. The reason for

189
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,520
doing this is so that the model can

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,639
differentiate between zeros in the data

191
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,599
matrix caused from masking versus zeros

192
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,000
that um are actually observed uh at this

193
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,000
specific position.

194
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,800
So sequence to function modeling now

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,199
just becomes um an instantiation of an

196
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,199
owner model where you mask all your

197
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
tracks uh and you keep your sequence

198
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,160
unmasked. Right? So very simple case

199
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
where um during training what you can do

200
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,919
is have a bunch of tracks you mask all

201
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
of them out and you only predict those

202
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,080
from sequence alone.

203
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
If you want to add more tracks to your

204
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
sequence you can simply do this really

205
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,160
in a dynamic fashion right you can

206
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,919
dynamically unmask different tracks um

207
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
when you're training or during inference

208
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,639
and then predict the rest. So you can

209
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,080
have perhaps sequence plus attack seek

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
in skin cells and then try to predict

211
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,919
the gene expression in skin cells or all

212
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
and or all other cell types as well. Um

213
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
language modeling in the case of

214
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,039
language modeling here what you could do

215
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,960
is either remove all your tracks or if

216
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,880
you have some tracks you can completely

217
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,680
mask them and then ignore them in terms

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,640
of your loss function. Um and what you

219
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,599
then do is just mask at specific bases

220
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,640
here. Um, and this this kind of

221
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,600
recapitulates um your masking uh your

222
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,560
your masking based uh language modeling.

223
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,480
So pretty straightforward. But now that

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,160
we've set this up, we can actually do a

225
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
lot more than just these three things,

226
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,160
right? I'm going to show you some

227
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,720
examples of of of things that we've

228
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
thought about that um have been

229
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,080
specifically motivated by downstream

230
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,360
applications uh in functional genomics.

231
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,959
So one thing we've been thinking about

232
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,279
is what we call contextaw aware

233
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,760
prediction in which the input of the

234
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,160
model is not just the sequence but also

235
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,399
the functional measurements adjacent to

236
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
some region of interest and I'm going to

237
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,839
talk about this specific mode in more

238
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,399
detail in the next section. Um but just

239
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,880
to set this up it's it there can be use

240
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,720
cases where you might want to factor in

241
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,800
uh information beyond just the sequence

242
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,399
itself. We have all our attack and RNA

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,560
seek measurements across cellular

244
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,560
contexts. other ways to make better use

245
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,680
of them when when you're trying to make

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,560
um predictions in a region of interest.

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,240
Um, another interesting mask we've

248
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
thought about is what we call positional

249
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,000
masking where we mask out these

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,760
functional tracks um at specific at at

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,760
random at at bases at random. Um, and

252
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,440
what this kind of a mask can help us

253
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,800
potentially is is filling in what's uh

254
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
these functional tracks at these

255
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
specific positions from the sequence,

256
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,480
but also the functional measurements at

257
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,399
other bases. And you can think of ways

258
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,040
where this might be useful for denoising

259
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,440
tracks, especially those that have um

260
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,360
either high noise or or or low read

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,800
depth.

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,560
And we can also extend uh traditional

263
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,519
sort of vanilla mass language modeling

264
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,920
into what we call functional language

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,440
modeling here. Instead of completely

266
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,839
ignoring all the functional tracks and

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,440
the wealth of data we have uh we can

268
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,519
actually factor those into our mass

269
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760
language modeling approach. So instead

270
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,920
of masking out all our tracks, we also

271
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
provide the model access to our tracks

272
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,200
only mask out specific bases and fill

273
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,360
those in not just from the sequence but

274
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,160
also uh from the tracks that we

275
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
observed. But hopefully I'm starting to

276
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,000
convince you that this is a fairly

277
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,079
flexible worst style approach uh almost

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,320
a Swiss army knife of sorts of function

279
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,320
genomics. If you have an interesting

280
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
application in mind, you can come up

281
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,519
with a nice masking strategy and train a

282
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,680
model uh that hopefully tackles um the

283
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
use case you have in mind. going to

284
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
pause here but what I'll be doing in the

285
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,800
next few uh minutes I guess the next

286
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,120
half an hour or so is walk through three

287
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,279
completely different use cases of of

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,880
Nona in which we'll be training three

289
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,040
very different kinds of models so it's

290
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,680
almost like three flash three different

291
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,959
flash talks unrelated from each other so

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
hopefully you can get a sense for the

293
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,600
versatility and breadth of um the

294
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,160
approaches we have but good time to ask

295
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,160
questions if any

296
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,440
did you try training three tasks

297
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,040
together. Can you see generalization

298
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
across different tasks when you do that?

299
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,480
It's it's a great question. So we have

300
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,399
um in today's talk I'll be showing you

301
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
cases where we just train on one kind of

302
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,360
mask at one time. We have experimented

303
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,880
with training multiple uh kinds of masks

304
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
in the same model and that does work to

305
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,800
some extent. Um so far what we've seen

306
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
is that if you want optimal performance

307
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,000
on any one specific kind of masking it's

308
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,880
better to either fine-tune on that or or

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,640
train exclusively on that. I don't think

310
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,839
we have seen some instances where we can

311
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,200
generalize across masks. So if you have

312
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,600
a mask that you haven't seen during

313
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,079
training that is somewhat related that

314
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,959
is some sense of but we haven't really

315
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,240
gotten into that in detail.

316
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,959
Um so in the multimod like vision tech

317
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,160
stuff people um many models like

318
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,560
tokenize the modalities yeah separately.

319
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,480
Um

320
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,240
I guess you'll talk more about that kind

321
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,160
of thing and do do you see that as the

322
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,399
tokenization etc being constant

323
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
throughout these different section or do

324
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,639
you think it like depends on the yeah so

325
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,600
I think as I mentioned we're sharing a

326
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,200
common coordinate system which uh almost

327
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,360
makes it easy to represent what's going

328
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,240
on locally within an within a genomic

329
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,839
window. Um

330
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,440
and I think this just keeping in spirit

331
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,040
with the kinds of models you've seen in

332
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,399
the space where we just either doing

333
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,639
sequence to function prediction without

334
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,120
any kind of tokenization predicting from

335
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,240
raw DNA sequence itself. It's an

336
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,720
interesting we've thought about it but

337
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,880
yeah I haven't explored that in

338
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,240
might be jumping the gun a bit but uh we

339
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,120
heard that in sequence to function

340
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,720
models um they're somewhat limited by um

341
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
the counterfactuals being on the

342
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,160
sequence the perturbations. um is

343
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,760
another motivation for this model also

344
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,680
being able to perturb the tracks and

345
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,680
seeing changes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah,

346
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,480
I think it's a bit related to Sil's

347
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,040
question. Um I mean there's not an

348
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,200
implicit tokenization in inform but the

349
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,839
convolutions to that and reduce the the

350
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,000
size to 128 bases, right? Where there's

351
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,320
the the scale the functional scale where

352
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,680
I don't know chips would might vary. I

353
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
mean, doesn't that constrain a lot the

354
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
size of your sequences and the size of

355
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,639
your inputs? Um, so I guess it would

356
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,160
kind of make sense. So the models I'll

357
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,680
be showing you today, some of especially

358
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,000
in the first subsection in the first

359
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
section are really long about 200 KB and

360
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,600
we're able to model these at base

361
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,199
resolution. So within our unit

362
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
architecture, we can go all the way back

363
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,959
to single base resolution. And you're

364
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
right that there are some constraints.

365
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,279
We probably can't model a few thousand

366
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,800
or tens of thousands of tracks. Um, but

367
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,519
in the range of a few hundred, it's

368
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,519
quite doable.

369
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,920
Great. So I'm going to move ahead uh

370
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,320
into the first um section. Thanks for

371
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,399
the questions. Um into what we call a

372
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,240
context aware uh nona model, right? So

373
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,800
to set this up, sequence to function

374
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,199
models predict these assays like DNA

375
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,839
seek attack seek RNA seek from sequence

376
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,360
alone. What if we provided the models

377
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,120
more information? Could there be cases

378
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,560
where this might be uh useful?

379
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,480
uh especially if there's some event of

380
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
interest that's somewhat localized um

381
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
some kind of integration or or a

382
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,279
mutation for example

383
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,800
um so maybe one way to think about it is

384
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,160
let's say you have a reported gene of

385
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,399
interest and you know you're going to

386
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,120
integrate it at some specific locus in

387
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,440
the genome but you want to predict how

388
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,959
much once upon integration what the

389
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
expression level of this gene is going

390
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,959
to be right

391
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
um and so this would be a function of

392
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,959
the promoter sequence of the gene and

393
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,519
also the genomic environment or the

394
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,320
sequence um and the accessibility and

395
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,079
other factors and chromatin state of the

396
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,880
locus into which it's integrated. Right?

397
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,320
Other enhancers may interact with the

398
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,800
promoter once it's um inserted into this

399
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
um specific genomic coordinate. The

400
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
sequence to function way to make this

401
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,120
prediction would be to take the sequence

402
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,360
of the site of integration, insert the

403
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,199
sequence of the reporter gene um and

404
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,079
then run it through a model like boroy

405
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,959
or infirma and look at the predicted RNA

406
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,880
seek or cage um values in the cell type

407
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,519
of interest. Right? But the hypothesis

408
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,040
we have here is can we do better if we

409
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,199
add additional information. So we

410
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,800
already know something about this

411
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,720
specific locus beyond the sequence

412
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,880
itself from our measurements. So we

413
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,959
perhaps know that there's an attack seek

414
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,759
peak 20 KB upstream of this and another

415
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,839
one 80KB downstream. Is there any way to

416
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,639
factor this in um in this specific uh

417
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,440
make these kinds of predictions? Right.

418
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,959
So to test this we trained um a context

419
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,839
aware model for K562 uh the K562 cell

420
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,920
line. Uh and in this model we have nine

421
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,600
tracks, seven DNA seek tracks and two

422
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,320
gauge tracks um which a subset of the

423
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,240
larger set of tracks that enfor

424
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
um and we train our model in two stages.

425
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
In the first we this is all done within

426
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,040
the nona framework. So you can just

427
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,720
switch the masks up um at different

428
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,639
stages of your training really. So in

429
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,320
the first stage we're doing a sequence

430
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,959
to function training with a 196 uh KB

431
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,639
input window and nine tracks. um and

432
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,519
these nine tracks. In the second stage,

433
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,519
we fine-tune this model with our context

434
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,560
aware masking mode in which we're

435
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,160
masking only the central 4KB. Um and so

436
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,519
the model has access in these

437
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,160
predictions to the sequence um and 192

438
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,639
KB of measurements around in regions

439
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,679
adjacent to the the central um mast

440
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,439
area. Um and it's trained on the same

441
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,120
genomic regions. So both these models

442
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,280
are trained. What's the only thing that

443
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,679
changes when you go from part one to

444
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,439
part two is the masking, right? Nothing

445
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,799
else really changes. The loss and

446
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,199
everything else stays more or less the

447
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,280
same.

448
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,760
And so what we can see here is the

449
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,640
prediction on the test set for these

450
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,960
nine tracks uh when you're predicting

451
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,240
with just the sequence only mode of of

452
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,640
Nuna or the contextaware mode of Nona.

453
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,760
And you can see across the board um

454
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,320
pretty uh decent increase in performance

455
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,799
for all the DNA seek um prediction tasks

456
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,640
as well as the gene expression um gauge

457
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,919
tracks which suggests that as you'd

458
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,840
expect adding the um context information

459
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,919
does give you a bump over the sequence

460
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,280
only. Um I just um curious about what

461
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,640
happens if you don't include the

462
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,600
sequence. So if just context only

463
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,960
prediction do these are these better or

464
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,200
yeah what what are the what are the

465
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,280
numbers here like yeah uh don't try that

466
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,600
explicitly I would imagine it's uh

467
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,600
somewhat lower because you would need to

468
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,720
know for example if there's a DSS of a

469
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,080
gene in the central mast region right if

470
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
you don't have access to the sequence

471
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
you wouldn't even know if there's a TSS

472
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,679
of a gene so you may not be able to

473
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,520
predict gene expression in the first

474
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,919
case so Um my expectation is it'll be

475
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,919
fairly low.

476
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,679
Great. So um when we look at the

477
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,000
differences between the predictions of

478
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,720
these two models for one specific track

479
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
in this case DNA seek and K562 you can

480
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,880
see that the predictions are more or

481
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,919
less tightly correlated except for this

482
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,240
set of about 2% of regions where the

483
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,240
predictions of the context aware model

484
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,039
differ significantly from the sequenceon

485
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,280
model. in fact in this case um are much

486
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,240
lower than the predictions of the

487
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,760
sequence only mode. Um and this one

488
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,120
specific locus where we see this

489
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,440
phenomena um at this specific locus the

490
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,039
sequence only model predicts kind of

491
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,360
across the board high regulatory

492
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,400
activity. So it thinks there's a strong

493
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,640
uh DNA seek peak chromatin access region

494
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
of accessible chromatin here another one

495
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
here and another one here. But if you

496
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
look at the actual data and this is a

497
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,480
test set example. So if you look at the

498
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,120
actual measured data, you see there's

499
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,799
there's no regulatory activity here,

500
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,600
very little regulatory activity in the

501
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,520
other positions and also in the central

502
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,840
uh 4KB. So if you kind of zoom into the

503
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,280
central 4KB, you can see that the model

504
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,760
really thinks there's a lot going on

505
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,960
here in terms of accessibility, but

506
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,799
there just isn't as much going on. Um

507
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
and so what the context aware model will

508
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,039
do in this case is have access to the

509
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,880
same sequence as the sequence only model

510
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,440
but also look at the fact that there's

511
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,440
overall reduced accessibility

512
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,600
um in the in the adjacent flanking

513
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
areas. And so when you use the context

514
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,400
aware model it seems to reduce its

515
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,320
prediction compared to the sequence only

516
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,160
prediction. Although not completely

517
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,480
ablating it entirely it does seem to

518
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,080
move towards the right direction. And

519
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,880
for those of you fairly familiar with

520
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,799
chromatin states and and and the like,

521
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,880
what we see is that this specific locus

522
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,080
seems to be enriched for hetrochromatin

523
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,280
marks. These are just chromm state um

524
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,880
tracks for a bunch of K562 samples and

525
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,000
see a lot of enrichment for

526
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,640
hetrochromatin and and and ZNF repeats.

527
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,039
But overall we seem to uh if when we do

528
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,480
this analysis more globally we do see uh

529
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,640
an enrichment of of heterocchromatin or

530
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,720
other repressive marks in region where

531
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,280
the context aware models predictions

532
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,799
differ from the sequence only model.

533
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,080
So um we try to do a a different kind of

534
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,919
evaluation a one that reflects um how

535
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,559
we'd like to use this model for a

536
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,000
downstream application. Um and the kinds

537
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,159
of data sets um that are a good fit is

538
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,640
something called tripseek

539
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,559
um I think it's called thousands of

540
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,559
reporters in parallel assay. Yeah,

541
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,480
that's why it's called tripseek. And the

542
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,720
the way trips works is you have some

543
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,799
promoter and reporter gene construct

544
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,880
that you insert randomly um at basically

545
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,200
a different loi in different cells

546
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,840
somewhat at random um and then you

547
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
measure the expression of the promoter

548
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,559
and reporter gene once it's been

549
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,159
integrated into those contexts. And so

550
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,760
the differences in expression would

551
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,200
largely be driven by um the the

552
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,919
chromatin state or the genomic

553
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,919
environment within which this uh gene

554
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,400
was integrated into. Okay. And so what

555
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,280
we end up at the end of this experiment

556
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,000
is the coordinate of integration and the

557
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,720
gene expression measurement um for this

558
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,960
reporter gene. Right? And we people

559
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,640
typically integrate the same promoter in

560
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,400
a few hundred to a few thousand

561
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
different positions, make these

562
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,919
measurements and then also repeat this

563
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,720
for a bunch of different promoters. So

564
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,679
housekeeping versus a um a more cell

565
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,840
type specific promoter.

566
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,919
Um and the way we would run these

567
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,000
through our models is simply the

568
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,960
reporter's sequence is about 2kb in

569
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,720
length. So we can um integrate that in

570
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,440
uh we can insert that into the sequence

571
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,280
of interest at the site of integration

572
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,080
um in the case of a sequence only model.

573
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,600
In the context aware case we will append

574
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,159
the measured functional tracks outside

575
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,720
the 4 KB uh in the center which will

576
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,880
contain 2 KB uh from the reported

577
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,760
sequence itself. So here the model

578
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,760
seeing the sequence post integration and

579
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,080
then also seeing prior to integration

580
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,840
what the chromatin landscape look like

581
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,440
and kind of assuming that that doesn't

582
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,760
change much after integration. Um

583
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,720
and so what you can then do is look at

584
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,520
the prediction of the models um with and

585
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
without the context information. So for

586
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,679
this one specific promoter that was

587
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,840
integrated in about 600 sites in the

588
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
genome, you get a bunch of um gene

589
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,840
expression measurements um and then you

590
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,600
get predictions from both our models.

591
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,320
And you can look at the correlation

592
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,000
between the measurements and the uh

593
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,640
prediction in both of these cases. And

594
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,960
we see reasonable increase in in

595
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,440
accuracy going from the sequence only

596
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,840
mode to the context aware mode. And you

597
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,320
can repeat this for a bunch of promoters

598
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,320
and we see a similar pattern on average.

599
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,080
There are some promoters that we don't

600
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,960
seem to do better on, but there are

601
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,600
others where we um see reasonable gains

602
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,280
on. And then you can also repeat this

603
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,280
with another more recent uh data set um

604
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,960
and you more or less see the same trends

605
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,000
where adding information about the

606
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,360
context seems to help you predict the

607
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,440
expression levels of integrated

608
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,000
reporters um better.

609
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,159
So that was the first um flash talk I

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,360
guess um and I've hopefully shown you

611
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,799
that a context aware nona model uh can

612
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,960
integrate information beyond the

613
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,559
sequence and specifically integrate

614
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,480
information about functional

615
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,960
measurements around the central region

616
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,039
of interest. Great. So we're going to

617
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,400
switch now to functional language

618
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,679
modeling. Um and as I mentioned before,

619
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,880
what we're doing in this mode is

620
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,760
extending mass language modeling um by

621
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,279
conditioning on additional functional

622
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,000
tracks. In this case, let's start off

623
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,400
with a simple one track example where

624
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,320
you have measurement from one track.

625
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,520
Let's say attack DNA seek in one

626
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,679
specific cell type. You mask um some

627
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,440
fraction of bases. Then you fill those

628
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,120
in. In all of these cases, you're

629
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
presenting the entire track to the

630
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,279
model, but you're only masking some

631
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,840
bases in the sequence. Doing this at

632
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,840
single base resolution.

633
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,960
And so we started training some of these

634
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,960
models to see what they're aarning and

635
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,720
then what we could do with these um

636
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,960
kinds of mass language models that are

637
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,760
aware of that are that are functionally

638
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,320
informed. Uh

639
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,360
and so we started off with a 512

640
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,279
baselong model, fairly short. Um and the

641
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,240
track of interest in this case was DNA

642
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,320
seek in in GM12878 which is a blood

643
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,760
derived cell line and what we do during

644
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,000
training which is a little distinct from

645
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,640
how models like BERT are trained is we

646
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,480
used a uniform masking rates so uh

647
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,880
uniform between zero and zero and one

648
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,520
and so in some examples you might mask

649
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,159
as high as 90% of your bases and in some

650
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,919
you might mask as low as 5% of your

651
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,840
bases and I'll show you why this is

652
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,919
useful when we talk about how we can use

653
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,080
these models to generate regulatory

654
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,080
elements.

655
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,640
So the first question we have is is what

656
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
are these functional language models

657
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,000
learning? Are they even different from

658
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,320
what mass language models are learning?

659
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,360
And uh if we can make any sense of them.

660
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,159
So the simplest thing we thought of was

661
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,840
to just mask one base at a time and then

662
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,960
look at the model's predictions for that

663
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,080
base. So conditioned on some profile of

664
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,240
um DNA seek in this case GM1287 GDNA

665
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,720
seek. Let's say we know this region is

666
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,600
an accessible region in in uh JM1287A

667
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,240
and given everything except one base in

668
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,240
this um at this locus what do the

669
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,760
model's predictions look like and we'd

670
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,000
like to differentiate between two major

671
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,159
cases where the model is kind of unsure

672
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,039
or it's just giving you the base the

673
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,400
baseline distribution of AC's gs and ps

674
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,720
versus where the model is quite

675
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,080
confident of the base um at this

676
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,799
position. So whether it's a flat

677
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,279
distribution versus somewhat peaky and

678
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,679
we can quantify this by just looking at

679
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,080
uh 2 minus the entropy at this site

680
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,320
which would be higher for cases where

681
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,400
distribution is more peaky and uh lower

682
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,520
where it's flatter and the entropy here

683
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:50,279
is just the standard sum of negative sum

684
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,279
of p and p log p

685
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,159
and so the way you would run this

686
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,039
interpretation analysis then would be

687
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,159
for the same uh locus so the same track

688
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,840
and the same sequence. You you mask one

689
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,080
base at a time. So you go across a

690
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,799
sequence masking one base at a time. You

691
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,159
compute this two minus entropy value and

692
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,200
then you just concatenate them all

693
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,279
together to get some sense of what

694
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,840
positions in this input sequence is the

695
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,279
model paying more attention to or or or

696
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,320
has stronger predictions um as is making

697
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,799
more confident predictions about.

698
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,039
And so I'm showing you one specific 512

699
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,880
long sequence which you can't probably

700
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,200
read which is totally fine at this

701
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,559
point. Uh and then the the GM12878

702
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,440
signal. So you can see there's a peak.

703
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,720
So this specific sequence comes from an

704
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,480
accessible chromatin region in GM12878.

705
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,159
And now what you can do is scale each

706
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,039
base in this uh very small sequence or

707
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,960
very narrow sequence by the two minus

708
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,120
entropy values that I showed you before.

709
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,520
And when you do that, it kind of starts

710
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,080
it clears up, right? So you see um

711
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,039
higher scores kind of localized almost

712
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,440
DNA words in some sense um shooting up

713
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,679
and we're just centering the two minus

714
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,520
entropy scores subtracting the mean to

715
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,880
make it a little more clean. Now I'm

716
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,039
going to zoom in now so you can finally

717
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,720
read the sequences especially those of

718
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,120
you that can recognize transcription

719
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,360
factor motifs by I is a good time for

720
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,919
you. Um, but what we're seeing is that

721
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,559
the model is picking up on on on

722
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,919
specific DNA words. Um, and I'm going to

723
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,679
show you actually these are well-known

724
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,679
features of DNA and these are quite well

725
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,679
annotated. I'll just tell you what these

726
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,600
are. So the first one is actually a

727
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,080
simple repeat. It's a micro satellite

728
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,320
and you can see the sequence is a GCC

729
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,039
GCC repeat about seven or eight times

730
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,559
it's been repeated. Um, and then it

731
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
makes sense, right? These kinds of

732
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,520
simple repeats are scattered through the

733
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,679
genome. If I just mask one base, if I

734
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,200
just mask this G here, it's going to be

735
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,480
pretty easy for me to predict that yeah,

736
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,799
there should be a G here because I'm

737
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,360
seeing the GCC pattern repeat on both

738
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,880
sides. Right? So that quite that very

739
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,039
simply explains why the model is able to

740
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,960
be more confident in its predictions at

741
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,600
this microatellite

742
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,000
um or this microatellite sequence or

743
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,159
motif if you will. Um but this just like

744
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,679
some kind of idiosyncrasy of the genome.

745
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,440
It's not really functionally relevant.

746
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,120
It's not that it's a transcription

747
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,120
factor binding site in this case that's

748
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,080
that's causing the uh the region to be

749
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,000
accessible in in GM12878.

750
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,640
But what's even more interesting is

751
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,320
these other DNA words or motifs actually

752
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,480
correspond to known transcription factor

753
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:36,000
binding sites. So this GCC and GCC's is

754
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,159
is an SP or a KF motif and these others

755
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,559
are are NFY motif. So these are quite

756
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,080
well annotated. So have you compared

757
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,679
these motifs that are picked up here

758
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,000
versus the motifs that would be picked

759
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,440
up with the gradient times method and

760
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,159
how do they compare and happen? I don't

761
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,000
have the slides here but yeah the short

762
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,720
answer is you see these SP and NFI

763
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,039
motifs but not the micro satellite and

764
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,440
do you have any intuition as to why? Um

765
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,000
so yeah I mean the SP and FI motifs are

766
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,440
known to cause accessibility right so

767
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
they are associated with increased

768
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,360
accessibility having this motif means

769
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,120
that a transcript factor is binding

770
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,880
there and is bringing other

771
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,559
transcription factors and keeping the

772
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,440
region open and accessible. There's also

773
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,679
a um a promoter sequence actually. So

774
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,440
you can see so if you look at a sequence

775
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,080
to function model um and make

776
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,840
predictions with it you're going to see

777
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,840
mostly these motifs but not the micro

778
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,840
satellite.

779
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,200
Um I also have a related question which

780
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,440
is do you see what are some of the

781
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,760
motifs that like you feel like you can't

782
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,760
actually like learn and uncover because

783
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,120
obviously there are things that are easy

784
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,000
to find and there are things that maybe

785
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,360
are a little bit harder. Yeah. Uh I mean

786
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,600
I don't think they're specific to these

787
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,080
language models but there are certain

788
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,640
zinc fingers for example that don't bind

789
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,200
a lot. They maybe bind

790
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,960
tens or a few hundreds of sites. I think

791
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,600
those are some kinds of sequence

792
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,679
features that you wouldn't be able to

793
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
learn just because it's a very rare

794
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,600
event. But any transcription factor

795
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,760
that's fairly pervasive binds promoters

796
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,080
or enhancers you should and we have seen

797
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,200
in many contexts you are able to pick

798
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,760
these models. Um given that you know

799
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,320
like the uh DNA language models are like

800
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,559
zero shot predictors. Yeah. Have you

801
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,240
tried doing this entropy but with just

802
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,480
the next slide. Yeah. Thanks. So yeah we

803
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,039
looked at Kaducius which is a mass DNA

804
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,960
language model completely unconditional.

805
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,559
Uh and what's interesting is it does

806
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,480
pick up the micro satellite but not the

807
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,399
transcription factor binding sites. Um

808
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,399
which somewhat makes sense. These are

809
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,799
well you would so we we do know that

810
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,039
these DNA language models pick up

811
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,799
features like start codons and um

812
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:51,600
sometimes even a CTCF motif um but don't

813
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,200
really pick up much beyond that. And

814
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
yeah one reason for that is they aren't

815
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,799
really informed by any functional

816
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,279
measurements. Um and as Gokchin

817
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,720
mentioned the transcription factors

818
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,640
relevant in different cell types are

819
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,200
different and they aren't necessarily

820
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,519
under strong constraints as much as say

821
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,080
a start codon is or or um genic features

822
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,480
are. Um and so I think that might

823
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,880
explain why a language model like

824
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,880
kadouch is not able to pick this up. So

825
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,320
once we've established that our model is

826
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,840
learning meaningful uh features of DNA,

827
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,000
not not just the idiosyncrasies like

828
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,120
microatellites and other repeats but

829
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,440
also motifs. uh we wondered if we can

830
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,919
repurpose this mass language model uh

831
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,159
for designing regulatory elements and as

832
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,679
Gobchin mentioned um synthetic

833
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,360
regulatory element design has kind of

834
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,960
taken off um in the last few years many

835
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,120
approaches um across organisms and even

836
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,960
different ML methodologies including

837
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,799
some from our group as well have have

838
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,039
been demonstrated in this area and

839
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,320
overall quite exciting and there's a

840
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,320
very simple way to um

841
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,720
uh to to generate sequence is from a

842
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,039
mass language model. And this hopefully

843
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
ties back to the fact that I mentioned

844
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,039
the fact I mentioned about using a

845
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,880
uniform masking rate. Since the model is

846
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,039
more or less uh comfortable with any

847
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,720
masking or dropout rate, you can then

848
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,799
use it in in uh in a sequential way to

849
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,799
generate sequences from scratch. So

850
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,640
conditioned on some specific profile.

851
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,039
Let's say we want to generate something

852
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,159
that's um a peak in a specific cell

853
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,480
type. You can start off with a

854
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,640
completely empty sequence. So you mask

855
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,240
all the bases in your sequence and then

856
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,080
you make a prediction with your model.

857
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,000
You pick a position, look at the

858
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,519
predicted distribution, sample from it

859
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,840
or do something more interesting

860
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,679
potentially. Now you selected one base

861
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,080
and then you send that back into the

862
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,640
model, make predictions again, choose a

863
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,159
position, uh sample the base, then

864
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,080
repeat this till you've essentially

865
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,240
generated the full sequence. Um

866
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,039
and you could choose which position to

867
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,240
unmask randomly or you could use the

868
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,440
model to guide your um position where

869
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,279
you unmask. You could look at the

870
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,200
confidence for example from the models

871
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,919
or the two minus entry to select the

872
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,760
next position that you choose to unmask.

873
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,359
So to demonstrate this more concretely

874
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,040
we turn to a more interesting case where

875
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,040
we have not just one track but we have

876
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,320
three tracks uh coming from three

877
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,359
distinct uh cell types. So GM1287 as

878
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,399
before but also dermal fibroblasts um

879
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:28,399
and H1 H embionic stem cells kind of

880
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:31,760
stem cell um population use a thousand

881
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,440
train on thousand base regions and again

882
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,679
with a uniform masking rate during

883
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,480
training and so once you've trained this

884
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,399
model we can then almost prompt it with

885
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,040
um profiles that of of of peaks across

886
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,960
cell types um that we would like the

887
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,720
generated sequence

888
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,399
um to have in in different cellular

889
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,560
context right so here we can prompt it

890
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,879
with a cell type specific regulatory

891
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,359
element so we can say I want high

892
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,440
activity in GM1287 that even looks a

893
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,160
specific way so it's somewhat narrow and

894
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,119
and uh at the center of this regulatory

895
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,000
element and maybe no activity in fiber

896
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,079
blast and H1C's and then what Nona will

897
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,680
do is generate not just one but you can

898
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,119
run you can keep running this multiple

899
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,640
times generate a bunch of sequence

900
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,760
candidates

901
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,760
um that hopefully have the desired

902
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,520
functional properties and then you can

903
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,200
pass each of these sequences through a

904
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,520
sequenceto function oracle model. In

905
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,839
this case just to keep things uh

906
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,720
independent we use a model like boroy

907
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:35,040
and boro also predicts the profile of

908
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,800
activity across the same cell types. So

909
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,440
in this case you can see that upon

910
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,480
specifying a sequence to have activity

911
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,119
specifically in GM12878 NA designs a

912
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,760
sequence which is also predicted to have

913
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,320
uh activity in GM12878. So it's kind of

914
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,240
fulfilling the design objective if you

915
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,400
may and we see more or less um this

916
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,000
across the sequences generated we see

917
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,480
that it's able to recover this kind of

918
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,720
cell type specific activity. There are

919
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,480
some hits but there are some misses but

920
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,920
on average you can see that the

921
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,920
generated sequences have GM12878

922
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,880
specific activity in this case and you

923
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,119
can repeat the same thing with

924
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,200
fiberblast or H1C's and it's able to

925
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,200
generate regulatory elements specific to

926
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,400
these cell types or you could prompt it

927
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,160
with something that's a bit more

928
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,640
ubiquitous. you let's say you want a

929
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,000
regulatory element that's shifted to the

930
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,079
right uh accessible in all cell types

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,560
and by and large it's able to do the

932
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,440
same uh it's able to design what you ask

933
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,000
for um you can also what we start trying

934
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,359
to do is prompt to more complex profile

935
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,200
specifications in this case you have uh

936
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,960
kind of a biodal distribution fiber

937
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,040
blasts and a left shifted one in GM12878

938
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,680
but the centers of the peaks aren't

939
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,160
really aligned between GM1287 5 plus and

940
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,560
no activity in ESC's and you can see at

941
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,920
least some examples though not all seem

942
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,400
to um recover the kind of expected

943
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,000
profile specifications. So this a

944
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,599
prototype of sorts but you can imagine

945
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,480
if you start throwing in other tracks

946
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,640
like gene expression or cage you can

947
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,680
think of designing entire regulatory

948
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,839
domains where you have um some desired

949
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,760
um chromatin accessibility across cell

950
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,400
types and potentially even gene

951
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,480
expression in different cell types.

952
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,839
Um and we also looked at motifs that are

953
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,520
typically enriched within these

954
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,079
sequences. So for example the fiber

955
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,880
blast specific sequences that Nona

956
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,119
generates um you would find more AP1

957
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,440
motifs in them which makes sense. AP1 is

958
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,240
a like the June force family of

959
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,119
transcription factors um are known to

960
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,720
have high activity in five blasts. You

961
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,800
see similar patterns across the board.

962
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,760
The ox motif um plays a crucial role in

963
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,079
in stem cells regulation in stem cells

964
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,760
and that seems to be enriched in um H1C

965
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,880
specific generated sequences.

966
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,240
So to wrap up this section um what we're

967
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,160
seeing with functional language modeling

968
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,040
is that we're able to learn meaningful

969
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,880
regulatory DNA features um and also

970
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,280
generate sequences with with desired

971
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,280
profile specs.

972
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,800
All right. So, I I'll start with the

973
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,960
last part which actually touches upon a

974
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,280
completely different aspect of of genome

975
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,880
privacy. Um, which which I was shocked

976
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,520
was something that we could even get

977
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,119
into with these kinds of models. Um, but

978
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,680
what I'm going to show you is is that we

979
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,400
can actually use an instantiation of

980
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,040
these function language models um to to

981
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,599
ddidentify attack files, fragment files

982
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,920
specifically. Let me show what I mean by

983
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,720
that. Um so if you worked with attack

984
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,560
data of any kind uh or or really any

985
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,720
sequencing data once you get your fast q

986
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,359
files from the sequencer you align them

987
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,280
to your reference genome um and you end

988
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,760
up with a bam file which contains

989
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,920
information about where each read aligns

990
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,599
to as well as information about any

991
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,280
potential mismatches to the reference

992
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,000
genome. So in this case you're seeing

993
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,839
that there's an attackseek peak here and

994
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,440
um all the reads from this specific

995
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,079
individual contain a mismatch at this

996
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,320
position which suggests that the uh

997
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,160
genotype of the individual here is is

998
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,000
not the same as the reference here. It's

999
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,760
it's this individual has um a variant at

1000
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,440
this site in this case a homozygous

1001
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,200
alternate variant. Um

1002
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,640
another way to represent a tax seek

1003
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,200
which has gained popularity with the

1004
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,079
advent of single cell attack especially

1005
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,320
is what we call a fragment file. These

1006
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,320
are just um three column you know tab

1007
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,760
separated files where instead of um

1008
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,560
supplying a lot of information about the

1009
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,079
reads you just specify the chromosome um

1010
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,119
and the start and the end coordinates.

1011
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,359
So for example for this specific read

1012
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,599
you just say it starts here and and it

1013
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,760
ends here and uh there's no information

1014
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,560
beyond that except just a list of

1015
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,359
alignment start and end coordinates for

1016
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,040
uh for each read right so in theory it's

1017
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,359
deidentified because any information

1018
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,720
that BAM files contained about mismatch

1019
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,640
mismatches indels or other complex um

1020
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,200
sequence mutations is not really

1021
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,079
captured or is not kept in these

1022
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,000
fragments um in principle

1023
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,560
Um and so the question we asked is if we

1024
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,800
can actually predict the genotype simply

1025
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,880
from a list of coordinates. Right? So at

1026
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,680
first it sounds like I'm not even making

1027
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,599
sense uh because this information is not

1028
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,200
there. But if you start digging into

1029
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,960
attack data more closely, you'll see

1030
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,280
there's actually something interesting

1031
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,440
going on. So when you look at attack as

1032
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,680
you might have over longer regions of

1033
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,200
DNA, you'll see regions with enrich

1034
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,640
which with enhanced signal. These are

1035
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,960
regulatory elements that we've been

1036
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,760
talking about all morning.

1037
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,760
But once you zoom into a specific

1038
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,839
regulatory element and look at say 100

1039
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,800
bases um around it um and when we just

1040
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,000
look at the start so we just make u look

1041
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,000
at the starts and ends of these

1042
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,240
coordinates and count how many starts or

1043
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,800
ends of any of these files of any of

1044
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,040
these reads we have at uh specific

1045
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,480
positions. What we'll see is that attack

1046
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,880
seek at base resolution is actually

1047
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,960
quite spiky. So what it means is that

1048
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,000
within this regulatory element of 100

1049
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,760
bases uh you're seeing more cuts at this

1050
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,680
specific position compared to the

1051
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,079
positions around it. So it's it's not a

1052
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,079
uniform way of cutting but it's almost

1053
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,480
like it's preferring certain bases for

1054
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,119
cut over others. And the reason behind

1055
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,359
this is that the TN5 transpos transpose

1056
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,440
enzyme that's used in attack has a

1057
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,440
sequence preference. What that means is

1058
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,480
it's more likely to cut at positions

1059
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,280
where there's a G4 basis um upstream and

1060
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,760
a C4 basis downstream. It's not a very

1061
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,960
hard preference, but it does end up

1062
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,480
reflecting um this kind of spikiness and

1063
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,920
it's it's manifested this kind of

1064
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,079
spikiness in attack profiles and and the

1065
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,000
recent preprint from my PhD adviser

1066
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,960
Anupra Pandaji's lab on Chrome BPE uh is

1067
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,400
something you should check out if you

1068
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,440
want a more detailed treatment of what

1069
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,160
this bias looks like. But the high level

1070
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,960
takeaway is that the DN5 enzyme has a

1071
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,839
sequence preference and if you alter the

1072
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,520
underlying DNA sequence with a mutation,

1073
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,760
it might alter the uh the pattern of of

1074
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,000
cuts. Right? So just to illustrate this

1075
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,800
in more detail uh what we did is we

1076
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,480
looked at attack seek from the AFGR

1077
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,359
project the African genome resource

1078
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,640
project subset of the thousand genomes

1079
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,760
um uh people and at this specific

1080
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,680
variant on chromosome one uh if you just

1081
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,760
add up the reads from 32 people that

1082
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,240
have a TT genotype at this specific

1083
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,800
position this is uh the pattern of reads

1084
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,640
you get um and then there are 15 people

1085
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,640
that have an AA genotype and here is the

1086
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,079
pattern of reads from those people. And

1087
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,440
both of these have been appropriately

1088
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,359
normalized. And you can compare the

1089
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,280
numbers in the light on the left and

1090
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,440
right panels. And so I'm going to pause

1091
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,359
for 10 seconds and make this a game of

1092
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,960
spot the difference. And I hope you can

1093
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,400
find some positions where there's

1094
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,480
differences between these plots. It's

1095
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,480
kind of subtle, but um take a squint, I

1096
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
guess.

1097
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,319
So hopefully you saw a few of these uh

1098
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,960
positions where there's differences

1099
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,880
caused just by by the variant. Right? So

1100
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,079
the one I my eyes went to immediately

1101
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,480
was this tall bar here is reduced um to

1102
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,640
some extent here. There's also changes

1103
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,000
at at these three positions. The shape

1104
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,920
changes from high low to high low high.

1105
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,319
Uh and even around the variant you see

1106
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,839
some local changes in in the cutting

1107
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,760
patterns. Right? So these aren't

1108
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,240
actually necessarily variants that

1109
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,079
affect chromatin accessibility entirely.

1110
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,079
Uh these are just affecting the local

1111
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,119
cutting patterns around the variant. So

1112
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,640
they don't necessarily have to sit

1113
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,240
within a transcription factor binding

1114
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,079
site to affect chromatin accessibility.

1115
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,640
They just can be really any variance

1116
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,359
within a highly accessible region.

1117
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,440
Right? And so I think it stands to

1118
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,200
reason that if I were to give you the

1119
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,520
profiles

1120
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,440
um of around around the variant of

1121
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,280
interest, if you squint at many of

1122
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,440
these, hopefully eventually you'll be

1123
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,760
able to predict the genotype from just

1124
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,160
the patterns uh just these sort of

1125
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,480
cutting patterns of attack and nothing

1126
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,599
else, right? And so to test that out, we

1127
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,599
trained a nona model, a very small 128

1128
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,760
baseline nona model with the same

1129
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,680
functional uh language model loss. So uh

1130
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,319
we have the functional tracks here which

1131
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,800
is attack seek from GM1 to878 at base

1132
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,160
resolution and then we're masking with a

1133
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,240
variable masking rate when we're

1134
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,599
training. And another important point to

1135
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,800
note is that we're actually just

1136
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,560
training still with the reference

1137
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,880
genome. So when we're training this

1138
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,200
model, we don't require access to any

1139
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,960
individual specific variants. Just the

1140
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,800
fact that

1141
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,880
most positions in the genome are not um

1142
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,040
are not don't differ across individuals

1143
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,280
is enough for the model to latch on to

1144
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,520
relevant features. And once you're done

1145
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,040
training, we can go from snip to snip

1146
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,200
especially in regions with high

1147
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,040
chromatin accessibility

1148
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,680
and try to predict the genotype from the

1149
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,599
surrounding DNA sequence um and the

1150
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,000
attack seek base resolution signal.

1151
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,680
Right? So once you train this model, I'm

1152
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,359
going to see if it can actually do

1153
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,200
exactly this, right? Can it predict the

1154
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,599
individual variance? And the most

1155
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,000
interesting positions for one specific

1156
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,240
individual would be where the individual

1157
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,480
has a variant that differs from the

1158
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,319
reference, right? So in this case, we're

1159
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,000
we're going after homozygous alternate

1160
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,079
variants where the reference, for

1161
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,480
example, says there should be a G here.

1162
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,359
Um, but the the specific individual has

1163
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,119
two copies of NA, for example. Um, and

1164
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,440
these could also be in the training set

1165
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,960
and the model is almost trained with the

1166
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,720
wrong label with a G here. Or they could

1167
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,960
be in the test set where it's not seen

1168
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,800
them before. And so we asked, you know,

1169
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,200
in how many of such cases can the model

1170
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,119
correctly genotype this individual just

1171
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,280
from the attack C cutting patterns? And

1172
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,680
it turns out at least in regions with

1173
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,680
high chromatin accessibility in the top

1174
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,480
thousand strongest peaks, it's almost as

1175
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,839
high as 90% for for homozygous alternate

1176
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,760
variants. So we can't really distinguish

1177
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,599
between hetererozygous versus homozygous

1178
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,760
at this point. But you subset the

1179
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,960
analysis to homozygous alternate

1180
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,359
variance. You can see you can actually

1181
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,040
very accurately predict the individual's

1182
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,040
variance just from the cutting patterns

1183
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,880
of a taxi which were derived from a

1184
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,680
fragment file which in theory didn't

1185
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,000
contain any personal identifying variant

1186
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,200
level information.

1187
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,200
So um go a step ahead and let's say we

1188
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,119
had access to a database of individuals

1189
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,800
and their genotypes. Let's say there's a

1190
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,560
malicious actor that's uh that's

1191
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,880
collected this and then we get the

1192
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,480
attack C fragment file from Bob. We can

1193
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,880
go from variant to variant and make

1194
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,640
predictions at each position. And let's

1195
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,760
say at this specific position we have a

1196
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,800
prediction of 7 for C. We see indeed Bob

1197
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,040
has you know two copies of C here. Um

1198
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,760
would it be possible to link this attack

1199
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,880
sample from Bob uh to Bob's genotype?

1200
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,520
That's the question we ask. Um and so we

1201
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,280
can come up with simple scores that

1202
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,800
match the similarity between each of

1203
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,480
these genotypes and the predicted

1204
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,560
probabilities or the predicted genotypes

1205
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,560
from a taxi. You could simply look at

1206
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,119
the likelihood of observing this

1207
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,280
genotype under this model separately for

1208
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,920
each of these people and then rank

1209
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,839
individuals that have the highest math

1210
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,400
score. Right?

1211
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,960
So we did this uh what we did then was

1212
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,040
we looked at 3,200 genomes from the

1213
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,119
thousand genomes project and then for

1214
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,720
this one specific individual named

1215
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,119
NA12878

1216
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,880
from their attack seek um track we

1217
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,040
predicted their genotype and then we

1218
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,520
tried to match it against these 300

1219
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,720
3,200 individuals. This is a histogram

1220
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:42,160
of scores you get. Um, these are math

1221
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:45,200
scores of attack from from NA1 to878

1222
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,200
with 3,200 genotypes. And it turns out

1223
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,760
the the math score of the attack seek

1224
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,640
from NA1 to878 the genotype with of one

1225
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,319
NA1 to878 is is really high and it's

1226
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,400
like a strong outlier and these are the

1227
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,599
other individuals in the data set. And

1228
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,520
what this is really suggesting, it's

1229
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,920
super easy to identify that the sample

1230
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,040
came from NA12878

1231
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,520
and not the other 3,200 individuals. And

1232
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,480
so we repeated this analysis for attack

1233
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,800
samples from 83 individuals in the AFGR

1234
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,960
project and tried to link them against

1235
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,960
the 3,200 or so genomes um in the

1236
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,960
thousand genomes database. And turns out

1237
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,720
we can link each sample perfectly.

1238
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,680
Right? We call this a success if you're

1239
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,920
able to rank if you're able to rank the

1240
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,960
person from whom the attack sample came

1241
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,359
as the top uh match for our attack

1242
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,240
samples. And so we're able to do this

1243
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:40,400
with almost perfect accuracy for for all

1244
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,240
of these 83 individuals. But if you

1245
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,040
start subsampling the attack seek within

1246
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,400
each of these uh from the samples of

1247
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,880
each of these individuals, so you're

1248
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,880
basically reducing your signal. uh there

1249
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,240
is a point of about 5 million reads

1250
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,160
below which we start losing our

1251
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,200
accuracy. Or maybe another way to look

1252
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,119
at it is even if you have 500 cells from

1253
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,359
some individual and you have a fragment

1254
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,280
file corresponding to that, it's enough

1255
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,319
for us to be able to genotype them in

1256
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,640
this specific situation.

1257
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:12,800
Um

1258
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,720
yeah, so so to conclude this part um

1259
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,440
show a nona model that's able to sort of

1260
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,760
didentify attack fragment files. And

1261
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,599
today if you go on Jio and you look up

1262
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,559
data set releases from different papers

1263
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,119
you will find papers where um fast cues

1264
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,040
and other sensitive files have been have

1265
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,119
been sent to dbgap for access control

1266
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,000
but you can find fragment files from a

1267
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,520
tag seek uh publicly available. So that

1268
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
does seem to highlight um potential

1269
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,000
privacy risk.

1270
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,520
So these are just three applications I

1271
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,200
covered but as I mentioned this is a

1272
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,240
very flexible framework. you can come up

1273
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,760
with the mask of your choice and attach

1274
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,359
that to the task of your choice and

1275
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,640
hopefully do something really

1276
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:58,079
interesting. Um, and you're potentially

1277
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,880
just scratching the surface of what's

1278
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,559
possible with this. Um, so Nona is a

1279
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,359
mass modeling based framework for

1280
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,119
function genomics and unifies common use

1281
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,520
cases like sequence to function and

1282
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,839
genomic language modeling. Um, but also

1283
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,480
is seems to be able to open up entirely

1284
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,000
novel applications. Um, and what's

1285
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,160
really nice is we can flexibly and

1286
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,400
dynamically change inputs and outputs

1287
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,599
across modalities which in this case are

1288
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,040
DNA sequence and and functional tracks.

1289
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,520
And this is a question that was asked

1290
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,280
and in theory we can support multiple

1291
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,960
masking modes in the same model. And

1292
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,760
this does seem to work to some extent,

1293
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,160
but um it's it's still a pretty

1294
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,160
interesting direction.
