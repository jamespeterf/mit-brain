1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,439
good morning good morning afternoon I

2
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,960
guess technically uh welcome to lecture

3
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:23,359
15 of 61200 6120 again I still don't

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,720
know how to call it um today we are

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,199
talking about relations and

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,960
Counting um and there's a bunch of scary

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,079
stuff on the board ignore that

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,120
wonderful so first thing we're talking

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,200
about is

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,079
relations uh and relations are a very

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,399
useful tool U very useful term

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:47,360
generalizing the idea of a function um

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,760
so let's see what we mean by that um

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,719
let's see

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,719
so yes so a

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,359
relation R is a subset of A cross B A

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,159
and B are sets they can be any sets you

18
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,200
want R is going to be a subset of pairs

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,720
um where the first element is taken from

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,360
a the second element is taken from B it

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,240
might be all the pairs none of the pairs

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,560
some subset of the pairs um all we know

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,280
is that we need all three of these

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
pieces of data uh a relation

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,840
consists of first of all a

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
domain a which is any set

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,920
a

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,720
co-domain b which is a

29
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,439
set and a

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,399
subset are subset of A cross

31
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,320
B so you need to know what is your

32
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,159
domain what is your co-domain and which

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,920
pairs are part of your

34
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,280
relation um this generalizes the idea of

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,759
a function because you can think of a

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,920
function as you have your inputs you

37
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,959
have your outputs and your function

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,560
specifies which inputs map to which

39
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,680
outputs by just encoding them in a pair

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,680
like this um Let me give a more concrete

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,519
example here we go so imagine we have

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,519
these three sets we have the set of

43
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,640
students that are Luke geralt Quinton

44
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,280
and Willow um and we have some classes

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
that these magic students might take in

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,400
a magic school I guess uh chemistry

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,800
Sports literature and

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,080
61200 totally makes sense um and we have

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
some magic profs we have gadriel Zelda

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,760
Zelda Ada and Doctor

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,440
Strange um so we have some sets we might

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,760
specify a relation uh let's call it the

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,560
learning relation L which is going to be

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,280
a subset of students cross classes so

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,440
it's going to be all pairs where you

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,120
have a student who's taking a class and

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,599
in this case it looks like we have these

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,000
students taking these classes it looks

59
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,680
like Luke is taking chemistry Luke is

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,599
also taking literature Galt is taking

61
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,319
chemistry and sports and literature Etc

62
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,799
so we need all three of these pieces of

63
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,959
information the domain the co-domain and

64
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,640
the set of pairs in order to specify

65
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,799
this

66
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,239
relation likewise here's another

67
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,920
relation which classes are being taught

68
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,439
by which professors so this is a subset

69
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,159
of classes times professors

70
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,799
and it's saying that um this class

71
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,200
chemistry is being taught by this

72
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,120
professor Ada Sports is being taught by

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,560
strange lit by gadriel and 61200 is

74
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,959
being taught by Zach I mean

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,439
Zelda thank you

76
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,920
um this might look pretty familiar this

77
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:56,200
is almost how we Define directed graphs

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,439
right um You have some some set of

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,599
vertices or whatnot uh and you have some

80
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,439
edges between them this is very closely

81
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,280
related concept um and just like with

82
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,439
graphs

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,000
um that representation isn't the most

84
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,640
useful way to represent it it's kind of

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,840
hard to see who's taking what and

86
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,199
visualize and and think about it so

87
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,840
let's draw it instead so we already said

88
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,800
uh here we have the learning relation

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,360
ill uh we said Luc is taking chemistry

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,919
and I'm going to draw it with a directed

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,960
Arrow um Luke is also taking literature

92
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,759
geralt is taking

93
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,800
chemistry uh and sports geralt is taking

94
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,440
also

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,800
literature then Quinton is taking Sports

96
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,280
and lit Quinton is taking Sports and lit

97
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,360
uh and Willow is taking lit and

98
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,680
apparently no one is taking 61200 at

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,919
this magic school uh shame for them but

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,800
this is a very clear representation in

101
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,240
my mind but again it's representing the

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,400
same information and we can see that in

103
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,960
fact this is

104
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:09,240
exactly a directed graph where the

105
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,360
vertices are um what is it students

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,479
union classes those are our allowed

107
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
vertices and it just has the special

108
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,319
form where each one of our directed

109
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,039
arrows always goes from a student to a

110
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,440
class but otherwise it's just a directed

111
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,199
graph does that make sense let's quickly

112
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,240
draw the other one um so we have

113
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,520
chemistry being taught by Ada we have

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,240
sports being taught by

115
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,639
strange lit by

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,560
gadriel and 61200 by Zelda so this is

117
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,759
the um the teaching

118
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,400
relation are we clear on what these

119
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,720
examples

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,520
are um

121
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,080
wonderful

122
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,479
so for notation there are lots of

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,240
different notations that are used for

124
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,800
relations because relations are used in

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,360
lots of different ways um but here are

126
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
some common

127
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,960
notations so if R is a

128
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:16,560
relation from A to B uh then we might

129
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:20,039
write um a relates to

130
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,560
B to mean that the pair a comma

131
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,080
B is one of the pairs in our relation

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,240
one of the directed edges in our

133
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,160
graph um because like I said the

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,479
relation is really about specifying

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,520
which pair pairs relate and which pairs

136
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,639
don't it's a yes no question some of the

137
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,000
pairs are yes some of the pairs are no

138
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,800
and so we might write a relates to B

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,199
with this infix notation to say that a

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,319
relates to B um we're saying the same

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,080
thing just with different notation um

142
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:52,000
and this might remind you of things like

143
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,479
three um like three is less than seven a

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,120
sub um a set s is a subset of a set T

145
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,199
this less than relation this subset

146
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,120
equal relation these are relations and

147
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,240
this General notion of relation is a way

148
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,160
to generalize Concepts like this and so

149
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,840
this is why we sometimes have our infix

150
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,599
notation like that so we can think about

151
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,560
whatever other relation we're talking

152
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,960
about similar to how we think about

153
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,680
these more familiar

154
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,879
ones all

155
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,759
right um we

156
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:27,840
also we can also think of r as a

157
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:30,560
predicate we can say R of a comma

158
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,599
B so if R is a predicate that takes two

159
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
arguments and say and spits out true or

160
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,080
false this is another way you can think

161
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,080
of specifying a subset of

162
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:47,319
pairs so R AB is true when AB is part of

163
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,319
our relation and it's false when it's

164
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:57,199
not and phrase wise we might say that

165
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,759
a

166
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,520
relates to B

167
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:07,800
again means the same

168
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,840
thing means that a B is in

169
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,720
r at its core we we are just trying to

170
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,039
give one bit of information for each

171
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,080
pair either this pair relates or this

172
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,840
pair doesn't this pair is in our set or

173
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,720
it's not this pair satisfies our

174
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,720
predicate or it doesn't all different

175
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,639
ways of saying the same

176
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,159
thing does that make sense wonderful uh

177
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,960
and by the way when we say relation here

178
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,240
uh specifically we're talking about

179
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,200
binary

180
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,760
relation um yeah that should say a

181
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,760
binary

182
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,599
relation but all the relations we're

183
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,720
going to talk about today are binary but

184
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,760
it's the same relation as in relational

185
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,680
database um you can imagine that this

186
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
kind of thing is exactly how a database

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
stores its information in this case

188
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,800
we're only talking about databases with

189
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,399
two

190
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,760
columns um so learning has a column for

191
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,120
a student and a column for class and

192
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,519
there's a row every time a student's

193
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,519
taking a class that's all this is It's a

194
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:18,079
database excuse me um

195
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,240
yes so I said

196
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,079
earlier that here let's go back up

197
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,399
here that relations are a generalization

198
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,600
of functions and let's see what we mean

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,600
by that

200
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,640
so

201
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,880
definition a relation R from A to

202
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,040
B is a

203
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,920
function uh precisely

204
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,920
when

205
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,920
every element on the left

206
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,720
side relates to at most

207
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,040
one

208
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,959
element on the right side so if every

209
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,720
everything in the left set appears on

210
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,240
the left side of at most one pair it's

211
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
the source of at most one Arrow so

212
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,279
another way to say that

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,800
is

214
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,760
um every a in

215
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,200
a has at most

216
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,200
one Arrow

217
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:35,279
out all right so these two examples is

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,279
this learning relation a

219
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,120
function who can tell me

220
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,200
why yeah we have a student with multiple

221
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,360
arrows going out that's precisely what

222
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,720
we need to avoid it's function says each

223
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,279
each node on the left is supposed to

224
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,680
have at most one Arrow going out uh and

225
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:00,839
this fails that is this a

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,839
function yeah um every class has at most

227
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,959
one Arrow out so it's a function if I

228
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,360
deleted this

229
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,240
Arrow so now we only have these three

230
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,720
arrows and no one's teaching 61200 is

231
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,519
this still a

232
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,079
function yeah it's fine at most one

233
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,600
Arrow not exactly one Arrow so that's

234
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,760
still fine even if that arrow is missing

235
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,760
but I'm going to put it back because

236
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,600
that's our

237
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,560
example uh let's

238
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,839
see when R is a

239
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:39,040
function uh we'll write R of

240
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,040
a equals B to

241
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,600
mean means that a B is in the relation

242
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:49,959
and so R of a is the element that a

243
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,160
points to if it exists R A might be

244
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,399
undefined uh if the function doesn't

245
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,040
have any Arrow out at this point but if

246
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,000
there's only one we we can just call it

247
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,240
R of a this is the usual function

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,240
notation that we're used to

249
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,519
uh let's make that even more

250
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,800
precise uh let's look at the function

251
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,440
f um from

252
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,920
R to R by the way when it's a function

253
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,440
we can use this more specific notation

254
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,160
um f is a function from R to R we use

255
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,839
the arrow instead of f as a subset of R

256
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,040
cross R um

257
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,320
so let's define the function where f

258
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,839
ofx is 1x^2

259
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,519
the kind of function you might see in a

260
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,199
pre-calculus class or

261
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,800
something um everyone agrees this is a

262
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,920
function well I mean kind of how is it a

263
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,560
function by our definition of

264
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,959
relation um we're supposed to specify a

265
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,880
domain check a co-domain check and a set

266
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:00,240
of pairs so what are the set of pairs in

267
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,760
this case uh the set of pairs

268
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:09,199
is going to be X comma

269
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:11,720
Y in R cross R such that yal 1x^2

270
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,440
is just the set of pairs that satisfy

271
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,959
our

272
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,880
relation um another way to write this x

273
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:23,519
comma 1 /x^2

274
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,000
where X is a real

275
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,839
number without zero cuz we're not

276
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,120
allowed to divide by

277
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,560
zero all right all right so f is a

278
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,199
function here's a way to write it in

279
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,199
terms of the pairs like we've said

280
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,560
um and it's totally fine that F of zero

281
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,399
isn't defined because again you can't

282
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,959
divide by zero f says each input has at

283
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,399
most one output and it just happens that

284
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,839
the input zero has no outputs which is

285
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,320
fine sometimes you do want everything to

286
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,160
have every input to have an

287
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:00,199
output uh so we have a different term

288
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,199
for that we'll say that a relation

289
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
is

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,920
total if and only

291
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,519
if every a in

292
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,560
a

293
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,560
has at least one Arrow

294
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,279
out in other words every a for every a

295
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,519
on the left side there's at least one B

296
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,279
on the right side that it relates to

297
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,839
everything on the left has some Arrow

298
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,839
going out possibly multiple that's what

299
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,160
we call

300
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,360
Total

301
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,839
um are our examples here

302
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,839
total is this one

303
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,519
total yeah everything on the left has at

304
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,399
one Arrow out has at least one Arrow out

305
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,920
here everything on the left has at least

306
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,920
one Arrow out

307
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,920
excellent is this function total

308
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,920
no why

309
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,040
not zero has no Arrow out F of zero

310
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,959
doesn't exist there is nothing that zero

311
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,480
relates to on the right okay let's give

312
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,320
a a different

313
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:26,120
example uh let's define

314
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:30,880
G from the set of R without

315
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:32,399
zero to the set of R without Z

316
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,399
this is supposed to be a

317
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,160
set where we're going to Def find G of X

318
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,160
is 1x^2

319
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,120
all right same function

320
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:50,160
right same set of

321
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,160
pairs is this function G

322
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,199
total I saw exactly two nods and a bunch

323
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,720
of blank stairs

324
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,800
that is all

325
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,360
right um someone who's oh a couple more

326
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,959
nods U someone who's nodding can you

327
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,959
tell me why G is

328
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,959
total

329
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,600
yes great uh so so they were saying uh

330
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,600
since zero is no longer an option as an

331
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,720
input um all of the inputs that we're

332
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,040
allowed to choose do have a valid output

333
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,040
assigned to them so this function G is

334
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,040
total this function f is not

335
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:47,680
total even though it's exactly the same

336
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,279
set of pairs for both f and g it's

337
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,920
exactly the same set of real comma real

338
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,880
or X comma 1/x^2 for all the non-zero

339
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,160
values of X all we've done is change the

340
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,319
domain and

341
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,319
co-domain uh and this goes to show that

342
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,480
you need all three parts of that

343
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:05,319
definition of relation you need to know

344
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,319
what set you're mapping from what set

345
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,319
you're mapping to and what all of your

346
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,480
related pairs are all three of those

347
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,120
pieces of

348
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,919
information are important to determine

349
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,120
things like whether it's a function

350
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,720
whether it's total does that make

351
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,039
sense

352
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,039
awesome uh now

353
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,880
there's oh by the way uh oh also these

354
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,640
often go together uh so

355
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,720
a

356
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,440
total

357
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,919
function means it has uh so total means

358
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,280
everything on the left has at least one

359
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,240
Arrow out function means everything on

360
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,520
the left has at most one Arrow out so if

361
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,240
you put those together total

362
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:55,880
function um has

363
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,880
exactly one Arrow out

364
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,880
uh for each a and

365
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,480
a and secretly when mathematicians say

366
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,679
function they usually mean total

367
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,400
function usually the fact that some

368
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,120
values some inputs don't have outputs

369
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,840
that's supposed to be sort of a special

370
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,520
case uh and the default when we say

371
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,120
function is that everything on the left

372
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,120
has a a definite output on the right so

373
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,919
when mathematicians say function we

374
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,000
usually mean total function

375
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,039
um when we're not assuming that a

376
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,360
function is total mathematicians will

377
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,360
often say partial

378
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,240
function so partial function means a

379
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,880
function that isn't necessarily total it

380
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,840
might be total confusingly a total

381
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,840
function is an example of a partial

382
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,080
function partial does not mean not total

383
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,760
partial does not mean that it's

384
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,159
definitely missing inputs partial just

385
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,760
means that you're not

386
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,480
assuming there aren't missing

387
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,120
inputs so by our by our definitions that

388
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,360
we've set out today partial function

389
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,559
just means

390
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,240
function and total function means

391
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
function that has nothing missing no

392
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,919
inputs

393
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,480
missing um from now on in this class uh

394
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,360
whenever we use the word function we're

395
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,120
going to try to specify whether we mean

396
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,159
a total function or whether we're

397
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,400
allowed to have some missing inputs

398
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,159
because usually when we say function uh

399
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,880
we're going to mean total function and

400
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,000
so let's decide from now on in this

401
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,679
class at least when we give um problem

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,120
statements to you that the word function

403
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,400
on its own is hereby

404
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,000
ambiguous whenever we say function we

405
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,679
should really be telling you do we mean

406
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,159
total function or do we mean function

407
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,200
that may or may not be

408
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,840
total

409
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,600
um so if you see it on a problem set or

410
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,200
test and it's not qualified like that

411
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,400
please ask we want to clarify that for

412
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,400
you we're not we're not trying to be

413
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,880
tricky with edge cases of this

414
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,320
definition if you see function on its

415
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,320
own without qualifiers please ask yes

416
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:37,799
uh so a relation is total if everything

417
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,440
on the left has at least one Arrow out a

418
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,440
relation is a total

419
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,280
function um if it's total and also a

420
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,400
function which means that everything on

421
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,320
the left has exactly one Arrow out great

422
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,480
question

423
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,480
um all

424
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,640
right yeah sorry that partial function

425
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,840
does not mean function that isn't total

426
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,480
even though that's what it sounds like

427
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,720
it should be partial function just means

428
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,600
function that may or may not be total

429
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,960
naming things is

430
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,880
hard um or rather using bad names that

431
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,840
someone else has already defined for us

432
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,039
is hard I would change it if I

433
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:25,039
could anyway

434
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,320
um great um we have similar not similar

435
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,400
terminology for arrows in instead of

436
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,919
arrows out so so far we've looked at

437
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,640
total and function which are talking

438
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,640
about how many arrows are coming out of

439
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,200
the left side um we can also ask how

440
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,960
many arrows are coming into the right

441
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,960
side so we'll say that R which is a

442
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,960
relation between A and B is

443
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,880
injective if and only

444
00:21:51,360 --> 00:22:00,159
if every element on the right

445
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,559
side uh has at most one

446
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,200
arrow

447
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,200
in and we'll call it

448
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:18,480
surjective if and only if every B and

449
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,320
B has at least

450
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,039
one arrow

451
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:28,120
in so injective means you never hit the

452
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,720
same thing twice surjective means you

453
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,320
hit every everything possibly more than

454
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,840
once back to these

455
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,840
examples is L

456
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,039
injective in other words does everything

457
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:50,120
on the right side have at most one arrow

458
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:54,200
in no thumbs down thank you um for

459
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,679
example chemistry has multiple arrows in

460
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,559
that alone is enough to show that it's

461
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,840
not injective is it surjective

462
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:06,039
also no another thumbs down thank you um

463
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,400
it's not surjective because 61200

464
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,559
doesn't have any arrows in surjective

465
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,360
means you're supposed to hit everything

466
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,440
on the right and we don't so this is

467
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,480
neither surjective nor injective whereas

468
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,440
this is

469
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,919
both everything on the right has at

470
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,600
least one arrow in so it's surjective

471
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,760
and at most one arrow in so it's

472
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,760
injective all right

473
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,120
now one of the reasons we're defining

474
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,400
all of these similar confusing sounding

475
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,880
terms apologies for that um is that we

476
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,360
have some theorems that help that these

477
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,679
terms are enough to help us relate the

478
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,960
sizes of various sets so we have our

479
00:23:51,679 --> 00:24:00,440
first theorem of the day um if a and b

480
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,440
are finite sets

481
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:09,880
and our a relation from A to B is a

482
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,880
total inject in total

483
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,520
injection so if we have finite sets and

484
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,520
a total injection from the first to the

485
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,520
second

486
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,000
then the size of a is at most the size

487
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,799
of B

488
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,840
if we can find a total injection from

489
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,399
one set to another set then the set on

490
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,520
the left is smaller or at most the same

491
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:39,840
size and let's let's draw a picture to

492
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
see

493
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,559
why um so total injection means that

494
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,240
everything on the left has at least one

495
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,799
Arrow out total means that and injection

496
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,240
means we never hit the same thing on the

497
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,240
right side

498
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:00,200
twice so there's always an arrow out on

499
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,159
the left side and there's at most one

500
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,640
Arrow out on the right side and so all

501
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:08,120
this is saying is that the number of

502
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,240
elements on the left is at most the

503
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,960
number of arrows because everything on

504
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,520
the left has at least one Arrow out and

505
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,120
the number of elements on the right side

506
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,640
is at least the number of arrows because

507
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,720
everything on the right has at most one

508
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,760
Arrow out so that's why this is true

509
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,399
size of a is less equal to the number of

510
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,320
arrows Which is less equal to the size

511
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,559
of

512
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,679
B so often when you want to show that

513
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:33,360
one set is smaller than another set you

514
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,640
just Define a total injection between

515
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,480
them and that's your proof

516
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,960
similarly on the other side of

517
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,159
things uh theorem

518
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:50,279
two let's

519
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,279
see if again A and B are finite

520
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,039
sets and

521
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,240
R is a surjective function

522
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,640
oops then the size of a is greater or

523
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:14,720
equal to the size of

524
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,039
B and I claim that's just exactly this

525
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,960
picture but in the opposite

526
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,520
direction um instead of total meaning

527
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,720
everything on the left has an arrow out

528
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,399
we have surjective which means

529
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,760
everything on the right has an arrow in

530
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,720
and instead of

531
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,520
injection which means everything on the

532
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,840
right has at most one out sorry at most

533
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,520
one in we have function which is

534
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,159
everything on the left has at most one

535
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,159
Arrow out so we've just swapped the

536
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,080
roles of in and out that's really all

537
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:48,640
that happened to translate this theorem

538
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:53,919
to that

539
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:57,919
theorem all right and by our powers

540
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,919
combined definition

541
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,159
if R

542
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,559
oops

543
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,440
is

544
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,760
injective

545
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:15,200
surjective total and a

546
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:19,320
function if it has all four of these

547
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,320
properties then we say that R is a

548
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,760
bje so that's the definition of bje bje

549
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,039
means you have all four of these nice

550
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,240
properties to summarize everything on

551
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,960
the left has exactly one Arrow out

552
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,000
everything on the right has exactly one

553
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,880
arrow

554
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,320
in and

555
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:47,200
Theorem um if R

556
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,200
oops from A to B is a

557
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,000
bje then the size of a equals the size

558
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,440
of

559
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,720
B all we're doing is applying both of

560
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,360
these theorems and we get both

561
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,120
inequalities so the sets have the same

562
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,559
size

563
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,039
all right so baction is the main tool

564
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,640
that we're going to be using in the

565
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:10,480
second half of this lecture um to

566
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,799
compare the sizes of sets questions

567
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,799
about

568
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,440
that

569
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,640
wonderful so next I want to talk about a

570
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,519
a couple special kinds of relations so

571
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,080
first of all um I never said that the

572
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:33,240
sets A and B have to be disjoint or even

573
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,240
distinct uh so let's look at the special

574
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,679
case where a equals

575
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:47,519
B so R is a subset of a cross

576
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,519
a we call this a binary relation on

577
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,679
a and this I claim is basically exactly

578
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,360
how we Define directed graph

579
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,760
you have a set of nodes which in this

580
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,559
case is a and serves as both our domain

581
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,960
and co-domain and you have a set of

582
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,960
directed

583
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,320
edges between

584
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,320
them and that's it that's that's how we

585
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,039
Define directed graph so a relation on a

586
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,279
is basically identical to a directed

587
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,679
graph whose vertices are a uh which

588
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:27,519
means that all of the directed graph

589
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,360
examples we've already talked about um

590
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,760
like who follows whom on Twitter like

591
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,200
reachability in Google Maps um all of

592
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,799
those diagraphs are also

593
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,000
relations uh there are relations on the

594
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:43,039
set of uh Twitter users or locations in

595
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,559
Google

596
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:50,640
Maps um another good example that I

597
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:53,440
really like uh of a relation on a set is

598
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,039
the relation of who likes whom not like

599
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,559
romantically or anything just you know

600
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,600
as a person who likes whom fix a moment

601
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,120
in time

602
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,919
everyone measures who they like among

603
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,360
all the other people in the world bam

604
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,080
you have your relation uh and the reason

605
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,159
I like it is that it has tons and tons

606
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,600
of chaotic

607
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,320
structure um for example uh if I like

608
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,360
you that doesn't mean that you like me

609
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,679
back necessarily especially this week

610
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,360
when the problem set's a bit long

611
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,120
apologies um if I like you and you like

612
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,440
them that doesn't mean that I like

613
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,919
them not always right that first example

614
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,840
I like you means you like me that's what

615
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,360
we're going to call symmetry in a little

616
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,960
bit U that second example if I like you

617
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,760
you like them that means I like them we

618
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,799
call that

619
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,760
transitivity so this graph is neither

620
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,399
symmetric nor transitive it's also not

621
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
reflexive um there there days when I

622
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,159
don't like myself so I wouldn't have a

623
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,200
self Loop in this

624
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,480
graph now I don't mean that in like a

625
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,679
cry for help kind of way but you know

626
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,679
you know some days you're a little down

627
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,159
on yourself it can happen it's okay if

628
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,720
it happens too much you have support ple

629
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,440
please seek it

630
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,919
out um

631
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,480
so funny story I I gave the same example

632
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,039
a couple years ago I got the same you

633
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,519
know half-hearted chuckle that we got

634
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,679
just now and then someone went home and

635
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,720
wrote about it on MIT

636
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,600
confessions I don't remember exactly

637
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,799
what they said but they maybe left off

638
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,559
some of the

639
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,360
context

640
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,679
um and then for the next couple days I

641
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,320
was getting multiple Facebook messages

642
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,600
from multiple friends Zack are you

643
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,720
okay uh I know we haven't caught up in a

644
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,679
while but I I'm here to a chat and I'd

645
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,279
love to to talk to you if if you're

646
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,960
available I hope you're doing well uh

647
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,960
and I just want to say I I I felt

648
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,320
loved so so thank you to whoever did

649
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,840
that but maybe let's not have a

650
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,279
repeat anyway back to

651
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,679
graphs um so one of the main reasons we

652
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,919
want to look at relations on a set uh is

653
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,600
because we already have lots of examples

654
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,600
and especially lots of examples that we

655
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,080
don't necessarily think of

656
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,799
as

657
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,799
graphs for

658
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:09,519
example a equals B is a relation that we

659
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,639
use all the time um a is congruent to B

660
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,679
mod 10 is a relation on the set of

661
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:17,000
natural numbers of integers that we use

662
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,519
all the time and don't necessarily think

663
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,519
of as a graph but it's it's definitely a

664
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
relation it's also a graph because

665
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,399
that's secretly the same thing but the

666
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,000
way you think about it can change if you

667
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,720
want to um likewise a less equ B we have

668
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
set a is a

669
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,559
subset of set B we have a divides B lots

670
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,679
of examples of

671
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,960
relations um that we want to be able to

672
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,440
talk

673
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:49,279
about um another good example is um

674
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,279
reachability so if G is a

675
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:00,639
diaph and if V and W are nodes of our

676
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,639
graph um then we can Define the walk

677
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:09,440
relation um yeah sorry that was out of

678
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,440
order if G is a diagraph we can Define

679
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,320
the walk relation on the set of vertices

680
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,399
of our

681
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,399
graph where we Define that

682
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,559
V relates to W under this walk relation

683
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,159
that we're going to call G prime or

684
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:29,760
sorry G

685
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,760
Star um if and only if there exists

686
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:37,080
walk from V to

687
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:40,679
W that's a relation we can Define on a

688
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,600
diaph and it's a really useful

689
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,120
one

690
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,960
um uh one thing I want to warn you about

691
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,440
we started with a graph we defined a

692
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,919
relation

693
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,600
gar we know that that relations on this

694
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,399
set of vertices can be thought of as a

695
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,679
graph on that set of vertices we're not

696
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:03,320
NE necessarily talking about the same

697
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,799
graph right this relation G star is

698
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,159
something we constructed from this diaph

699
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,000
G but the graph we constructed isn't

700
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,440
necessarily the same as the graph G that

701
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,599
we started with so it can be a little

702
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,760
confusing thinking of oh that's a graph

703
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,639
and that's also a graph that was

704
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,320
constructed from this

705
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,320
other it's fun to think about um but

706
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,839
just a warning even though we're talking

707
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,000
about two different graphs on the same

708
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:29,440
set of vertices they might actually be

709
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,720
two different

710
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,240
graphs um cool so there are two special

711
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,079
kinds of relations on a set that are

712
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,879
especially useful because we have lots

713
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,480
of examples and it's useful to be able

714
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,440
to generalize those examples um the

715
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,440
first one I want to talk

716
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,440
about is called an equivalence

717
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,119
relation and some of the examples I I

718
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,680
wrote down uh for

719
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,599
example a equal b or a is congruent to B

720
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,400
mod

721
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:09,000
10 these are somehow capturing this idea

722
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:12,000
of sameness A and B are the same A and B

723
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,760
have the same remainder mod 10 um if

724
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,240
we're talking about connectivity in a in

725
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,760
an undirected graph we say that two

726
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,480
nodes are connected with each other

727
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,240
meaning there's a walk from one to the

728
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,320
other which means that they belong to

729
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,480
the same connected component there's

730
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,880
another idea of sameness

731
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,280
there um so an equivalence relation is

732
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,200
this is an idea that generalizes this

733
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,760
idea of

734
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,359
sameness uh and so let's see if we can

735
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,560
do that what does it mean to somehow

736
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:46,599
encapsulate that the two things are

737
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,000
somehow equivalent to each other even if

738
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,680
they're not

739
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,280
identical um and it turns out there

740
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:58,319
there are three easy um by easy I mean

741
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,240
possibly confusing but I apologize um

742
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,480
three easily stated um properties that a

743
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,359
relation might have and if it has all

744
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,079
three then I claim it captures

745
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,480
everything it needs to capture about

746
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,480
this idea of sameness everything I've

747
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,640
just said is extremely vague

748
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,160
um let's make it

749
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,680
precise

750
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,560
so let's say that R is a relation on

751
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,280
a uh we're going to

752
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,280
say R is reflexive

753
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,760
uh this means

754
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,079
that um for all a and

755
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,960
a a relates to

756
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,960
itself reflexive means everything

757
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,960
relates to itself everything should be

758
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,280
the same as itself if sameness means

759
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,680
anything so this is definitely something

760
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,400
we would want to

761
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,880
have in terms of a diaph it means that

762
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,920
every vertex has a self Loop

763
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,880
all

764
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,880
right next one R is um

765
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,560
symmetric if and only if uh for all A

766
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,560
and B in our

767
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:23,560
set um a relates to B if and only if B

768
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,119
relates to

769
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,400
a so symmetry is saying that order

770
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,040
doesn't matter if if I'm your friend

771
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,960
then you're my

772
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,040
friend so Facebook not

773
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,839
Twitter um cool in terms of diagraph

774
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,079
remember a relation is always a diagraph

775
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,000
um this means that every time we have an

776
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,800
edge in One Direction we also have the

777
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,079
edge in the other

778
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:54,160
direction all right so symmetric means

779
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,160
order doesn't matter and finally R is

780
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,440
transitive if Only If For All A B and C

781
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,640
in

782
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,359
a if a relates to

783
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,680
B and B relates to

784
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,680
C then a relates to

785
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,400
C so if this is the same as that and

786
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,000
that's the same as this other thing then

787
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,720
this should be the same as this other

788
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,359
thing another thing that we might want

789
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,680
to be true if we're trying to capture

790
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,280
what we mean by sameness

791
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,359
uh in terms of graphs it means that

792
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,000
anytime we

793
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,440
have a walk of length

794
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,839
two then there was already a directed

795
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,119
Edge from the start to the

796
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,599
end if you can get from here to there

797
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,280
and from there to this other place then

798
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,119
you can get straight from here to this

799
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,240
other

800
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,560
place all right and and both of these

801
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,319
examples that I mentioned um all three

802
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,079
of these examples

803
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:59,440
um same

804
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,440
connected component

805
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,520
component so these circled relations I

806
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:08,520
claim all have all three of these

807
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,079
properties every number is congruent to

808
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,800
itself mod 10 if two numbers are

809
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:15,599
congruent to each other mod 10 then

810
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,400
they're congruent the other way mod 10

811
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,400
and if a and b are congruent and B and C

812
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,720
are congruent then A and C are congruent

813
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,880
mod

814
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,640
10 um and you can check that all of

815
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,640
those examples have this property and in

816
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,640
fact I claim that these three properties

817
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,040
are

818
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,880
enough um unfortunately I have to put

819
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,599
the definition very far away

820
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,240
from um or sorry the theorem very far

821
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,720
away from that

822
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,720
definition we'll make it

823
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,160
work bye

824
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:59,319
eraser okay definition r

825
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,319
is an equivalence relation

826
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,240
relation if and only if R is all three

827
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,240
of those things

828
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,240
symmetric um sorry

829
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,560
reflexive symmetric and

830
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,960
transitive and we have a theorem that

831
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:30,280
back up my claim that says this is all

832
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,280
we need for

833
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,280
sess

834
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,160
theorem

835
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,160
um if

836
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,040
R which is a relation on a is an

837
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,040
equivalence

838
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:56,000
relation if R is an equivalence

839
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,000
relation then are partitions

840
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:06,839
a into some collection of subsets A1

841
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:10,000
Union A2 Union A3 Union and so on and

842
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,000
this is going to be a disjoint

843
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:17,920
Union um such that

844
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,920
every a in

845
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,560
a belongs

846
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,160
to exactly one of our

847
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,319
subsets that's what it means to be a

848
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,280
partition that we're breaking a into

849
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,160
smaller pieces where every element of a

850
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,880
is in exactly one of our

851
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:44,640
pieces um such that a relates to

852
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:47,640
B if and only if a and b are in the

853
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,640
same

854
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,880
subset so anytime we have an equivalent

855
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,079
relation that satisfies these three

856
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,839
axioms then that exactly forms a

857
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,079
partition which tells us precisely what

858
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:02,480
our relation is our relation just says

859
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,000
you're related if and only if you're in

860
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,520
the same

861
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,400
subset for example if we're talking

862
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:14,560
about congruence mod 10 the parts of our

863
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,880
partition are well we have the set 0 10

864
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,319
minus 10 uh 20 minus

865
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,480
20 this is one part of a partition

866
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:26,240
everything in the set is congruent to

867
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,160
everything else in this set and not

868
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,559
congruent to anything else outside the

869
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,520
set then we also have 1 and 11 and 9 and

870
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,839
21

871
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,640
and9 here's another part of our

872
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:40,760
partition all of these numbers are

873
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,920
congruent to each other and congruent to

874
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:47,240
none of the other numbers and in in

875
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,160
total there are 10 of these

876
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,359
parts so anytime we have an equivalence

877
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,400
relation we can partition our um our set

878
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,680
into subsets uh that exactly tells us

879
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,319
what our relation is is

880
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,440
yes yeah so the union with a DOT here

881
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,800
the dot is there to emphasize that we're

882
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,640
taking the union of sets that are

883
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,280
disjoint uh that no no element is in

884
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,680
multiple of these sets I know I wrote it

885
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,400
out here in words but I like to

886
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,359
emphasize it in the formula as

887
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,280
well um when we're talking about

888
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:25,480
connectivity in in an undirected graph

889
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,160
um being connected to each other a pair

890
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,440
of vertices are connected if and only if

891
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,240
they're in the same connected

892
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,480
component and so the connected

893
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,640
components form the pieces of our

894
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,240
partition so we've seen multiple

895
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,200
examples of this this is just making

896
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,960
this more General and more abstract

897
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,880
anytime we satisfy all three of those

898
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,680
axioms we get

899
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,559
this all

900
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,000
right so the other kind of subset I want

901
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,000
to talk about

902
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,280
actually before that we had a couple

903
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:08,000
more examples we had this example

904
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:11,960
of a less equal B A divides B set a is a

905
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,200
subset of set B these are other common

906
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,440
relations that we work with and these

907
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,800
are not equivalence

908
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,760
relations right um we know that two

909
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,720
divides 10 but 10 doesn't divide two so

910
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,839
it's not symmetric like we wanted with

911
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,040
equivalence

912
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:31,040
relations but in many ways

913
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,920
a divides B behaves a lot like a less

914
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,640
equal b or a subset of B there's some

915
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,079
commonality

916
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,160
there um and that commonality we're

917
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,440
going to

918
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,440
Define as what are called weak partial

919
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,440
orders

920
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,960
so weak partial order our goal is going

921
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,960
to be

922
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:17,880
behaves like a less than equal B A is a

923
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,800
subset of B A divides B Etc so let's see

924
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,319
if we can capture what these all have in

925
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,520
common and prove something about

926
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,680
them so

927
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:34,400
again okay so let's see

928
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:38,839
R is a weak partial order weak partial

929
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,839
order if and only if R

930
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,280
is are these all

931
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,359
reflexive is a number always less equal

932
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:51,880
to itself does it divide itself is a set

933
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,880
a subset of itself yes so these are all

934
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,640
reflexive so let's add that to our

935
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,640
desired definition for weak partial

936
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,319
order

937
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,480
we already said it's not symmetric so

938
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:01,160
we're probably going to have to replace

939
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,440
that

940
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,960
somehow are these

941
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,520
transitive if a less equal B and B less

942
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:13,880
equal C is a less equal c yeah same for

943
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,880
subsets same for divides so let's put

944
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,280
that so this is looking very similar to

945
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,359
the def to the definition of equivalence

946
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,680
relation we're going to make one tweak

947
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:26,200
instead of requiring it to be symmetric

948
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,920
we're going to require it to be

949
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,920
anti-symmetric

950
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,599
which does not mean not symmetric it's a

951
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:41,559
different concept let's define

952
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:41,559
that so R is

953
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,800
anti

954
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,640
symmetric

955
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,640
means for all A and

956
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:58,839
B if a relates to B and B relates to a

957
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,480
then a equal

958
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:07,319
B so the only way that you relate in

959
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,319
both directions is if you're comparing

960
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:11,960
yourself to

961
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:13,960
yourself that is certainly True For Less

962
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,599
equal if we know that a is less equal b

963
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:20,119
and a is greater equal B than a equals B

964
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,640
that's true for subset as well if we

965
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:23,319
have two sets and each of them is a

966
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,480
subset of the other then they're exactly

967
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,319
the same

968
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,319
set and so this is going to be our Axiom

969
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:31,800
if R is reflexive anti- symmetric like

970
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,720
that and

971
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,400
transitive we're going to Define that to

972
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:39,240
be a weak partial order and that's going

973
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,520
to be our notion of behaving like these

974
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,720
familiar

975
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,720
examples and so why is a weak partial

976
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,599
order useful what can we prove about

977
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,440
them what can we do with

978
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,640
them well just like equivalence

979
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,400
relations um had a different

980
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,400
characterization in terms of partitions

981
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,400
of a

982
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,000
set uh we

983
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,599
can prove that equivalence Rel sorry

984
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,319
prove that weak partial orders are

985
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,319
related to dags

986
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,760
claim

987
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,160
uh

988
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,160
yes if G is a

989
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,280
diaph then the walk relation

990
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:34,200
G

991
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,200
star is a weak partial

992
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,480
order if and only if G is a

993
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,760
dag so the point of weak partial order

994
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,319
is that we can sort of put things in

995
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,920
sort in somewhat increasing order of

996
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:57,280
size um if a is less than b less equal B

997
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,000
less equal C less equal D less equal e

998
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,799
what we want to avoid is coming back

999
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,760
around and E is less equal

1000
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:08,079
a

1001
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:11,160
um because as it turns out that's going

1002
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,640
to um that's going to break some of

1003
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:16,079
these

1004
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:19,319
axioms and so what all we're saying is

1005
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,920
that satisfying these three axioms is

1006
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:23,440
equivalent to being the walk relation on

1007
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,440
a

1008
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,760
dag and dags were defined by not having

1009
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,720
Direction Ed

1010
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,640
Cycles all right uh we're not going to

1011
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,640
prove this but it's true you can come

1012
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:40,119
ask me about it later if you'd

1013
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:41,599
like um last definition for now once

1014
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:44,160
again I apologize there are lots of

1015
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,160
definitions

1016
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,400
today but I want to bring our attention

1017
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:56,359
to this word partial a weak partial

1018
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,960
order just like we had partial function

1019
00:49:56,359 --> 00:50:01,920
that might be missing values a weak

1020
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,040
partial order might be missing

1021
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,119
comparisons for

1022
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:11,920
example um the set

1023
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:15,839
21 and the set um

1024
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:20,480
27 is one a subset of the

1025
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:20,480
other no in neither direction is that

1026
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:28,720
true so here are two sets and neither

1027
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,240
is related to the other one under this

1028
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,440
subset

1029
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,640
relation um so this is a pair that

1030
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,760
cannot be

1031
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:45,480
compared um so if R is a weak partial

1032
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,480
order we'll say that A and B are

1033
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,200
comparable if and only if the relation

1034
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,160
goes in in in at least one of the two

1035
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,680
directions a relates to b or B relates

1036
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,359
to a

1037
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,359
otherwise they're

1038
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,559
incomparable so these two sets 21 and 27

1039
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:20,200
are incomparable under this subset equal

1040
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,200
relation all right and now finally

1041
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:34,520
a weak partial

1042
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,520
order is called a total

1043
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,559
order if and only if every

1044
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,240
pair is

1045
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,680
comparable so whenever you have two

1046
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,280
elements you can always put them in

1047
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,720
order one of them is less equal to the

1048
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,240
other one so that's certainly true for

1049
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:00,680
the less equal

1050
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,160
relation it's not true for the subset

1051
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,440
relation and it's not true for the

1052
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,760
divides relation two and three are

1053
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,240
incomparable under the divides

1054
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:14,359
relation but if every pair can be

1055
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,760
compared uh then it's called a total

1056
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:18,680
order and if you have a total order then

1057
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,520
really all you have is just an entire

1058
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,480
line of them organized by size a total

1059
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,079
order is um the the most structure you

1060
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,960
can have it's just everything is ordered

1061
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,960
and there's there's no

1062
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,280
ambiguity all

1063
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,040
right so that is everything I wanted to

1064
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,359
say on the relations side of things

1065
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:44,359
today now let's move on to the other

1066
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:47,000
part of today's lecture which is

1067
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:50,160
counting uh and I don't mean counting

1068
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,559
like 1 2 3 4 five I assume all of us are

1069
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,599
capable of counting at least to like 300

1070
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,280
or

1071
00:52:53,599 --> 00:53:01,559
so um no but by Counting I

1072
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:04,920
mean counting the size of a

1073
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:07,720
set um if if you want to know like

1074
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,960
here's a comically large deck of playing

1075
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,119
cards how many different ways are there

1076
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,760
to shuffle them how many different

1077
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:17,200
orderings are there for the 52 cards in

1078
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,760
the deck here's one of those

1079
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,119
orderings here's a different one Etc how

1080
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,520
many orderings are there for this deck

1081
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,520
of cards does anyone know

1082
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,880
yes 52 factorial

1083
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:34,599
absolutely so the number of

1084
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,599
orders for a deck of

1085
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:41,680
cards is 52 factorial and we'll see why

1086
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,520
later in this course or later in this

1087
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,680
lecture in fact um how

1088
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,680
many uh

1089
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:58,440
trees are are there whose vertices are

1090
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,440
exactly the set 1 2 3 up to n

1091
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,480
does anyone

1092
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,720
know I'd honestly be surprised it's not

1093
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,240
an easy problem um but this is the kind

1094
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,480
of problem that we're going to try to be

1095
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,839
able to answer and we're going to look

1096
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,440
at techniques for trying to answer in

1097
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:18,440
this case the number of trees on that

1098
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,920
set of vertices is n to the N minus 2

1099
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,280
which I love I find that kind of magical

1100
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,599
there are lots of cool ways to prove it

1101
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,680
we're not going to prove it together but

1102
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,040
come ask me if you're interested but

1103
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,680
these are the kinds questions we're

1104
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,359
going to try to ask here's a set of

1105
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:34,640
things how many things are there uh and

1106
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:37,480
to get us a little more in the

1107
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,040
mood uh for counting I have a short

1108
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,559
story I want to tell you uh the parable

1109
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,680
of the two Shepherds no one calls at

1110
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,960
that that's just

1111
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:50,720
me um so this first Shepherd this first

1112
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,760
Shepherd you know every morning has to

1113
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,079
let the Sheep out to graze every evening

1114
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,559
bring the Sheep back in to protect them

1115
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:00,040
from wolves I guess I don't know what

1116
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,520
Shepherds do um but unfortunately this

1117
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,400
Shepherd does not know how to count like

1118
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,520
grade school style one two three that

1119
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:10,880
the shepherd doesn't have words for

1120
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,880
numbers above three so how do they make

1121
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,920
sure that all of their 50 something

1122
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,720
sheep go out in the morning and come

1123
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,640
back in in the evening if they can't

1124
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,119
count the

1125
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,720
sheep and a classic answer to this which

1126
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,680
may or may not have historical Merit but

1127
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,240
um all all mathematicians who have

1128
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,039
studied counting have heard this story

1129
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,359
at least once um the classic example is

1130
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,280
every time you let a sheep out of the

1131
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:37,480
pen you put a pebble in your

1132
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,640
pocket another sheep another Pebble

1133
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,520
another sheep another Pebble at the end

1134
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,680
of the day when you're bringing the

1135
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,720
Sheep back in every time a sheep comes

1136
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,920
in you take a pebble out of your

1137
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,079
pocket and when all the sheep have come

1138
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,240
in that's the same moment that all the

1139
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,760
Pebbles are out of your pocket so when

1140
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,680
your pocket's empty you know there are

1141
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,440
no more

1142
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:59,520
sheep and VI Versa if there are Pebbles

1143
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,280
left in your pocket there are still

1144
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,319
sheep out there and you have to go find

1145
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,880
them if your pocket's empty and there

1146
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:06,119
are more sheep coming in well something

1147
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,960
weird happened and you probably stole

1148
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:10,440
from your

1149
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,760
neighbor um but the point is um for

1150
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,359
these next couple lectures in our

1151
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,480
counting unit we count with

1152
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:21,240
correspondences we count with BS which

1153
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:23,119
we defined on one of these boards um if

1154
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,319
we can set up a on toone correspondence

1155
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,400
everything in this set corresponds to

1156
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:29,359
everything in this set and everyone has

1157
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,559
a partner no one has two partners no one

1158
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,880
is missing a

1159
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,280
partner then there are the same number

1160
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,839
of things on both sides what that

1161
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,680
Shepherd is doing is basically making

1162
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:39,160
sure that there's always a

1163
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,720
correspondence between sheep that are

1164
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,039
out there and Pebbles in their pocket

1165
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,799
they don't have to keep track of what

1166
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,920
that correspondence is and in fact it

1167
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:51,160
might change if you initially put a

1168
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,480
pebble in your pocket for sheep Deborah

1169
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,280
um you're not keeping track of which

1170
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,720
Pebble corresponds to sheep Deborah so

1171
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,720
when Deborah comes back in in you might

1172
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,079
remove the pebble that was assigned to

1173
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,799
Sandy I I I don't know why I'm picking

1174
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,799
these

1175
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:06,799
names um

1176
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,440
but you don't care what that

1177
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,240
correspondence is as long as there is a

1178
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,039
correspondence between pebbles in your

1179
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,720
pocket and sheep that are still

1180
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:16,480
grazing um so the moral here is we count

1181
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,359
with

1182
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,799
correspondences the second Shepherd uh

1183
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,319
the second Shepherd knows how to count

1184
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:25,200
that's totally fine not a problem we

1185
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:27,280
have language um but the shepherd has an

1186
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,799
overeager apprentice

1187
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,839
this Apprentice runs in one evening and

1188
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:33,480
says master I brought all 40 sheep into

1189
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:35,440
the pen and the shepherd looks confused

1190
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,520
what do you what do you mean we only

1191
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,079
have 38 sheep don't worry master I

1192
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,079
rounded them

1193
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:47,839
up thank you no moral I just like bad

1194
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:56,520
puns I heard one groan thank you very

1195
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,280
much that warms my heart

1196
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,799
and now that we're in a great mood let's

1197
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,799
talk about

1198
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,720
counting all right so let's actually

1199
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,480
talk about

1200
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:11,039
counting um

1201
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,839
here first of all why do we care why are

1202
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,280
these tools that we

1203
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:18,839
need um in a in a computer science class

1204
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,119
why do we care about counting things

1205
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:23,640
well often when we're analyzing the

1206
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,480
runtime of an algorithm we're doing some

1207
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,160
step some number of times and we need to

1208
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,559
be able to count how many times we do

1209
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,160
that step in order to bound the runtime

1210
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:33,160
of the algorithm and prove that it runs

1211
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:40,760
fast um it's also useful for things like

1212
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,680
probability probability is built very

1213
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,640
heavily on top of counting and all of

1214
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,160
our counting techniques will transfer

1215
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:49,280
over to probability techniques as well

1216
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,880
and that'll be useful after Quiz 2 which

1217
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,920
is coming up next week by the

1218
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:58,400
way

1219
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,599
um but let's learn where my chalk is

1220
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,200
found

1221
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,319
it let's learn some techniques for

1222
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:07,119
counting the first one I want to mention

1223
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,119
is called the product

1224
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,680
rule um which says that for finite

1225
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:25,640
sets A and B the size of A cross B

1226
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,880
equals the size of a Time the size of B

1227
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,200
remember A cross B is the set of all

1228
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,200
possible pairs where the first element

1229
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,000
is in a and the second element is in B

1230
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,400
so the number of ways to choose an

1231
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,240
element from a and then choose an

1232
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,400
element from B is the size of a times

1233
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:45,559
the size of

1234
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,559
B uh and this generalizes as

1235
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:55,799
well if we have K uh if we have n

1236
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,799
different sets

1237
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,920
and we're looking

1238
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,799
at um ordered sequences where the first

1239
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,200
element comes from A1 the second element

1240
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:09,079
comes from A2 the third element from A3

1241
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:12,359
and all the way down the number of such

1242
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:15,240
sequences is just the size of A1 times

1243
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:16,839
the size of A2 all the way to the size

1244
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,319
of

1245
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:21,039
a so if we're if we have to choose an

1246
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:23,000
element of A1 and then choose an element

1247
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:25,599
of A2 and then choose an element of A3

1248
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,960
and all the way down the number of ways

1249
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:32,079
we can make that choice in its entirety

1250
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:36,240
is size of A1 time size of A2 time size

1251
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,240
of A3 all the way down for

1252
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:45,640
example the number

1253
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:48,640
of length and

1254
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,640
binary

1255
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,280
sequences so a binary sequence is a

1256
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,599
sequence of zeros and ones just zeros

1257
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,720
and ones and we're asking how many

1258
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,440
length and binary sequences are there

1259
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:06,119
well the set of length and binary

1260
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:09,200
sequences is 01 * 01

1261
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:11,680
times 01 n

1262
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,680
times this is precisely the set of

1263
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,760
binary sequences this is what we mean by

1264
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,880
binary sequence first element is a zero

1265
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,520
or a one second element is a zero or a

1266
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:23,680
one all the way down and the generalized

1267
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:27,079
product rule or sorry the the general

1268
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:30,200
version of the product rule says that

1269
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:35,640
this set the size of this set is just

1270
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:39,079
the size of 01 times the size of

1271
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,079
01 all the way

1272
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:48,160
down which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 n * so there

1273
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,880
are two to the end binary sequences of

1274
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,520
length n does that make

1275
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,920
sense

1276
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:58,359
wonderful uh next let's look at the

1277
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,359
ejection

1278
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:17,480
rule if there exists a

1279
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,480
bje from A to

1280
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,119
B then A and B have the same

1281
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,960
size this is what that first Shepherd

1282
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,760
was doing if there exists a bje between

1283
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,119
two sets the sets have the same size

1284
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,880
because we're just pairing them up one

1285
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:37,160
to one uh no one is repeated no one is

1286
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,160
excluded uh and as an example of

1287
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:41,680
this how many

1288
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:48,240
subsets of 1 through n are

1289
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,599
there so if we're looking at all of the

1290
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,160
subsets of 1 through n of any length um

1291
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,760
could be length zero where we take none

1292
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,480
of the elements length n where we take

1293
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,680
all the elements or any length in

1294
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,119
between where we take some of the

1295
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:08,839
elements and not others how many subsets

1296
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:14,039
are there well let's use the bje rule I

1297
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:17,000
claim um set of

1298
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:21,400
subsets of 1 through

1299
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,400
n is in bje

1300
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:33,119
with BN and I'm going to Define this um

1301
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,640
BN

1302
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,640
is binary

1303
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,119
sequences of length

1304
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:44,079
n so the thing we counted in the last

1305
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:46,520
example I claim that the set of subsets

1306
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:49,480
of 1 through n is injection with the set

1307
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:53,000
of those length n binary

1308
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:55,039
sequences and to prove that we can just

1309
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,240
Define our function and verify that it's

1310
01:03:55,039 --> 01:04:01,119
a bje

1311
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,119
so given a binary

1312
01:04:02,279 --> 01:04:09,880
sequence B1

1313
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:13,640
B2 BN where each of these is zero or

1314
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:16,039
one I'm going to map that to a subset of

1315
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,039
1 through

1316
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:25,960
n i in 1 through n such that bi equal 1

1317
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,319
we send it to the subset of indices that

1318
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,359
have value

1319
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:33,000
one so you can think of this as a set as

1320
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:35,559
a sequence of binary decisions do we

1321
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,880
keep element one or throw it away do we

1322
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:42,240
keep element two or throw it away all

1323
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:46,440
the way down for example 0 1

1324
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:50,680
0 0 1 1 if n is

1325
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,680
six then this maps to the

1326
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:59,319
subset 2 five and six

1327
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,480
because those are the indices that have

1328
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:04,160
ones all right and we're not going to do

1329
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,640
it now but you can verify that this

1330
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:11,279
gives a bje between the set BN and the

1331
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,279
set of subsets of 1 through

1332
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:17,640
n

1333
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,640
claim this is a

1334
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,599
bijection you'll see more examples in

1335
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,160
your homework of how what details we

1336
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:27,160
would need to check to verify more

1337
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:29,760
carefully that this really is a b

1338
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:32,440
section um but intuitively they're sort

1339
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,960
of encoding the same information each

1340
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,680
each number from 1 through n is either

1341
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:40,160
included or excluded that's a binary

1342
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:42,520
decision the the I bit is either one or

1343
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,520
zero that's a binary decision so we're

1344
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,960
just corresponding those two

1345
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,960
things all right

1346
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:55,559
next we have the product rule the bje

1347
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,559
rule now we have the sum rule

1348
01:06:03,799 --> 01:06:09,079
some rule says that if a and b are

1349
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,839
disjoint so there they have no elements

1350
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:19,119
in

1351
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:22,839
common then the size of a union B is the

1352
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,839
size of a plus the size of

1353
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,680
B right

1354
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,640
so if I

1355
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:34,720
have five cards in my right hand and

1356
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,319
three cards in my left hand and I I

1357
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,960
don't have any cards in both hands uh

1358
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:40,960
then I'm holding eight cards five plus

1359
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:47,119
three uh and more

1360
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:51,279
generally um if I'm taking the size of a

1361
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,279
disjoint Union of N

1362
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,079
Things if all of these AIS are disjoint

1363
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:58,720
with each other

1364
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,200
then this is the size of A1 Plus the

1365
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,160
size of

1366
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:07,240
A2 plus the size of

1367
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,240
a and let's see that in

1368
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:18,520
action

1369
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,440
okay so all of us who have not been

1370
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,799
using password managers all our lives

1371
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,760
have have frequently been told choose

1372
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:27,520
another password that has these specific

1373
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,440
requirements it has this length it must

1374
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,160
use a special character it has to do all

1375
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,799
this other stuff which just makes it

1376
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:36,920
harder for me to remember it um anyway

1377
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:39,400
I'm going to I'm going to play that role

1378
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:42,599
now how

1379
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,599
many uh

1380
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:53,079
passwords have

1381
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,079
length between six and8

1382
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,559
inclusive start with a capital

1383
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:09,520
letter um and the

1384
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:09,520
rest are capital or lowercase

1385
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,319
letters and or

1386
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,199
digits the digits aren't capital or

1387
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,880
lowercase they're just digits so how

1388
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:25,279
many passwords have length between six

1389
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,480
and 8 start with a capital letter and

1390
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:30,880
then finish with whatever whatever

1391
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:34,440
whatever letters or digits you

1392
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:37,319
want and with this it's useful to break

1393
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:41,719
it up into cases based on the length of

1394
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:43,679
your password I claim that um the set W

1395
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:46,600
I called it w in the notes for some

1396
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,120
reason um W for

1397
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,640
password um I claim that W is the

1398
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,640
disjoint

1399
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:59,040
Union of the set of passwords of length

1400
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,799
six that satisfy the other properties

1401
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,839
set of passwords of length seven and set

1402
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,719
of passwords of length eight so if we

1403
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:07,839
can count each of these three subsets

1404
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,640
then we add them up and get the size of

1405
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:14,719
w and let's see if we can do that so

1406
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,359
what is the size of W6 how many

1407
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:19,600
passwords

1408
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:19,600
satisfy this

1409
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:28,040
property well I claim the set W6 itself

1410
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,040
as a

1411
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:35,960
set is well first of all the set

1412
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:39,799
of uh capital letters for the first

1413
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:43,279
entry times the set

1414
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:46,520
of letters or

1415
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:49,239
digits to the fifth for the other five

1416
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,759
entries this is exactly what this set is

1417
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:53,440
the first entry has to be a capital

1418
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:56,080
letter the other five characters can be

1419
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:59,239
anything from this set

1420
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:02,480
so we have this product of six

1421
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:05,520
sets um and that brings us back to the

1422
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,960
regular product rule so by the product

1423
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,560
rule the size of

1424
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:12,320
W6 is well how many capital letters are

1425
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,320
there I think that's

1426
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:20,640
26 and then how many letters and digits

1427
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:24,280
are there 26 26 and 10 so that's 50

1428
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:27,320
62 to the 5th we just use the regular

1429
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,320
product rule to get this

1430
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:35,800
and we can do the same thing for W7 and

1431
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:52,280
W8 W7 is going to be 26 * 62 this time

1432
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,920
to the sixth because there are six extra

1433
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:59,640
digits after the F extra characters

1434
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,640
after the first one and the size of

1435
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:09,920
W8 is 26 * 62

1436
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:11,840
7 so by the sum rule since W is the

1437
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:16,400
disjoint Union of these three different

1438
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:21,440
sets the size of w is the size of W6

1439
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,440
plus the size of W7 plus the size of

1440
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:31,920
W8 which is 26 * 62 5th + 26 * 62 6 + 26

1441
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,480
* 62

1442
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,199
7th so we use the sum rule to break it

1443
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,840
up into three separate cases and then

1444
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:40,120
use the product rule for each of those

1445
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,840
cases did that make

1446
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:45,400
sense wonderful all

1447
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:49,120
right

1448
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:53,280
um so this is a a common strategy here

1449
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:56,840
um notice that we're we're using the sum

1450
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:59,560
rule when what we mean is is or you can

1451
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,920
choose a password of length six or a

1452
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,920
password of length seven or a password

1453
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,440
of length

1454
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:08,480
eight so

1455
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,880
or means

1456
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:15,239
sum for product rule you have to choose

1457
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,040
a capital letter and then choose one of

1458
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:18,639
these characters and then choose one of

1459
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,960
these characters and then choose one of

1460
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,679
these characters I forget how many times

1461
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:27,520
I've said it but you know five times for

1462
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:27,520
this part we multiply when we mean

1463
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:36,360
and said differently if I have 10 shirts

1464
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:40,199
and six pants in my

1465
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:44,360
closet um if I want to choose an article

1466
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:45,639
of clothing I can choose a shirt or a

1467
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:49,320
pair of

1468
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:52,679
pants and there are 16 options 10 plus

1469
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:54,080
6 um or means add on the other hand if

1470
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:56,639
I'm trying to put together an outfit for

1471
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,560
the day I have to choose a shirt and a

1472
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:00,520
pair of

1473
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:03,600
pants and means multiply it's 10times

1474
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,440
six options so I have 60 outfits maybe

1475
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,960
not all of those look good but I wear

1476
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,280
the same pants every day anyway so it

1477
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,480
doesn't

1478
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:13,960
matter um did does this make sense

1479
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,920
generally speaking or means add and

1480
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,360
means

1481
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,280
times okay uh the last example I want to

1482
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,000
talk about

1483
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,000
today is called the generalized product

1484
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
rule

1485
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:35,080
and example first in fact an example we

1486
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:37,560
mentioned earlier how many

1487
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,320
different permutations are there for a

1488
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,159
set of 52 cards how many different

1489
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,840
orderings are there for a set of 52

1490
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:46,080
cards let's talk through this

1491
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,120
together here here are the cards I I

1492
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,040
can't hold them all at once with with my

1493
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:55,960
notes and my chalk so bye-bye

1494
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,960
cards so how many permutations

1495
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,960
of the 52

1496
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:05,960
cards well let's think about it let's

1497
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,360
choose the first card first which card

1498
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:11,120
is going to go at the beginning of our

1499
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:14,199
list well how many options do we

1500
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:17,560
have we have the whole deck to play with

1501
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:19,600
okay I think I do want to hold the

1502
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,480
cards we have the whole deck to play

1503
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,719
with we can choose any one of the cards

1504
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:26,800
as our first card yeah maybe I choose

1505
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,199
this one I'm doing a magic trick to

1506
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,080
myself I don't know what card this is um

1507
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:33,080
so the nine of Spades is going to be the

1508
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:36,199
first card in our

1509
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:39,840
ordering so this was the nine of Spades

1510
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:41,199
and we had 52 options for it yeah great

1511
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,199
okay that goes at the beginning of our

1512
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:48,520
order what's the next card we

1513
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:52,800
pick well how many options do we have

1514
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:56,560
left just Shout It Out 51 yeah we have

1515
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,000
51 options Maybe maybe we choose this

1516
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,239
one without dropping all the others

1517
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,520
eight of clubs great that's the second

1518
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:05,840
card in our order eight of

1519
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:11,159
clubs now let's all watch as I do this

1520
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:12,920
50 more times no um but we get the idea

1521
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:14,440
um the next card the third card in my

1522
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,520
ordering well I've used two cards

1523
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:22,000
already I have to choose one of the

1524
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:24,760
remaining 50 cards then 49 then

1525
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,360
48 then two then one this is the number

1526
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:30,000
of choices I have at each

1527
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:35,320
stage so it feels like by the product

1528
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:39,920
rule this answer should be 52 * 51 * 50

1529
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:39,920
* 49 and so on 52

1530
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,000
factorial the weird thing though is that

1531
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:47,679
this isn't the product

1532
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,800
rule product rule says you have some set

1533
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,280
of options at the beginning which is

1534
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,040
true we have the set of 52 cards at the

1535
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,719
beginning but then we're supposed to

1536
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:58,960
have the same set of options for the

1537
01:15:55,719 --> 01:16:01,400
next entry every time but the set of

1538
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,080
options we have in the second round

1539
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,880
depends on which card we picked in the

1540
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,679
first

1541
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,600
round right there are always 51 options

1542
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:11,000
because we've always excluded one card

1543
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,560
from the first round but the set of

1544
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,080
options changes depending on what we

1545
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,480
picked in the first

1546
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:20,040
round so this isn't straightup product

1547
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:22,760
rule the set of permutations is not just

1548
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:25,120
set of 52 cards time set of 51 cards

1549
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:28,159
time set of 50 cards even though though

1550
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,360
the number of options at each stage is

1551
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:31,719
always the same and that's what the

1552
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:35,120
generalized product rule does for us it

1553
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:38,840
basically says if the number of options

1554
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:41,320
at every step of the process is always

1555
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,800
consistent even if this particular set

1556
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:46,280
of those options might change then the

1557
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:48,199
number of ways to make your choices is

1558
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:50,880
just the product of the number of

1559
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:50,880
choices at each

1560
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,840
stage so

1561
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:02,120
this is the gener generalized product

1562
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:08,600
rule if a is a

1563
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:12,600
set

1564
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,600
of length K

1565
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:24,480
sequences where there

1566
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,480
are N1 choices

1567
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:31,880
um for the first entry for

1568
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:31,880
A1 and two

1569
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:35,960
choices for

1570
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:42,120
A2 no

1571
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,120
matter what A1 was

1572
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:51,960
chosen

1573
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:54,960
Etc uh exactly a uh sorry exactly n i

1574
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,960
choices

1575
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,560
for AI for the I entry in our

1576
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:08,639
sequence no matter what A1 through a IUS

1577
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,639
one were

1578
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:17,520
chosen and all the way down to NK at the

1579
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:21,960
end so if earlier choices don't change

1580
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,960
the number of options we have in later

1581
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,600
steps then the size of a

1582
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:30,480
is N1 *

1583
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,520
N2 up to

1584
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,840
NK sound

1585
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,360
good cool we will get more practice with

1586
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:41,800
that next time uh and I will see you

1587
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,800
then thank you
