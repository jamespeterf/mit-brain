1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,040
thank uh the MIT ILP uh program to have

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,000
this opportunity to to speak to you so

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,880
my name is Ali uh Merchant and iq3

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,680
connect is all about providing scalable

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,039
3D environments for Learning and

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,039
collaboration and

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,519
uh as a startup you know we work we are

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,439
interacting with companies in advanced

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,119
manufacturing they're building complex

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,480
products or they have complex processes

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,239
like they operating you know machines or

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,520
whatever and this is what we hear from

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,360
them you know they're building a product

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,600
it's about you know quality timeliness

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
you know getting more efficiency they're

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,640
worried about disruptions and threats

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,719
like covid uh but one of the other

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,480
interesting areas is also around you

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,800
know uh their their Workforce Workforce

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,840
Development Workforce training losing

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,719
knowledge we heard about you know

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,879
retiring Workforce so these are some of

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,359
the challenges that um and companies

24
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,120
that we're working with and uh the

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
question is how do you virtualize some

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,760
of these complex environments you're

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,080
manufacturing something I can physically

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,799
explain to you how to you know

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,320
disassemble a machine but if I want to

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,479
do this in a virtual environment how do

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,119
I do that do I use a PDF do I use a flat

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,400
screen a zoom and so these are the

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,720
challenges that you know when we talk

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,320
about digital how do you how do you

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,759
capture these complex environments

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,920
whether you're you're bringing in a

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,799
supplier uh to to you know in in man

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,320
manufacturing or you're training a

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,320
worker to operate a machine or safely

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,079
operate a

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,399
machine and so what we have done is we

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,920
are providing highly scalable 3D virtual

43
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,560
environments where uh what you see here

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
is essentially a 3D workspace and it

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,079
works in a browser so there are a number

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,479
of companies that are providing 3D

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,079
Solutions but what we're doing is making

48
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,439
this extremely fast and easy and very

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,000
very scalable and that's really

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,640
important for this to be adopted at

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,399
scale uh uh in an environment and we

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
have Global customers that are using

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,399
this for for manufacturing uh for

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,800
Workforce training and and many other

55
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,800
applications across the the product life

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,480
cycle uh and I'd like to talk about a

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
customer success here uh this is Sierra

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,200
space and uh it's very interesting

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,879
because in a matter of a few months they

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,400
were able to scale this

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,720
technology uh into their production

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,200
environment and what you see here is uh

63
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,280
you know one of their vehicles and they

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,120
were able to digitize this and bring in

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,440
bring this into the iq3 environment it

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,360
has a million components they can access

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,640
it from anywhere in the company and that

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,760
completely changes the game so now

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,800
instead of sharing documents I can

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,640
simply send you a link and you can just

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,480
be in the spatial environment with this

72
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,400
vehicle and and that was the a game

73
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,239
changer for them and so what you see

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
here is an approved image by Sierra uh

75
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,080
space and they're able to you know make

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,200
this accessible to the entire company uh

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,080
and it had real immediate business uh

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,400
outcomes you know so they were able to

79
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,239
incorporate this into some of their

80
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,640
procedures which they did not have any

81
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,239
tool for before so I asked them how

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,040
would you do this before and they said

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,159
well we would actually have to go

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,879
physically and do this on the real

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,760
vehicle now we can bring that digital

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,280
record of this vehicle to them and it's

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,120
accessible all the way from the top

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,920
management down to the worker uh to the

89
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,920
to the employee on the manufacturing

90
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,879
floor they have multiple teams

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,680
demonstrating this techn you know using

92
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,920
this as a tool so uh very quickly and

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,799
very easily just using it as a as a tool

94
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,519
in their daily work and they able to use

95
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,439
this also for solving a number of uh

96
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,159
designed issues and really solve uh you

97
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,599
know address their uh contractual

98
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,920
obligations which was a huge

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,080
issue another aspect of this is the

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
Workforce Development so not only did we

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,560
we we have an industrial success but we

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,360
were able to put a a high school teacher

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,079
with about 25 years of High School

104
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,200
teaching into this complex environment

105
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,439
and now take this tool into the

106
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,720
classroom for really you know teaching

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,159
the the kids so K through 12 and this is

108
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,280
creating new Pathways and this was

109
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,280
recognized by the National Space Council

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,720
and so we working with the Department of

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,400
uh labor and education in Colorado to

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,639
really uh you know change how they're

113
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,799
looking at uh uh upscaling and and this

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
Workforce Development challenge in the

115
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,160
United

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,160
States uh minimizing the barriers so so

117
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,919
we're a startup you know how do we get a

118
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,600
tool like this which is completely

119
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,400
changing work because you're going from

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,919
documents 2D you know screen sharing to

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,320
a completely immersive 3D environment so

122
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,800
we made this extremely easy to use uh

123
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,280
minimal user training it has to just

124
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,440
work uh in your existing

125
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,840
environment uh the web browser access

126
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,320
was a big issue so that's part of our

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,000
technology that makes this so as you

128
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,560
know you can just send somebody a link

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,919
and as quickly as you can open a browser

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,720
you can access this 3D digital model you

131
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,479
can access it on any device you can buy

132
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,320
a $300 meta headset and now you can

133
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,080
immerse yourself in a one to one scale

134
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,759
uh model of this vehicle so it's

135
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,039
extremely easy to access and we've

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,240
created a complete uh pipeline where you

137
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,800
can you can create uh these 3D models

138
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,000
extremely quickly so it's a tool there's

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,400
no custom development and that made it

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,240
very easy for the company to adopt it in

141
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,039
various uh teams and programs it's also

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,759
secure so Aerospace environment security

143
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,800
is extremely important and uh we've done

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,440
many things to address that as well and

145
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,520
finally the Enterprise Readiness so it

146
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,280
has to you know integrate into

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,520
manufacturing execution systems PLM and

148
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,360
other business processes to really

149
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,800
overcome those barriers for scaling uh

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
and

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
adoption so our our partnership ask is

152
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,319
we've got this great technology and uh

153
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,360
we're looking for pilot engagements

154
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,840
Aerospace energy I know there are a

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,759
number of oil and gas companies here you

156
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,440
have complex products and operations uh

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,039
manufacturing as well as government and

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,560
education so we'd love to you know uh

159
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,319
talk more you know happy to talk about

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,000
uh our experience with Workforce

161
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,000
Development uh thank you very much
