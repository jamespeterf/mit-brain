00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
When I was a freshman at MIT, uh we

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,680
lived in a fraternity house on the

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,160
Boston side. And to get to class, you

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,280
had to go across the Mass Avenue Bridge,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,720
which is a long bridge. And our pledge

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,760
master said he wanted us to measure the

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,720
bridge. And he made all 14 of the

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,400
freshman stand up and looked at us and

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,240
said, "Smoot, you're the shortest, so

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,279
we'll do it in Smoots." How many uh

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,519
Smoots was it across the bridge?

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,680
364.4. four and an ear. When we got to

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,880
the last expansion joint, it came up to

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,280
about my knees. So, we did 04 and

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
decided that since we knew there were

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
errors in the measure that we'd be

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,320
honest engineers, and put a Greek E,

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,320
which means error measurement. And then

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,239
we decided that most people wouldn't

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
know what that meant. So, we wrote an

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,520
ear because maybe that's about the right

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,000
amount of error. For more MIT moments
