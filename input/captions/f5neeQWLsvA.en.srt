1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,960
so uh looking at the presentation it

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,040
seems like this may be more

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,519
computationally focused uh talk so just

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,920
quickly how many people here have heard

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:17,520
of quantum computers and know okay and H

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,240
how many of you all know about like what

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,720
they can do what what algorithms they

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,359
target okay very cool so just quickly

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,199
what what are these machines these

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,640
machines are new kinds of computers that

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,040
harness the power of quantum mechanics

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,480
okay this this is the same quantum

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,040
mechanics that governs uh the particles

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,920
at microscopic scale okay and these

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,719
particles could be atoms and molecules

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,160
the systems you see in biology and

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,039
partly when you go and you try to

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,600
simulate those systems using short injur

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,399
equation you require exponentially large

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,399
computational resources so the same

21
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,000
thing that makes it hard for you to

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,680
simulate those quantum mechanics systems

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,799
comes for free in quantum computers

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,520
which is why uh at a high level

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,320
intuition this is the reason why you

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,560
could expect exponential advantage in

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
simulating these Quantum systems using

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,360
quantum computers right so now that you

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,079
all are experts in Quantum Computing let

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,799
me tell you more about what we do so we

31
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,079
have a One-Stop platform that you can

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,119
use to get access to these all the

33
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,560
quantum software and Quantum Hardware

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,799
that's available in the market so we

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,720
work with over 50% of the quantum

36
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,000
Computing companies and make uh their

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:43,079
software and Hardware available in one

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,200
location okay and uh you can access at

39
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,439
at this point there's not a single

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,079
architecture that is a winner for

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,320
Quantum Computing you have whole bunch

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,159
of whole sorts of quantum computers uh

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,439
being made out of the super conducting

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,079
circuits you have atoms being used as

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,200
cubits you have crapped ions being used

46
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,520
so all of those are available for you to

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,280
test your Quantum algorithms uh and the

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,879
way we work with uh the various

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,040
different stakeholders is for the

50
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,360
Enterprise world we provide them uh

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,840
support for Quantum algorithms so if you

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,680
are an end user company will work with

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,800
you to come up with algorithms for your

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
specific use case so this is where we we

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,920
provide extra support but overall the

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
the platforms built for and uh anyone

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,360
who wants to use these machines and

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,480
write their algorithms we also work with

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,840
quantum computer uh Computing companies

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,519
to launch their software and Hardware on

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,280
your computer so it's sort of like a

62
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,840
Marketplace a single player place where

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,720
you can get access to all the different

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,800
Quantum algorithms specific to and the

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,480
these are some of our uh clients and

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,599
companies and partners who who we work

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,280
with specifically I would like to talk

68
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,560
uh to this audience about what quantum

69
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,400
computers can do for the biotech world

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,920
for the past year or so we've been

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,200
looking at this specific problem of beta

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,519
ameloid that you heard today about and

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,440
the the idea there is you have this beta

74
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,599
ameloid uh molecule and it's been widely

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,040
accepted for at least past 20 years it

76
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,200
interacts with metal ions and it it

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,519
leads to formation of these plaques so

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,640
the pathophysiology of this reaction is

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,360
actually not very well understood as to

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
where do these metal ions go and

81
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,439
interact with what active sites on these

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,040
beta ameloid molecules which lead to

83
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,400
these plaque formation right so if we

84
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,920
could understand this reaction maybe

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,360
there's an there might be an easier way

86
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,120
to uh develop drugs for for targeting

87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,640
that active side and uh thereby uh

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,799
allowing not allowing the the clumps to

89
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,400
form right and so uh this again you

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,480
probably already heard you you already

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,040
know it over hundred billion dollars

92
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,120
have spent in on Research understanding

93
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,120
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's with

94
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,040
relatively low progress and even this

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,079
amalo beta hypo hypothesis has been

96
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,280
brought under the question and so our

97
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,759
our job is like let let's look at it

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,959
from physics point of view to understand

99
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,840
whether um you you these protein

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,960
molecules interact with certain metal

101
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,960
ions and these lead to clumps so either

102
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
uh answer would be very cool and

103
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,880
actually NIH has spent two to 300

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
million dollars on just computational

105
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,039
studies and it comes back to you do

106
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,160
require exponentially uh large number of

107
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,080
computation resources and this is sort

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,680
of the problem that you can probably

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,400
address much faster using quantum

110
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,639
computers and the reason you have uh

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,400
even machine learning models fail is

112
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,880
because machine learning models need

113
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,039
need data and data has to come from

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,440
these quantum mechanical simulations so

115
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,880
if you can't even perform those

116
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,240
simulation where aren't you going to get

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,520
your data or you need Quantum sensors

118
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,479
which again you may know they aren't

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
ubiquitous or you don't have Quantum

120
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,720
sensors available in your body so which

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,199
is where machine learning models tend to

122
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,680
fail as well so here's the the pipeline

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,919
we've been working on when we have a

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,440
full functioning pipeline available here

125
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,600
what we do here is you have uh sort of

126
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,639
this protein molecule uh and you you you

127
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,800
what you do is you you fragmented into

128
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,199
smaller pieces and you recognize the

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,360
piece that has some strongly interacting

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,479
metal line ions and these are transition

131
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,199
uh Metals which are known to be hard uh

132
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,960
for classical algorithms so those are

133
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,240
the algorithms you you send it to a

134
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Quantum pipeline the classical tractable

135
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,560
ones you you you can simulate using

136
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,960
classical molecules sorry classical uh

137
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,520
computers and so again what we do is we

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,440
have further fragmentation techniques

139
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,039
which are quantum in nature that run on

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,120
a quantum computers and so once you do

141
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:05,120
that um you have like good answers for

142
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,240
the algorithm and so uh quickly the the

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,360
state of the field right now where

144
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,639
quantum computers are at the hardware

145
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,360
needs to catch up it's been making

146
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,120
tremendous progress over the F past five

147
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,520
years but it's still not there where it

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,000
can run uh these large calculations so

149
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,520
what we've come out with this Innovative

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,880
pipeline to use the current generation

151
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,759
hardware and run these simulations it's

152
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,440
sort of like if I got uh maybe instead

153
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,120
of 10,000 Nvidia gpus what if I had 1

154
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:43,680
million gpus right so but you only have

155
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,800
few thou 10 to 100,000 gpus so your

156
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,880
algorithm Innovation comes in place it's

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,680
the same idea our algorithm Innovation

158
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,360
enables you to use current generation of

159
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,599
hardware and to get the best answers and

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,560
this is where we're at and quickly we've

161
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:06,240
got our whole bunch of data which I'm

162
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,240
not sure it's going to make oops what

163
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,319
happened

164
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:19,240
oops there you go so here the major

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,680
place where you should pay attention to

166
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,680
is we reduce these numbers 27 10 ra to 9

167
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,120
to 10 what that means is the circuit

168
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,720
depth the amount of calculation you had

169
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,280
to do on a quantum computer went from 10

170
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,919
raised to per 9 to just 10 the number of

171
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,599
cubits you required for uh a certain

172
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,199
simulation went from 27 to uh just four

173
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,159
and this is sort of the Innovation we've

174
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,960
done over the past year that would

175
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,080
enable you to Target uh large molecules

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,400
and I'm happy to tell you much more

177
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,599
about uh all the achievements we've had

178
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,879
and similarly you can see the numbers

179
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,440
here you have 65,000 going to 2500 so

180
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,360
again uh I imagine like because these

181
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,919
may be foreign numbers to you but the

182
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,599
idea is we've had some really cool

183
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,039
couple of orders of magnitude

184
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,159
Improvement in algorithm development

185
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,599
where you can Target many of the complex

186
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:20,000
