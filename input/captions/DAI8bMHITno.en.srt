1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,000
okay so good morning

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,080
again

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:25,000
um lecture number

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,160
eight today we finally get to the

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,920
macroscopic world and models but let me

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,040
just remind you what we've done uh the

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,280
last topic we've we've seen the

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,000
chatelier brown Principle as a

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,840
consequence

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,600
of some interesting relations that uh

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,320
emerge from the fact that stability

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,600
conditions involve quadratic forms of

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,280
some of the fundamental of

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,320
the where the Matrix

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,120
is uh second second derivatives of the

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,439
fundamental relation or of some other

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,360
characteristic function like the Gibs

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,320
free

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:14,200
energy or the elol free energy and as a

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:20,280
result of U the mathematics of uh

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:22,000
putting a quadratic form in canonical uh

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,560
form we

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,240
obtain

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,799
uh

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,000
these

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,479
inequalities that we have also in

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,640
interpreted U

28
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,759
um in the sense uh of a the because

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,000
after all this is a

30
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,560
theorem we could call it the chatel

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,719
brown theorem there two two assertions

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,799
namely the fact that the system

33
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:54,479
responds to when you uh move it away

34
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,320
from where it is comfortable so when it

35
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,360
is in mutual equilibrium for example

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,479
with the with the

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,079
Reser and we have see that uh there are

38
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,039
different types of reservoirs with which

39
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,599
the system can be in mutual equilibrium

40
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,840
so uh the same idea apply for M

41
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,920
equilibrium with all those kinds of res

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,800
the idea is that the system if you do

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,480
something to it from the from outside uh

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,760
for example put in energy or put in uh

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:31,599
particles or uh change uh uh the

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,280
volume uh in

47
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,560
react the system

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,599
reacts

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,280
reacts

50
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,519
in try to go back to where it was

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,519
comfortable so it that's the first

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,680
assertion so if you put in energy it

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,840
will increase its temperature so that it

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,920
increases its willingness to give away

55
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:00,040
energy and return to uh equili with the

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,519
rest well uh but uh the second assertion

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,840
which is a consequence of

58
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,640
this additional Mass from the canonical

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,640
form of the quadratic

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:18,200
forms is that uh it depends the reaction

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,799
of the system depends on which direction

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,200
you take uh uh it away from equilibrium

63
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,799
and in particular if you break

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,519
conditions for Mutual

65
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,760
equilibrium so for example

66
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,000
if you have a

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,200
uh if the system can exchange volume

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,319
like in the example of the uh airs

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:48,959
Springs the system can exchange volume

70
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:51,159
and suppose that it is in uh in in a

71
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,640
mutual equilibrium also with a thermal

72
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,640
Reservoir so at the same

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,799
temperature so there are two

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,720
conditions for Mutual equilibrium

75
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,400
quality of pressure and quality of

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,360
temperature if you change the

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,480
volume while

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,640
breaking both conditions the system will

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,560
react

80
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,560
stronger uh than if you just turn break

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:27,000
one and that's that's the

82
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,560
idea and the difference is is is is

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,280
important for example in the case of the

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,280
uh

85
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,280
um

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,680
airspring the difference in the you get

87
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,960
the

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,840
reaction makes uh this volume act as a

89
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:50,000
as a standard spring but the constant

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,400
the spring constant depends on how many

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,639
conditions for a mutual equilibrium you

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,280
you've broken while changing that uh

93
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,759
volume and the change may be of the

94
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,800
order of I mean it's 40% if you do it

95
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,560
slowly so that uh uh the system has the

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,240
time to remain in the same

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,600
temperature so by exchanging energy with

98
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:21,960
the reservoir it remains in mutual

99
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:25,960
equilibrium then you get a a a milder

100
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,560
reaction than if you do it fast and if

101
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,759
you do it fast you change both the

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
pressure and the temperature and so the

103
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,160
system wants to has two reasons to go

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,360
back to

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,360
equilibrium okay so now we

106
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:48,600
finally to the question

107
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:52,440
uh well what's the difference between uh

108
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,680
microscopic systems and macroscopic

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,479
systems what is

110
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,919
um what do we gain if we make some

111
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,520
additional assumptions

112
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,520
that will involve having many

113
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:16,160
particles so let me start with a

114
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:17,599
few uh uh pictures but also even a more

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,280
simple

116
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,680
idea

117
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,919
so

118
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,199
because there are several ways in

119
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,680
which we can see the effect of what

120
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,440
happens when we have few particles for

121
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,120
example consider a single particle and

122
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,319
consider the most basic uh description

123
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,000
which is

124
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,120
one the quantum mechanics

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,720
description in quantum

126
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,720
mechanics uh you have uh that the

127
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,840
particle at

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,479
um is describ the position of the

129
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,599
particle is described by probability

130
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,479
density

131
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:09,319
function which tells you that uh

132
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,680
so it tells you what is the probability

133
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,960
to find for example the

134
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,840
particle when you make a position

135
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,520
experiment in this uh small interval

136
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,240
between X and X Plus

137
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,400
DX and in fact according to quantum

138
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,639
mechanics that all you can predict is

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,960
the

140
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,800
probability you cannot predict where the

141
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,400
particle will will will show up the next

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,479
time you call for where where are

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,560
you okay so essentially the

144
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,479
state in quantum mechanics is the

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,879
probability distribution or the set of

146
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,560
probability distributions that describe

147
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,879
that allow you to describe uh all all

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:08:00,080
these uh um uh all these measurement

149
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,080
acts but in a statistical sense

150
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,280
okay you see the important thing that I

151
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:08,800
want to emphasize uh uh today that is

152
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,440
important for our discussion today is

153
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,599
the fact that the you you find uh in

154
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,000
order to to solve in quantum mechanics

155
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:21,080
this problem you write the amilton of

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,560
your uh particle or system or particles

157
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,199
and you have to solve an igen value

158
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,960
problem to find the igen functions of

159
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:34,159
that uh uh am miltonian

160
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:38,200
and you have to face the boundary

161
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,200
conditions so the the walls of your

162
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,839
system

163
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:47,360
uh the things that we call ex external

164
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,480
forces are represented by an infinite

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:56,320
potential here on both

166
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:58,279
sides which forces the um functions to

167
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,720
go to

168
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,720
zero and at the

169
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,000
wall

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,000
okay then of course if you solve that I

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,480
value problem you find uh functions that

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,880
uh you can look it up uh in any uh

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Wikipedia page there is the various

174
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,760
Solutions and various iing functions and

175
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,600
then when you when the system is in a

176
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,079
stable equilibrium State uh um the

177
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,480
probability of all probability is is a

178
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,440
mixture of those

179
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,920
uh igen

180
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,600
functions for example here I took a

181
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,680
paper in

182
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,600
which uh there is a not one particle but

183
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:52,640
four particles Co finded in a box like

184
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
that and very low temperature now very

185
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,320
low

186
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,120
temperature that mixture of igen

187
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:05,360
functions make the uh the

188
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,360
um pan value ones uh

189
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,040
Prevail and you see here that so these

190
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,360
are the

191
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,560
distribution of particles of probability

192
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
to find the particles for various cases

193
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,040
going from a

194
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:29,279
boson black clim to a

195
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,279
fermion two things in between

196
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:39,040
the common feature that is important to

197
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:42,519
us is that uh at the wall those go to

198
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,040
zero so there is a that means the I

199
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,040
would call it raction

200
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,160
effect you can think of it as a gas a

201
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:55,399
probability

202
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,399
gas but it's rarified at the

203
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,240
walls here is another uh paper

204
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:09,160
um the review written by Professor Ali

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Constantino who is the uh mentor of this

206
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,920
class and uh in another realm this is

207
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,279
not really not quantum mechanics it's

208
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,560
molecular Dynamics the molecular

209
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,560
uh fluid

210
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,200
mechanics so there is a a solid wall

211
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,880
probably made of

212
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,880
carbon and

213
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,160
uh what what what what happens is that

214
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,880
the particles the interaction of the

215
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,760
particles due to Vander Val forces so

216
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
these are repulsive and attractive

217
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,959
forces like Leonard Jones and we will

218
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:58,440
talk U uh again about this but uh uh for

219
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:02,000
the moment I I presume that um you you

220
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:06,279
you have some ideas about that

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,480
uh due to this uh forces the and due to

222
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:13,440
the the fact that the wall is a fixed U

223
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,240
layer and it

224
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,560
imposes um the forces that do not move

225
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,000
whereas on the side of the bulk of the

226
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,199
fluid the particles move and so there is

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
more random action of forces the

228
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:33,720
ordering uh imposed by the wall

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,320
implies an ordering and layering of

230
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,839
particles at various distances there is

231
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,600
a first preferred distance and then

232
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,920
there is a second third and so on fading

233
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,880
out as the

234
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,959
randomness uh become more important away

235
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,720
from the

236
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:58,360
wall so this is also a sort of

237
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:02,519
um wall uh I would still call it raction

238
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,360
effect because yeah in very close to

239
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,160
between the first layer and the wall

240
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,440
there is nothing the particles don't

241
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,760
like to stay

242
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,959
there this in food mechanics has

243
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,199
importance because it it it has it's

244
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,320
related to the problem of the No Sleep

245
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:22,600
No Sleep condition if you're are fooding

246
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,880
mechanist when you have few particles

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,880
you have to deal with this problem and

248
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
uh

249
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,199
this is another

250
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,199
example

251
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,279
again watching

252
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,399
uh density

253
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:48,360
distributions of a

254
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,279
gas now here it's not few particles it's

255
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,560
like 10 to the

256
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:57,800
5ifth atoms it's not very

257
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:04,320
few still in these

258
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:08,279
cases you you see uh density wall

259
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,320
effects with uh R faction very near uh

260
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,800
the wall and then there are

261
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,160
Peaks uh where the particles like to

262
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,160
stay uh near the wall more than in the

263
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:27,160
B now 10 to the

264
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:27,160
f is not small but it's not large

265
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,279
okay so what is

266
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,360
uh why is this

267
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:49,000
important and so let's start with the

268
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,959
suppose I have two particles like

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,240
this

270
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,600
okay so I have a

271
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,680
wall but on the other

272
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,519
side I have a specular situation

273
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,759
in which I have another

274
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,399
particle in the same uh stable

275
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,199
equilibrium

276
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,120
State this is the meaning of this part

277
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,839
of the

278
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,759
figure think of just one particle on one

279
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,320
side in one particle on the other side

280
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:19,320
that's

281
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,480
okay now suppose

282
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:32,720
I find a way to make that wall that

283
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,720
separate the two particles

284
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,959
disappear

285
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,959
okay so the moment it

286
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,560
disappears particles don't know yet and

287
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,440
just just removed it they're still there

288
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,000
let's say oh hey there's more room

289
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,040
available there's more uh volume we can

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,279
f

291
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,040
so there will be a spontaneous

292
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:11,519
process whereby the particles will seal

293
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,160
that volume and eventually will reach a

294
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,440
new stable equilibrium

295
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,440
State let's

296
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,199
say something like

297
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:33,720
that if we look at it on uh

298
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,839
with the help of the E versus S diagram

299
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,920
which is very uh useful

300
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:43,519
here I have drawn

301
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,680
the E say um the stable equilibrium

302
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,000
State um curves fundamental

303
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,319
relation of the two

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,959
systems um that are that we have uh

305
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:57,680
considered one is the system in which

306
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,600
there is a partition that divides it

307
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,240
into two

308
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,160
the other is the system without the

309
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,000
partition and that system without the

310
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,400
partition for that one we are

311
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,919
considering two

312
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,679
states the state we started

313
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,240
with when when we just remove the par

314
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,799
it's a non equilibrium state so much

315
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
that we know that will

316
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:26,720
evolve towards the stable equilibrium

317
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,720
state so this point

318
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,840
here represents

319
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,240
for the system with the uh partition

320
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,799
system as the the initial stable

321
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,760
equilibrium

322
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:45,400
state but it also

323
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,440
represents the

324
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,320
state of the system without partition

325
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,160
and it's the non equilibrium state for

326
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:58,080
that system so here we call system a the

327
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,840
one without the partition and system uh

328
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,600
2 Lambda

329
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,799
I mean Lambda plus Lambda so it's two

330
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,640
Lambda um the system with the

331
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,520
partitions the reason I put I draw them

332
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:19,840
on uh this same spot meaning that they

333
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:23,480
have the same uh energy same

334
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,720
entropy is a consequence of the idea

335
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,760
that I have found a way to remove a

336
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:34,120
partition without perturbing the system

337
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,679
without putting in without any uh

338
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,159
uh

339
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,679
external

340
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:44,559
Exchange in no time so that essentially

341
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,520
I don't change any of the

342
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,520
properties ideally could do

343
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,480
it and the fact that I have put this

344
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,840
state to the left of the final stable

345
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,720
equilibrium state is that um yeah

346
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,240
intuitively we know that uh this the

347
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,120
particles will evolve in by filling the

348
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,120
entire space so that's the direction in

349
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:16,559
which the the the the system will evolve

350
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:20,440
not uh vice versa if I have put this

351
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:24,400
state on the other side it would mean

352
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:29,000
that the system would separate

353
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,000
spontaneously which doesn't happen

354
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,120
okay

355
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,200
okay

356
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,600
so the first consequence of this is that

357
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,720
uh the

358
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,320
entropy of the sa equilibrium

359
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,280
state of the two

360
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,840
particles that have the same energy

361
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,320
initial energy because this system is it

362
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,120
all happen happened in an isolated

363
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,320
system

364
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,640
uh the

365
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,480
entropy of the final stable equilibrium

366
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,280
state is greater than the initial

367
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,760
entropy of this state or also of this

368
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,039
donum

369
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,799
state that is by the principle of

370
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,720
entropy non decrease a spontaneous

371
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,960
process goes only in the direction of

372
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,400
increasing entropy for an isolated

373
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,200
system so what is uh that changes when

374
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,640
you have uh uh

375
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,640
many

376
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,960
particles somehow I have already used

377
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,840
this idea here uh when you have many

378
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,600
particles because here I go from one to

379
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,679
two

380
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,400
particles the slope of this probability

381
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,320
distribution at the wall becomes steeper

382
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
so in other words uh the more particles

383
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,360
you

384
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,720
have the smaller

385
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,480
is the

386
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,480
raction layer next to the

387
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,000
wall and as a

388
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,799
result you see uh

389
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,400
here you see the difference with

390
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,840
it could say what it could use

391
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:52,039
stes yeah they're

392
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,039
remarkable but just

393
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,960
be So eventually you

394
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:04,760
have almost flat distribution in the

395
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,760
bulk of your system and a

396
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:12,640
sharp very thin already we call it

397
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:16,679
boundary layer or wall layer rtion

398
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,080
layer so even at the center this region

399
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,080
is very

400
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,559
small that

401
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,520
means that the two stable equilibrium

402
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:31,880
State

403
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,880
curves get closer to one

404
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,840
in and in the limit of many particles

405
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,080
you can

406
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,480
neglect this difference so you can

407
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,720
neglect this fact you

408
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,840
can

409
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,320
approximate the properties of the system

410
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,480
with the part

411
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,000
partitions with the properties of the

412
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:00,440
system without the partition or you are

413
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,720
interested you can mod the system

414
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,559
without the partition as if it it had

415
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,919
the

416
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,880
partition these are very important when

417
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,840
we this when we

418
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,480
go here

419
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,120
might is very important that happens

420
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,760
that

421
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,039
yes you have

422
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:31,559
a box or I

423
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:36,080
for ever you C and

424
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:39,600
you uh those

425
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,600
elements that are

426
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:48,480
small world enough

427
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:53,080
many M respect to the

428
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,080
system but not

429
00:23:53,559 --> 00:24:00,159
more this of need we question

430
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,840
return

431
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:16,440
to M saying is that when I consider see

432
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:25,200
like here I am going to

433
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,200
apply models like the local could build

434
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,760
mother and with this in uh the

435
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,840
properties of a system in which the

436
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,679
particles are

437
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:44,159
those by physical

438
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,159
words the

439
00:24:51,559 --> 00:25:00,120
approximate

440
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:03,679
is how do you do that how insert

441
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:08,000
tiue we mention on make as more mention

442
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,080
on MAR they system

443
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,520
side

444
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:18,480
stud when there temperature press ener

445
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:23,039
one okay and then I ass sign I say when

446
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,039
the properties of this are the same as

447
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:33,440
that forgetting about W's effect

448
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,440
with this idea on physically

449
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,559
inserting doesn't that change the

450
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,960
properties of system is fundamental in

451
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,880
our

452
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,440
industry

453
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,440
Contin at at the microscopic

454
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,520
level

455
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,640
okay by in principle we should know that

456
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:05,120
if you

457
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:07,720
it and replex we

458
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,399
land good two

459
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,159
F then it will make me in trouble

460
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,600
playing you

461
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,600
get and so

462
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:27,679
you're your assumption that music May

463
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:29,440
which involes local equilibrium you the

464
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,760
my

465
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,000
also should they care about the many

466
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,000
parles of

467
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,559
Fus all right so let's see what we

468
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,960
gain in the many particles and we go

469
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,960
back

470
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,840
to

471
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:00,840
all with imp partition let's see what we

472
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,919
gain but here here's a more uh schematic

473
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,000
um

474
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,120
idea so suppose we have our system a is

475
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,279
this one where we have

476
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,799
uh whatever

477
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:18,000
particles a given volume volume here is

478
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:23,039
important because of course you be it

479
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,480
has to be uh be able to fin

480
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,720
system

481
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,720
also you see

482
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,760
when we are in this

483
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,200
nit since there are faction effects

484
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:45,039
become an importance to as the

485
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:49,559
boundary essentially the geometry of

486
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:54,559
your uh container loses

487
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:57,360
import for example here where in this um

488
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,320
this picture here shows very well the

489
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,000
geometry of your

490
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,679
container does play a big

491
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,399
role so if you have if you go to this

492
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,840
paper there are other geometries that

493
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:16,559
are shown nice pictures uh you see that

494
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,640
the W far because layer out layer this

495
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,159
work layer there

496
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,240
Wars depends of course on the shape of

497
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:27,320
the contain and therefore the

498
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,080
properties of stable equilibrium depend

499
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,440
on the shape

500
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,720
but in the limit in which

501
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,720
those attack W effects become

502
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,720
important

503
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,799
you only the overall volume of the

504
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,159
container what the details import

505
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,399
are because in The

506
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,240
Bu

507
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:58,919
The the that's

508
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,919
uniform it's uniform everywhere

509
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:07,279
okay so here suppose we we have our

510
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:10,279
system and suppose we partition it into

511
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,279
Lambda

512
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,679
partitions here we call it Lambda later

513
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,679
we call it

514
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:29,559
n so that means that

515
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,559
on this side this is a composite system

516
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,799
uh it's still in stable equilibrium

517
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,760
State each one is in a stable

518
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:39,279
equilibrium State like this is the sty

519
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,279
system we started on here in the

520
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,720
blackb uh and they and we assume that we

521
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,200
have a

522
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,880
partition way that not only the volume

523
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:56,720
but also number of particles is exactly

524
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,720
uh one / Lambda the overall the volume

525
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,279
is one / Lambda overall and the energy

526
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,279
of one of

527
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:08,559
around all right

528
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:12,120
so now remember what the fundamental

529
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,320
relation means for example here

530
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,880
fundamental relation means that it gives

531
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,159
us the properties of of all the stable

532
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,760
equilibrium

533
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,399
States uh as a function of energy volume

534
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,320
and their amount so it is

535
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,679
valid it is a function the same

536
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,720
functional for

537
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:35,840
form maybe e s the B Cub the log of n

538
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,000
things like that it's the same function

539
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,000
uh for

540
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
all

541
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,200
values EV

542
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:51,200
andn I can compute it also for e but

543
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,799
also for E over Lambda the same

544
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:59,200
function is if is the

545
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,200
same mixture of substances for example

546
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,000
for uh lot of energy or small energy

547
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,440
large volume small volume many particles

548
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,440
two

549
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,760
but as long as this F doesn't get two

550
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,120
fuel it's

551
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:24,240
okay I mean it's okay what we're going

552
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,240
to say so at this stage it's okay in

553
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:29,919
general but what we said here is that uh

554
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,919
this

555
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,600
curves this is the partition curve it's

556
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,440
the summ it's this side so it's this

557
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,120
much for each subsystem so if you have

558
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,600
Lambda of those you multiply it by

559
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,639
Lambda Lambda times s because s is an

560
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,480
additive property so you can the entropy

561
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:54,399
of the overall is the sum of the

562
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:57,440
entropies of the parts and uh

563
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,880
so this composite system is an entropy

564
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,880
Lambda

565
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:07,760
s and this s s s sub

566
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:11,000
Lambda whereas system a is an entropy

567
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,000
ASO in

568
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,240
general this as bigger entropy than that

569
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,559
but in the limit of many

570
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,120
particles this difference becomes un

571
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:29,840
important and so we can

572
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,840
approximate um that uh the two are equal

573
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,720
that's one we call the simple system

574
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,240
model

575
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:44,000
uh you don't find it around with this

576
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,960
name except in in our book perhaps the

577
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,760
choice of the name wasn't

578
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,159
um

579
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:58,039
the what it uh but it expresses what

580
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,320
what uh you find under the title of

581
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:03,600
thermodynamic

582
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,960
linit in physics so that's how it's call

583
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,960
this

584
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,519
idea I need it is a limit because now

585
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:20,279
what look what we're going to

586
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,240
do we here we s we choose a finite value

587
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,120
for Lambda so we partition the system in

588
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,159
a finite number of

589
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,840
partition and it has to be finite in

590
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,960
order for the number of particles inside

591
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,960
each to become not too

592
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
small

593
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:45,320
yet if Lambda can

594
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,320
be large

595
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:58,440
enough 10 to the 23 and is that Lambda

596
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:03,200
could be say a millium

597
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:06,120
and uh still in each uh uh partition you

598
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:11,159
have 10 today what

599
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:15,280
17 so that means uh still a lot of

600
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,320
vles so um from the Practical point of

601
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,919
view when you have so many particles you

602
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,320
can um think that this

603
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:28,960
Lambda can be any any

604
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,679
number oh yes could be in

605
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,440
but who cares between the integers there

606
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,679
are the reals so let's just make it real

607
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,480
he so

608
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:45,040
um so you make this mathematical

609
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,800
assumption essentially take this this

610
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:52,200
formula

611
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:56,960
here and uh make it valid make it as a

612
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,640
valid for any Lambda integer or real

613
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,640
doesn't move

614
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,880
so you formally assume that the

615
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,960
fundamental relation has this

616
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,440
property and this property for a

617
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,160
function in mathematics it's called the

618
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,160
homogeneity of first

619
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,960
degree the fundamental relation is a

620
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,280
homogeneous function of first degree in

621
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,640
all of

622
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,640
its uh independent variables

623
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:38,480
divide each one by any but the same

624
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,640
Lambda then multiply the result by

625
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:48,599
Lambda you get uh uh the value of the

626
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,839
function for the original uh values of

627
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,520
independent

628
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,599
properties and this is is an important

629
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,359
uh Assumption of course it's a heavy

630
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:01,640
assumption

631
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:05,319
which has this physics for us to support

632
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,319
it and when you do

633
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:14,800
it we gain one relation we're going to

634
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:17,079
prove it in a moment which is called the

635
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,240
oiler

636
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,760
relation and notice

637
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:27,720
also I changed the

638
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,880
letter for um energy from E to U

639
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,400
and we also going to call it internal

640
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,400
energy or this

641
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:40,400
station so soon as we say internal

642
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:43,440
energy we say aha okay we are within the

643
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,440
simple system model

644
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,640
approximate all right so how do we prove

645
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:58,359
uh that

646
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:04,920
relation well it's simple uh one

647
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:06,680
way is since is has to be true for all

648
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,000
lambdas

649
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,000
take the

650
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:18,240
partial derivative of this with respect

651
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,240
to Lambda

652
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,000
now is it uh yeah okay there's I think

653
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,000
there's something

654
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,960
there something fish itting this

655
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:54,280
that there there's something fishing is

656
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:57,000
the m something missing sorry about that

657
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,160
but uh okay so when you take the partial

658
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,640
derivative with respect to Lambda of

659
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,520
this thing you get

660
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,400
U because of this Lambda

661
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,480
here and then and then you have to St

662
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,560
you have Lambda that

663
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,839
multiplies uh the derivative of you

664
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,640
respect to S times the derivative of s

665
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,040
of this with respect to Lambda so it's

666
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:26,599
minus one over Lambda squ and so so yeah

667
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:28,640
this is um uh um wrong U graph sorry

668
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,880
I'll correct it

669
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,240
um and then in the end of this this

670
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,599
derivative you take Lambda equals one

671
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,319
and here comes his

672
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:44,720
ration this matter is better done in the

673
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:44,720
book than in this few graph

674
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:53,319
sorry okay and what is another uh

675
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,280
consequence hope this P are okay now uh

676
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:59,440
this is another uh the the main

677
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,440
consequence of the oil

678
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:09,160
relation is that

679
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,760
um we can Define it makes sense to

680
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,640
define

681
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:20,160
specific properties for example I have

682
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:24,079
the energy I'm not going put it e i call

683
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,079
U and suppose I

684
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,040
am in fact

685
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,040
then is the sound or all

686
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,560
the

687
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,560
remember so this

688
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,240
prob

689
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,160
specific uh

690
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,720
molar

691
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,839
enery I do the same

692
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,920
or

693
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,319
theit of the

694
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:10,319
volume and for the

695
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:16,240
amounts well the amount of substance I

696
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:16,240
I is piap the motor action of

697
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,000
the

698
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
okay

699
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:28,240
so now I'm going to

700
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:32,640
express I want to see how

701
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:36,000
the specific molar

702
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:41,839
energy that is that represent so much

703
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:45,520
energy I have with you number of all

704
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:50,079
five instead of and

705
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,880
I to the denominator the M mass that

706
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,480
will be the

707
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:01,160
speci en with mass a enery hand so

708
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,160
kilogram of

709
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:10,079
substance

710
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:14,400
say so from the

711
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:19,359
definition and of U so U uh is a

712
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:21,640
function of SV andn but s can be

713
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:27,319
written

714
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:30,720
here more less the CTIC Banks the amount

715
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:33,640
n * s and

716
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,200
so volume so the volume can be written

717
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:42,720
as n * uh lower case z and the amounts

718
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,720
can be written as the N times the more

719
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:50,359
fractions so if I look at this

720
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,000
expression here I see it uh

721
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:56,800
that the specific

722
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,240
energy does depend on the specific

723
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,200
entropy B specific volume the mole

724
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,920
fraction but it also depend on N because

725
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,040
the N

726
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,040
appears all in several places

727
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,040
here

728
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:20,839
right so that means for example

729
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:23,920
the kilog give an amount of

730
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:26,760
substance that has a certain

731
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,559
energy uh a certain specific energy but

732
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,559
if I have 2

733
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,240
kilog the energy per

734
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,240
kilogram may not be the same if it

735
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:42,000
depends on

736
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:45,000
it it's like here I

737
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
have

738
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:59,960
water is to go

739
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,280
they have brought

740
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:06,640
this the not staying

741
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,640
that with the

742
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,240
same

743
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,200
away so for small systems this

744
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,160
dependence on N is there and it is

745
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,119
represented by a fundamental relation

746
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,480
that's uh so you need you need to

747
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:28,440
measure

748
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,920
it for most systems you have to

749
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,160
measure it's not enough to measure the

750
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,920
unit of a substance like one kilogram so

751
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,319
you measure the proper of water called

752
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,119
the mod uh you measure one kilogram and

753
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:44,200
you have done because when you have two

754
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,040
kilogram you just multiply by two that's

755
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:52,520
good in the microscopic them but when

756
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:57,520
you have uh BL mudes of

757
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:59,800
water it's not just wise

758
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,119
the properties of 100

759
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:06,079
point you have to see how it depends how

760
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:10,640
those properties depend also on the

761
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,640
amount but in the limit of many

762
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,280
particles that dependence vanishes so

763
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,280
this proof which takes again the partial

764
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,640
derivative of U with respect to n so you

765
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:28,079
want to see how much is

766
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,079
it well that dependence

767
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,200
is

768
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,880
equal to if you do the derivatives and

769
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:41,319
let you uh do it

770
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:44,960
uh uh it's minus 1 / n s

771
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:48,640
times you remember the what what was

772
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,640
this we should add

773
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,160
there

774
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,880
allistic

775
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,880
F that term in parenthesis is what we

776
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,200
call the

777
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,200
oil what you what we say is

778
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,240
that the the way the specific

779
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:13,240
canery of the system at sa equilibrium

780
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,240
depends all the number of

781
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,839
FS is measured by

782
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:31,119
o but in the limit as and God

783
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:34,160
see what system goes to

784
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,079
Z because the O

785
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,920
relation just

786
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:42,400
says that this is equal to

787
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,319
zero that that relation here or what we

788
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,400
call

789
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:51,720
O is equivalent to saying only

790
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,720
characteristic f

791
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,119
equals so that's what we

792
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,800
gain we gain what one more

793
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,680
relation and you know you would think

794
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,559
already so many things from just

795
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,079
watching fundamental now we have another

796
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:15,960
one you can imagine that you can

797
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:20,040
extract uh additional information for

798
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:24,960
example one way which is now equivalent

799
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,960
with the ear relation is to take its

800
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,319
differential and subract from it the GS

801
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,079
relation which is the differential of

802
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:39,000
this the fundamental relation the result

803
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:41,079
is called DS new M relation and it is

804
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,200
this

805
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:49,160
one so relation between in which see the

806
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:52,160
independent

807
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:55,240
um differentials are temperature

808
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,839
pressure and uh the chemical potentials

809
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,839
so these are the

810
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,079
that a conditions for a visual

811
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,760
equ okay

812
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,319
once we have this

813
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,480
idea we can

814
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:41,880
also uh proceed with defining a um

815
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,440
another kind of interaction which is the

816
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,480
B flow

817
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,480
interaction uh dang

818
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:57,240
it idea and now that a system many

819
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,680
the I have that

820
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,720
but in

821
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:05,400
that I can consider a c

822
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:09,119
element and I can assign to it P as

823
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:13,640
it separated by

824
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:16,400
walls so right instead of doing it um

825
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:20,240
and like a cube by consider a steer but

826
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,400
that's the same idea so suppose that

827
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:27,480
locally I

828
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,800
would and um and it is

829
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,800
in

830
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:35,400
St this

831
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,559
box is say

832
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:54,720
what now

833
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,720
it's look at

834
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:04,880
different

835
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:09,160
reference exle why that

836
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:12,200
Wes I look at it from the

837
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:16,799
reference it goes the other

838
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,799
way app a veloc

839
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:25,680
to and associated with that

840
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,680
velocity a kinetic energy

841
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:34,319
in addition if I look at it from an

842
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,040
accelerated reference

843
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:40,079
plan then uh that has the same

844
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,079
acceleration as the

845
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,079
gram

846
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:56,280
G then it acquires also the

847
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:56,280
tension is to can

848
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,960
so the idea is is this okay now

849
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:07,640
including

850
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:10,839
mechanics see them actions in which IUS

851
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,240
cross the boundary between two systems

852
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,240
there is

853
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:20,440
movement choose as reference way and

854
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,680
that's of the boundary where the partic

855
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,680
are

856
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,760
crossing then the it

857
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,760
but for each of these particle I can

858
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,480
always find the reference frame in which

859
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,480
it is not

860
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,200
moving and even if it is in presence of

861
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:46,079
a gravitational field for each of these

862
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:49,520
part can find an accelerated frame uh

863
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:53,200
where it is uh

864
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,960
not we that we inspect those frines

865
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,200
there is no kinetic energy and no

866
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,799
potential energy

867
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,760
so somehow this kinetic energy and

868
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:06,359
potential energy has effect that can be

869
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,799
added or or removed by just changing the

870
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,799
reference

871
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,799
way clearly that doesn't change internal

872
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,920
properties of the

873
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:21,720
stuff it doesn't change the energy I

874
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,200
mean yes it does change the the the

875
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:28,559
energy but it doesn't change uh the

876
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,559
other part because um like

877
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,640
so this is uh the model that we make

878
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:40,520
that we call Bulk Flow State bu flow

879
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,520
local equid in

880
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:48,520
Spate we

881
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:52,359
assign the good elements the Frog of the

882
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,359
lock they would have believe

883
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,240
them or we assume that the summer

884
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:03,079
reference respect to which it

885
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,079
is media

886
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:24,280
and that thing uh that energy which

887
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:28,520
satisfies the fundamental relation of

888
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,520
St in that sense

889
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:38,079
it is enure it has a

890
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,079
pord it has L of fum

891
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:49,079
varation so that's step

892
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:50,599
one defines a local

893
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:54,280
equilibrium

894
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:57,160
model step two is that if you have a

895
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,440
boundary between two systems for example

896
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:03,720
you have a pipe that brings uh fluid

897
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,720
elements inside your

898
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:11,319
system but we usually how do we this is

899
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:15,200
an open system put it an open

900
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:15,200
system and

901
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,799
uh we usually

902
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,960
represent

903
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:26,920
uh as a

904
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,920
boundary the formal boundary as a imagin

905
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,799
uh it's now in our mind there is a

906
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,480
boundary between the pipe and the

907
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:37,160
system but this boundary isn't

908
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:41,079
physical

909
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,799
yet in order to model the interaction we

910
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,760
suppose it is physical suppose we can

911
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:47,880
put a physical

912
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,240
partition which we are allowed because

913
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,240
we are really in a simple system

914
00:53:52,760 --> 00:54:01,640
model so let me put

915
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:08,160
uh in a Time instant uh

916
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:08,160
t let me put a um a partition that

917
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:16,720
separates that amount of fluid that uh

918
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:20,480
is going to cross this boundary in the

919
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:25,920
next time interval delta T or

920
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:29,440
DT so now it's here later is there and

921
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,440
it's phys Al separated

922
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,680
by if a no cost I have put in

923
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:48,880
that okay then what happens uh if I look

924
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:52,040
at the from the the fluid element the

925
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,119
fluid parcel that is coming uh that is

926
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:58,720
crossing here uh from a reference frame

927
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:01,040
that moves at with its velocity I am

928
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:05,359
assuming for Simplicity here that there

929
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,359
is a flat velocity of

930
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,119
P or it's

931
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:14,280
not make

932
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,920
it single out velocity

933
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,920
profile but for Simplicity let's suppose

934
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:23,520
we look at just one element and so that

935
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,319
as it's velocity and look at it from the

936
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:30,160
rest reference

937
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:30,160
frame when which you see it as not

938
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,160
moving

939
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,920
okay

940
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:42,359
this partition that you put in is a

941
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,359
partition that separates two

942
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:50,680
systems that are in uh Mutual

943
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,240
equilibrium they have the same pressure

944
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,960
in

945
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,240
temperature particular particular the

946
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,319
pressure is the same that

947
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,720
partition uh even it could move it

948
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,240
wouldn't move because all the fluids

949
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,280
that are coming in in the pipe here have

950
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,280
the same uh

951
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
pressure

952
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:18,920
but if you now make uh the energy

953
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,799
balance and here is the details of

954
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:25,760
making the energy balance for uh this

955
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:30,920
composite system of the system which is

956
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,920
receiving that amount of fluid

957
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:37,280
plus this fluid that will eventually get

958
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:44,000
in so now that we have separated it with

959
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:47,839
a physical partition this partition

960
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,760
makes it uh a legitimate system so the

961
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:56,039
the composite system a plus b Prime is

962
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:58,960
uh well separated from the rest because

963
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:03,119
it as a wall and it always satisfied our

964
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,839
definition of system in which uh we get

965
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:10,079
external forces with certain

966
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:13,000
kind okay so for these kind of systems

967
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:16,760
which are closed system now we can we we

968
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,680
have already introduced uh the energy

969
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:23,960
balance do the energy

970
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:26,200
balance which involves saying that the

971
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,799
final energy minus the initial energy is

972
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:33,200
is equal to the energy exchanged via

973
00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:35,920
interactions and here there is only one

974
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,039
interaction it's the the fact that there

975
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,520
is a

976
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:43,359
pressure acting on a moving

977
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:45,599
piston moving

978
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:48,880
Bounder and

979
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:52,520
that and that is a

980
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,520
work but this is the

981
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:01,280
work he that means that now we play

982
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:09,000
additivity in the final State we note

983
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,720
that in system B

984
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,720
Prime there is nothing

985
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:20,400
left the system B Prime is now between

986
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:20,400
this fixed boundary and the moving

987
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:29,400
boundary if you

988
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:31,680
want a we we could say that I to be more

989
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,319
precise I should say that at initial

990
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,559
time at time

991
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:40,319
T in order for system B Prime to be a

992
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:43,359
system I have to have introduced

993
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,359
physical boundary

994
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:54,680
here then I remove it I let things uh go

995
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:56,839
and in the end I reput again uh the

996
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,119
physical bound right here but there is

997
00:58:56,839 --> 00:59:02,880
nothing between the two boundaries so

998
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,880
the energy entropy there are

999
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:10,559
zero and again in order to do the the um

1000
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,559
adding or removing partitions I need to

1001
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,559
I need to be within the simple system

1002
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:23,720
model okay so to make the long uh story

1003
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,880
shorter here is the uh the expression

1004
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,640
for the

1005
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:31,119
war and is uh pressure times

1006
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,079
uh the

1007
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:37,200
area times the

1008
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:41,000
displacement and uh you can show that it

1009
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:45,280
is proportional to the specific volume

1010
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:50,039
times the pressure times the amount of

1011
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:52,720
the the fluid parcel that has been

1012
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:55,280
exchanged and in the end of the story

1013
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,480
you see that uh this work which we

1014
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:02,640
usually call the the pulsion

1015
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:06,359
work uh add a contribution to the

1016
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:11,599
energy that is brought into system a

1017
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:14,599
it's not only the internal energy of of

1018
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:17,960
of fluid not only its kinetic energy and

1019
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:22,119
and potential energy but also this

1020
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:26,079
passion work and that is why in a b flow

1021
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:27,480
interaction the it's you

1022
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,640
energy plus

1023
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,160
PV which if we recall it's called

1024
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,400
corresponds to definition of that

1025
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:40,680
characteristic function that we call the

1026
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:44,680
B and that enters into uh the expression

1027
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,680
that says how much energy is

1028
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,799
transferred in this kind of

1029
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:53,039
interaction of course you can do the

1030
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:57,079
same when the parcel is is going from

1031
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,079
inside to outside

1032
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,280
and therefore we get this

1033
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,799
um summary of defining properties for

1034
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,079
the B

1035
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:15,760
flow interaction it

1036
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,760
contributes Mass to the

1037
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:22,119
system by by the mass balance you can

1038
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,559
write it this

1039
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:29,400
way energy here is the inal and also

1040
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:34,559
entropy the entropy is just the entropy

1041
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:39,640
that uh uh fluid element has and S we

1042
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:42,640
uh translate from outside to

1043
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,640
inside

1044
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:57,839
translates okay in out you can also do

1045
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:01,200
this per unit time

1046
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,200
and uh you can

1047
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:07,480
uh

1048
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:11,920
therefore now with this additional type

1049
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:14,720
of interaction you can write

1050
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,760
uh balance equations for a system that

1051
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,760
is

1052
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:22,000
sub all sorts of interactions for

1053
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:26,599
example here we have right heat

1054
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,720
temperature ta typically we use the a or

1055
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:30,760
the letter zero for the

1056
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,720
environmental

1057
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:36,000
conditions here we have a heat

1058
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,520
interaction at some other

1059
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,039
temperature

1060
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,680
maybe

1061
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:43,680
cold uh this one at another

1062
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:49,520
temperature we may have work

1063
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:52,319
interactions of various types like a

1064
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,720
shaft bringing in uh mechanical

1065
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:57,279
energy electrical wires beinging

1066
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,799
bringing in ccal energy these are all

1067
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:03,119
work

1068
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:06,920
equivalent or a moving uh boundary

1069
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:09,039
against the pressure of the atmosphere

1070
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:13,359
that is also work in

1071
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:17,359
there and plus we have we may have

1072
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:19,079
many bulk flow interactions and as we

1073
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,960
have seen in order to characterize a

1074
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:23,720
bulk

1075
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,000
flow uh interaction we need to

1076
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,200
characterize the blood flow States of

1077
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,720
the fluid elements that are carried in

1078
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:34,680
and out so you need the enthalpy the

1079
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:37,279
local enthalpy uh the the local

1080
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,319
entropy the velocity of the fluid

1081
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:41,079
elements and the local height in the

1082
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:44,920
gravitational Feld so that you can

1083
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:44,920
compute the uh

1084
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:54,279
potential of course subject to all these

1085
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:57,720
interactions is going to be

1086
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:57,720
uh so

1087
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:05,640
it's not going to be easy to balance

1088
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:07,400
them so that you keep the energy the

1089
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,039
same the enthropy the same the volume

1090
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:13,319
the same the the mass the same which

1091
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:15,920
would be required to keep the system in

1092
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:15,920
a steady

1093
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:22,920
state but uh very often that's exactly

1094
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:26,160
what you do for example this is a power

1095
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:29,119
plant and you want to operate it in such

1096
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,119
a way that it doesn't consume itself it

1097
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:35,119
simply processes stuff so you need to

1098
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:39,880
balance what goes in with what goes

1099
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:42,559
out and while you do that U

1100
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:45,799
definitely most of the times produce

1101
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:51,000
entropy by IR

1102
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:54,880
reversible this a balance equation of

1103
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,760
mass rate of change of the mass is a met

1104
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,480
uh uh

1105
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:03,039
mass flow rates that are that go in and

1106
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:06,440
out here I to simplify the notation I

1107
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:10,640
consider m dot with the

1108
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:12,920
arrow just in so it's positive is in

1109
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:16,279
that means that if I want to

1110
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:18,799
represent something go going out it I

1111
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:21,279
will need the

1112
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,960
negative or you you could split this

1113
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:26,799
summation into two

1114
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:30,079
sums and put on one

1115
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:32,680
the mass the masses that go in and minus

1116
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,839
the summation of the masses that go out

1117
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,400
that's also this for the energy the rate

1118
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:41,920
of change of the energy is equal to the

1119
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:45,520
net amount of energy transferred by

1120
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,720
interactions here are the Heats works

1121
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:50,240
here are the B

1122
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:52,680
fros and for the entropy the rate of

1123
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:57,039
change of the entropy of the

1124
01:05:52,680 --> 01:06:00,559
system is first term here is the entr ex

1125
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:04,799
changed either via the buf flow

1126
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,799
interactions or via the

1127
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:08,760
Heats and then

1128
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:18,760
that what how about this

1129
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:21,279
sign what do you think that's an arrow

1130
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,880
okay the entropy plus the entropy

1131
01:06:21,279 --> 01:06:23,880
produced by

1132
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,160
IRB that needs to be

1133
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:31,720
corrected just

1134
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,960
uh I probably left it

1135
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:37,079
there to

1136
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:40,440
see if I'm awake enough and you are

1137
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:42,880
awake enough to spot it and

1138
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,559
but so we with

1139
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:49,039
did and once we

1140
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:52,920
have this balance equations we can

1141
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,920
manipulate them solve

1142
01:06:53,319 --> 01:07:01,520
problems in

1143
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,520
the large uh

1144
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:08,520
community of uh the engineers that have

1145
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:13,160
uh played with these

1146
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:19,599
equations there developed this idea of

1147
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:19,599
exergy and exergy Analysis ofg

1148
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:31,720
systems um it it adds nothing to this

1149
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:33,279
equations except um perhaps it helps in

1150
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,920
reading

1151
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:39,240
them it adds nothing because it simply

1152
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,960
it is based on a linear combination of

1153
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:45,039
these equations the mathematically all

1154
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,880
the information was contained in here

1155
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,319
but this is the basic we definitely need

1156
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,799
to make an energy balance and an entropy

1157
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:54,319
balance if you don't like working with

1158
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:56,520
enthropy and we refer to work with a

1159
01:07:54,319 --> 01:08:01,279
linear combination of energ and

1160
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:05,039
entropy fine then you call it XG balance

1161
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:08,599
and so one way to combine these

1162
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:10,760
equations is to take one of these forms

1163
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:12,960
uh that

1164
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:16,400
um is

1165
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:21,480
to take the second equation the entropy

1166
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,480
equation multiply by some

1167
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:26,520
temperature and it is convenient to

1168
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:31,520
choose

1169
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:33,960
the temperature of one of your um heat

1170
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:37,040
interaction and is even more convenient

1171
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:41,319
to choose the temperature of the heat

1172
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:43,839
interaction that is considered free of

1173
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:47,400
charge for example if you if your

1174
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:52,400
Machinery operates in some in an

1175
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:55,880
environment like uh the air your air

1176
01:08:52,400 --> 01:09:00,960
conditioning at home works in the air

1177
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:03,799
and uses uh and dumps heat in the

1178
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:06,000
environment you would I would use that

1179
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:09,319
temperature uh

1180
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,759
is the temperature that I use in this

1181
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:13,679
linear

1182
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:17,560
combination If instead your power plant

1183
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:20,400
is cooled by the water of of the

1184
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,520
R I would I would use the temperature of

1185
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,520
the

1186
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:31,279
rib in any case so take that multiply

1187
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,279
and then subtract it from the energy

1188
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:41,839
balance and uh if

1189
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:47,279
you yeah I think here

1190
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:47,279
also you have to be a little

1191
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:54,760
uh I should have been a little more

1192
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:56,040
careful in uh making explicitly the work

1193
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:59,400
uh

1194
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:02,400
uh write it write separately the work

1195
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:06,840
related to the P times uh rate of change

1196
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:10,800
of Dr like the PV PA times times rate of

1197
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:13,760
change of volume should be um singled

1198
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,640
out here maybe I'll do it

1199
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:20,360
uh later on the slides just for the

1200
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,800
slides and uh when I correct also the

1201
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:26,000
minus sign

1202
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:29,199
here so that

1203
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:35,159
that work term can go on this side of

1204
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:35,159
the equation and make this PA times

1205
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:44,159
DB all right so here is

1206
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:50,360
a an xfg balance equation and

1207
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:55,400
xfg is

1208
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:57,960
a is a topic that we need to discuss uh

1209
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:01,320
uh we not make uh the story very long

1210
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:06,199
but uh it's it's part of theody dnamic

1211
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:08,719
so it it is uh a good idea to discuss it

1212
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:13,120
also because it brings a several useful

1213
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:17,960
ideas about how to define efficiences of

1214
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:20,159
U energy conversion devices and so it is

1215
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:25,760
uh important in

1216
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:25,760
the the mechanical engineering the fact

1217
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:36,440
we will um we will see okay we already

1218
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:39,040
have seen that combinations like that I

1219
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:42,000
think we use the letter c Capital Fe to

1220
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:48,080
represent his uh um availability

1221
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,080
function e minus t r s plus P

1222
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:53,320
RV so this says that's the rate of

1223
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:56,440
change of the

1224
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:59,400
availability but X and availability are

1225
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,840
the same idea same concept the words for

1226
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,840
the same

1227
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,840
idea

1228
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:09,960
uh heat

1229
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:13,320
times Caro

1230
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:16,800
coefficient uh and the cono coefficient

1231
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:20,440
is um between temperature of what I've

1232
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,440
chosen as my

1233
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,280
um and

1234
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,040
environment and the temperature at which

1235
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:32,159
the heat is

1236
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:36,120
exchanged this

1237
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:38,639
represents for a given Caro engine the

1238
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:41,960
maximum work that you could extract by

1239
01:12:38,639 --> 01:12:44,480
exploiting less heat interaction having

1240
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:49,280
available uh environment of temperature

1241
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:52,880
T not and so this is the the exergy

1242
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:55,880
associated with that heat interaction it

1243
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,880
can

1244
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:03,199
work appears directly not multiplied not

1245
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:06,639
corrected because work is already

1246
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:08,360
available to uh let's say if you have

1247
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:11,159
some work you can do useful things

1248
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:15,639
directly you don't have to convert the

1249
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:18,320
work is already in a sense

1250
01:13:15,639 --> 01:13:21,560
ex because the word

1251
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:25,120
exy really

1252
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:28,120
means the the essential part of the end

1253
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:35,360
energy so the the the the use

1254
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:35,360
for fractal the energy that it's

1255
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:42,120
either within your

1256
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:44,760
system or an energy

1257
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:48,400
transferred so the concept applies both

1258
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:53,080
for the addictive properties on of the

1259
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:56,480
system energy East or the uh modes of

1260
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,480
energy transfer

1261
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:03,760
it

1262
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:07,800
work and here is also the XG expression

1263
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,800
or uh about flow

1264
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:15,239
interactions and out of this um do the

1265
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:19,560
proper sign here you get a minus and

1266
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:23,360
here is correct minus t * s dot

1267
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:29,080
reversible this is the

1268
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:33,960
in uh dissipation the terms that

1269
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:33,960
represents the destruction of bra

1270
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:43,120
ex and like um entropy cannot be cannot

1271
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,440
can cannot be

1272
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,040
destroyed

1273
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,679
uh

1274
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:55,880
exergy cannot be

1275
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:55,880
created you canot it uh destroyed

1276
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,159
so they related so

1277
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:04,880
reversibility you do things

1278
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:07,239
reversibly you don't create entropy and

1279
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,520
you don't destroy

1280
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:12,159
exergy you do things

1281
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,719
irreversibly you create entropy and

1282
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:17,320
Destroy some

1283
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:17,320
exit that's St

1284
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:28,480
yeah and so since we are at this

1285
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,480
business of

1286
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:35,080
the let's just do it we have already

1287
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,080
done

1288
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:42,560
um few uh lectures

1289
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,960
ago the first low and second low

1290
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,280
efficiencies or heat engines uh

1291
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,400
refrigerator units and heat pumps but

1292
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:53,400
this is just the summary same equations

1293
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:56,239
that we already seen up there

1294
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:58,800
just notice

1295
01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:00,880
that the first low efficiencies a ratio

1296
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,480
where you put at the numerator an energy

1297
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,080
and at the denominator another energy

1298
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:08,880
typically the numerator is the useful

1299
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:11,159
effect that you want and the num the

1300
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,080
denominator is the resource that you are

1301
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:15,639
use and energy

1302
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,080
wise

1303
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:22,320
instead a second low

1304
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:24,000
efficiency you put at the numerator what

1305
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,760
you want to achieve and at the

1306
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,000
denominator

1307
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:30,000
uh the

1308
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:36,520
minimum

1309
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:39,520
expenditure that you need to uh pay in

1310
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:41,120
order to achieve that which is typically

1311
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,199
done minum in the sense of

1312
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:48,320
thermodynamics of course and so uh it's

1313
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,320
uh the reversible

1314
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:56,840
cake not saying this is the Practical

1315
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,840
Optimum using

1316
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:06,920
practice don't want to operate diversity

1317
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:09,320
or object is very to operate reversely

1318
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,360
because if you operate

1319
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:15,320
reversely most of the times you have to

1320
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:17,719
do it in such limiting conditions that

1321
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,719
you get

1322
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:25,560
nothing so in practice what you want to

1323
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,960
uh optimize

1324
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,960
is

1325
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:35,360
power

1326
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:37,000
or combination of power

1327
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:41,760
misss

1328
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:45,560
depending on the cost of

1329
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,719
equipment because of course the more you

1330
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:53,880
put in in terms of sophisticated

1331
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:56,840
equipment you may uh achieve uh higher

1332
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,840
efficiencies but

1333
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,800
uh it

1334
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:06,800
um the

1335
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,800
cost May kill you so you have to

1336
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,400
compromise therefore there are

1337
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:19,320
uh

1338
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,600
other terms in the equation of

1339
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:25,679
optimization in terms of practical and

1340
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:27,199
so here we're just talking about so this

1341
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,639
is the limitation of the second low

1342
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:31,199
efficiencies

1343
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:32,560
that it gives in denominator which is

1344
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:36,400
your term of

1345
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:39,159
comparison uh a the reversible process

1346
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:43,639
which may be too far away from

1347
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:45,120
practicality one one sort of sort of the

1348
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:48,960
uh

1349
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:53,239
halfway solution would be to put

1350
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:55,320
there uh the work required by the best

1351
01:18:53,239 --> 01:18:57,239
available technology to do do that

1352
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:59,520
particular

1353
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:02,199
job in that

1354
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:05,880
way at least you

1355
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:07,280
compare uh the efficiency of your device

1356
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,840
with the efficiency of the best

1357
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,840
available

1358
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,320
technology and of course if your device

1359
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:20,199
is better your efficiency will be

1360
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:23,239
higher higher than one and know and

1361
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:26,000
eventually your your your technology

1362
01:19:23,239 --> 01:19:29,000
will impact and will be become

1363
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
theology

1364
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:38,480
too all right

1365
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:41,960
so this view graph simply uh summarizes

1366
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:44,440
uh again the idea of first law where

1367
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:48,000
energy associated with the useful

1368
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:49,800
effects divided by the energy associated

1369
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,679
with the source that the resource that

1370
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:55,679
you have

1371
01:19:50,679 --> 01:19:58,440
used which could be burning a fuel or a

1372
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,440
using Sol

1373
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:05,080
energy and uh here for the second law

1374
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:07,920
you can cast it for second low

1375
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:09,080
efficiency you can cast it by saying

1376
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,960
that I put

1377
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,840
them

1378
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:17,080
also

1379
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:20,000
uh uh the exergen associated with the uh

1380
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:24,000
useful effect because the exer

1381
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
represents the

1382
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:31,760
work equivalent of that useful effect

1383
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:35,760
and then you put at the denominator the

1384
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:39,880
X and G associated with the source You'

1385
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:43,000
used you can uh to reason it out uh you

1386
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:45,080
you you realize that this is equivalent

1387
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,920
to

1388
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:51,360
uh putting here the energy of the useful

1389
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:56,080
effect and and the

1390
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:59,239
below um the

1391
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:02,440
the minimum resource you you should use

1392
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:04,199
in order to obtain that which is I

1393
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:08,560
think

1394
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:11,560
here see this form of

1395
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:15,440
the secondary

1396
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,400
efficiency is also equivalent once you

1397
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,679
do the balance equations and obtain the

1398
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,480
expression for the reversible work as a

1399
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:26,239
ratio of executes for example for the

1400
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:28,520
heat engine If the ratio of the exy of

1401
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:32,639
your product which is works so just pure

1402
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:36,800
exy divided by the exy of the resource

1403
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,800
which is heat times the Caro

1404
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,920
coefficient and notice that the Caro

1405
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,639
coefficient has to be

1406
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,719
computed

1407
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,400
using the temperature as environment the

1408
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:50,400
temperature of the cold dresser where

1409
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:55,600
which you using as uh an environment S

1410
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,600
as the the thing where you Dum your entr

1411
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:03,199
and similarly for a

1412
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:06,560
refrigerator this definition is

1413
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:11,400
equivalent to definition in which you

1414
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:13,000
have uh exergis numerator and

1415
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,159
denominator

1416
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,760
now for a

1417
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:24,040
refrigerator this is the exergy of

1418
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:26,159
cooling uh with a the cooling load QB

1419
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:29,320
times the this is equal to a caral

1420
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:32,280
coefficient minus signs becomes a caral

1421
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:35,440
coefficient

1422
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:37,920
uh but here now you see uh the can

1423
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:40,719
coefficient with the T at the numerator

1424
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:45,120
so the T of the environment now is the

1425
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:49,639
hot because in the refrigerator you are

1426
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,480
uh pping entropy to the um with the

1427
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:55,360
Environ which is hotter than the

1428
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:57,600
refrigerator cell and similarly uh here

1429
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,600
for

1430
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:12,679
the so going back to this idea of uh

1431
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:14,840
exergen so the word exergen or the board

1432
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:19,080
availability in the old times there were

1433
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:19,080
fights about how should we call

1434
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:28,480
it that has been I I participated in

1435
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:28,480
conferences where people were really

1436
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:36,600
F nowadays I

1437
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:39,960
think uh the body is more R about the

1438
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:42,880
idea and then it just use ex ability

1439
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:45,360
doesn't really matter it's a generic

1440
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,360
concept

1441
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:52,040
of so X andg does have one

1442
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:59,719
definition you different forms of

1443
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:02,120
exit for example we encountered the many

1444
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:04,120
already for example thetic availability

1445
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:08,000
is a form is is one

1446
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:12,760
ex is the xfg associated with when

1447
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,760
you when you restrict yourself to weight

1448
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:18,080
processes well you can call that like an

1449
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:22,360
adiabatic system system that goes all

1450
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:22,360
weight process you can call it adab

1451
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:31,040
or we have

1452
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:34,360
seen that if your system is as

1453
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:38,440
um is in

1454
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,440
combination with a thermal

1455
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:47,760
Reservoir the maximum uh you can do the

1456
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,320
maximum work you can uh do depends on

1457
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,800
the type of

1458
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:54,960
reservoir the res is fixed volum we we

1459
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,800
have this U that we call available

1460
01:24:54,960 --> 01:25:01,119
energy Omega R but then we have defined

1461
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:04,119
also available energy with respect to

1462
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:07,159
other kinds of

1463
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:09,760
reses where the res can change your

1464
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:12,159
volume or maybe the the osmotic resare

1465
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,800
where you can exchange it through a semi

1466
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:18,480
per membrane only one type of substance

1467
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:21,159
or a completely open uh uh Exchange in

1468
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:26,320
which your system can

1469
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:26,320
uh exchange volume and any of the amount

1470
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:32,719
these are all

1471
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:37,280
EXs different formulas same

1472
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:37,280
word work is just pure

1473
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:46,159
exy a heat interaction just said so the

1474
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,199
ex associated with the heat interaction

1475
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:51,199
at temperature the

1476
01:25:48,199 --> 01:25:55,960
Q is given by the

1477
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:55,960
heat times the K coefficient

1478
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,800
exit

1479
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:05,679
requires as as before

1480
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:07,760
here requires a reservoir is a reference

1481
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:11,440
in some

1482
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,440
cases not in

1483
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:19,760
here for heat interaction it does uh

1484
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:19,760
require

1485
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:29,239
that and need to specify what kind of

1486
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:31,480
uh what so you need to specify to choose

1487
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:31,480
a

1488
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:38,400
temperature it's relative exy is

1489
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:43,040
relative to a choice of the particular

1490
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,040
reference environmental temp

1491
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:50,320
yes but even that makes it

1492
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:55,159
that road concept so you can Define uh

1493
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:58,159
uh the ex for a cooling uh uh Heating

1494
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:58,159
coing

1495
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,719
interaction

1496
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,480
and for example suppose you have a

1497
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Machinery

1498
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:20,119
that operates like a herno engine and

1499
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,480
this is simple simple case in which we

1500
01:27:20,119 --> 01:27:22,480
have two

1501
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:29,920
reservoirs but but suppose that the

1502
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:34,400
neither the the hot Reservoir nor the

1503
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:34,400
cold Reservoir are environmental

1504
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:42,960
me for

1505
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:46,840
example this cold Reservoir could

1506
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:49,000
be the your house the house that you

1507
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:56,320
want to warm

1508
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:57,960
up they want to be at uh 70 fite or 21

1509
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,000
in a

1510
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:03,719
seat in your

1511
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,600
house and one way to keepit up uh your

1512
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:10,080
house it's actually one of the best

1513
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:13,600
ways from the point of view of

1514
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:15,199
thermodynamics is to do is to have uh do

1515
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:19,159
use C

1516
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:21,400
generation you use some

1517
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:25,719
uh

1518
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,719
costly heat source

1519
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:30,760
for

1520
01:28:27,639 --> 01:28:34,360
example uh okay this is a reservoir so

1521
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:41,760
it's not exactly so is proper example

1522
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:41,760
but uh usually you buy gas to heat up uh

1523
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,800
uh

1524
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,639
water and then you have your water

1525
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:57,159
circulate in like

1526
01:28:52,639 --> 01:29:00,040
here heing elements and that uh uh hot

1527
01:28:57,159 --> 01:29:02,239
water is going to heat up the air in

1528
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,239
your

1529
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:11,520
room so you're using a gas with which

1530
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,520
you could uh reach very high

1531
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:18,320
temperatures and all you do is by a

1532
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,199
series of heat

1533
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,560
transfers use

1534
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:25,080
it to produce something at the

1535
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,520
temperature which is very close to the

1536
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:30,480
environmental P that's a very dissipated

1537
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:34,080
way

1538
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:38,159
doing we have been doing it all for a

1539
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:38,159
long time like this we're still doing

1540
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:45,520
it like that's the way it's done in my

1541
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:47,800
apartment building where I did now and

1542
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:51,199
the but that's

1543
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:54,199
not the good way it's a it's a very

1544
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:54,199
inefficient

1545
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:03,760
cogeneration is the idea that you

1546
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:07,840
take that high level

1547
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:11,840
energy and uh before you

1548
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:15,600
uh you do the as much as you can with it

1549
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,199
you do for example run a power plant or

1550
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,199
run a plant or

1551
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:20,199
run

1552
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,719
engine for example you could run a

1553
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:29,800
carrent

1554
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:33,239
engine you this is are call total energy

1555
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:35,239
modules like car or truck engines or

1556
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:38,320
maybe ship

1557
01:30:35,239 --> 01:30:42,600
engines depending on the size where you

1558
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:46,199
burn your fuel Mak uh mechanical

1559
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:49,560
energy um with that mechanical energy

1560
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:51,800
you produce

1561
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:55,840
electricity and

1562
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:58,560
then since your engine needs the dump

1563
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:02,320
entropy somewhere instead of dumping it

1564
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:05,760
directly into the environment you dump

1565
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:09,280
it into the heating system of your house

1566
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:13,119
and then it when your house take care of

1567
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:17,159
but dumping the mg the DI

1568
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:20,000
uh so you get this uh heating as a

1569
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:24,800
byproduct or as a one of the two

1570
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,440
products of your system which is a

1571
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:31,280
combined

1572
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:36,360
uh Eon power is called cogeneration of

1573
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:36,360
CHP solution and in this

1574
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:43,800
way you

1575
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:46,199
use that nmg at at best so this would be

1576
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:50,159
say the available

1577
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:54,800
best available technology for example in

1578
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:54,800
the town where I

1579
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:02,199
worked 30 years longer which is briia in

1580
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,239
Italy this

1581
01:32:02,199 --> 01:32:08,520
idea has been

1582
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:13,600
taken very seriously starting in

1583
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:17,520
1973 and now about 95% of the volum of

1584
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:20,360
the town and it's a town the size of

1585
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:23,880
Boston

1586
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:25,600
um it's heated in this way with k

1587
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,920
generation power

1588
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:32,520
plants that dump energy into a district

1589
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:36,159
heating system they get this hot water

1590
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:37,760
going around the town under the roads

1591
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:40,119
and reaching all the houses and then

1592
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:45,920
when he exchanges you do

1593
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:50,119
the uh you more

1594
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:53,880
recently see 20 years ago uh they also

1595
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:57,199
added that um in the more complex system

1596
01:32:53,880 --> 01:33:03,280
in which you also not only use uh fossil

1597
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:05,960
fuels but you use also waste uh eurn the

1598
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:09,560
the like tach that is not

1599
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:14,360
recyclable and uh they also integrated

1600
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:18,000
with the hybrid way with some solar so

1601
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:21,920
it's an entire system aimed to uh

1602
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:25,080
efficient efficiency for uh he through

1603
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:27,639
the the homes

1604
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:30,520
I know that many are thinking about

1605
01:33:27,639 --> 01:33:33,320
doing things also uh in the States but

1606
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:36,440
here the the the problem has been that

1607
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:39,760
um the problem the reason that these

1608
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:44,159
things have not evolved is the cheaper

1609
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:47,040
costs of energy addition when one

1610
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:50,920
incentive for improving efficiency is

1611
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:55,520
the cost of that ener I the cost invest

1612
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:57,440
to spend less yeah

1613
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:01,080
here with

1614
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:05,199
what I'm not an bats I'm

1615
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,199
in okay

1616
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:14,480
go some

1617
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:14,480
forun the man it's great D

1618
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:21,520
morning GL to know

1619
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:24,199
yeah yeah probably I thought that

1620
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:28,159
somebody was thinking of also yeah uh

1621
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:32,760
doing it for the town like the problem

1622
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:36,239
is that takes it takes a lot of

1623
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:39,480
investment and the way it got started in

1624
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:42,159
in brasia was that um the municipal

1625
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:45,920
company was

1626
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:49,920
um the company that would run also the

1627
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,800
roads would would run r a lot of uh uh

1628
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,920
public

1629
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:58,320
services including transportation

1630
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,320
and so they could um s of

1631
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:04,639
decide and move quickly about the moving

1632
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:07,360
because they were people working on the

1633
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:11,520
roads putting pipes because you need to

1634
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:15,560
put large pipes uh and

1635
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:18,239
go it they it's if you do it internally

1636
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:20,320
it it is easier and also they they did

1637
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:23,960
it in such a way that

1638
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:26,840
uh there's another issue is uh people

1639
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:30,880
want to be to get um connected to the

1640
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:34,000
his eing system but

1641
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:37,560
um sometimes it's more efficient to

1642
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:41,040
start with big buildings and then go

1643
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:46,320
to this kind of the seizur are with

1644
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:50,119
political and so uh that is a issue

1645
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:53,119
okay sorry we are late so see you next

1646
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:53,119
time
