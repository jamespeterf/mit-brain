00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Hello and welcome to Today I Learned

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,679
Climate, the climate change podcast from

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,040
the Massachusetts Institute of

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,759
Technology. I'm Lauri Fischer. Today's

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,199
drivers are buying a lot more electric

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:23,279
vehicles, or EVs, as they're also known.

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,519
In fact, from just 2022 to 2023, the

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,279
world's demand for the batteries that

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,119
power these EVs grew by 40%.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,760
And that's prompted several listeners

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,920
and readers to ask us, what are we going

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,480
to do with all of these EV batteries

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,719
after they die? And as our guest today

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,600
will tell you, that's not a trivial

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,399
problem. My name is Linda Gaines and I

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,280
work at Argon National Laboratory and

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,120
I've been looking at life cycle analysis

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,000
which is basically an analysis of what

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,039
goes into the manufacturer of all sorts

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,079
of goods from raw materials in the

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,680
ground all the way through a finished

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,720
product. Where does the product get

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,400
manufactured? How does it get

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,840
manufactured? And then at the end of its

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,040
life, can you reuse it? Can you repair

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,360
it or do you have to just throw it out?

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,880
For our show, Dr. Gaines is going to

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,240
bring that lens to EV batteries. What's

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,000
in them? Can we recycle all of those

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,159
materials? And if not, what can we do

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
about that? And to get started, we

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,880
should be specific about what kind of

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,200
battery we're talking about. For nearly

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,799
all EVs sold today, that would be

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,520
lithium ion batteries. Lithium ion

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,880
batteries are much more energy dense

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,880
than other previous

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,000
chemistries. And so you can make a much

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,240
smaller, lighter battery. Lithium ion

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,799
batteries are the reason we have phones

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,200
that fit in our pockets and hold enough

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,399
charge to last all day. And this

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,119
technology is equally crucial for EVs. I

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,479
mean, there were electric vehicles

45
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,479
previously, but they were all powered by

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,720
lead acid batteries, which are very

47
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,800
heavy, and what those vehicles ended up

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,360
being was basically a battery on wheels.

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,319
And there wasn't really much room for

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,879
passengers or cargo or anything. With

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,440
lithium ion batteries, we now can have

52
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,680
roomy, zippy cars that run on

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
electricity. Now, this is a big deal

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,200
because cars and trucks that run on

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,599
gasoline produce literally billions of

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,000
tons of planet warming greenhouse gases

57
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,400
every year. And we would eliminate

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,640
almost all of that pollution if we drove

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
EVs instead and charge them on

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,080
electricity from cleaner energy like

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,400
wind, solar, or nuclear. And fun fact,

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
because of how energyefficient these EV

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
batteries are, even if you were to

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
charge your EV with electricity

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,599
generated from coal, you would still

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,040
produce less pollution than a

67
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,239
traditional gasoline car. But while EVs

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,200
don't burn gasoline, they do require new

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,920
kinds of materials that gasoline powered

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,200
cars don't. So, let's take a beat to

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,599
figure out what's inside an EV battery.

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,680
In any battery, there's an anode and a

73
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,800
cathode. And some charged particle,

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,280
either an electron or a lithium ion, is

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,080
going back and forth from one to the

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,360
other. And in one direction, it's

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,920
charging the battery. And then you can

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,720
connect a wire from one to the other and

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,000
electrons will go the other way and you

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,879
can get energy out.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's kind of like that child's game. Red

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,040
Rover, like red rover, red rover, send

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
the electrons over. When you're driving,

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,760
the electrons come running along a

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,920
circuit from one side of the battery to

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,159
the other, providing the power to move

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,720
the car. And then when you charge it,

88
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,599
they run back to where they started. And

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,400
there are many materials used to coax

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,400
the electrons across the battery. We'll

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,799
start with the lithium that these

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,599
batteries are named for. So when we say

93
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,120
lithium ion batteries, we're referring

94
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,280
to the single atoms of lithium that dash

95
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,880
across the battery like part of the same

96
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,960
Red Rover team. Lithium is a metal. It

97
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,000
can be mined and we also find it

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,840
dissolved in water. The way that it has

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,880
been extracted most until very recently

100
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,520
is from salt lakes. In particular,

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:44,160
there's a set of lakes in the Andes

102
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:47,440
Mountains in Chile that are extremely

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,759
concentrated in lithium salts. And so

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,040
what happens is you pump these

105
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,400
concentrated lithium salt solutions into

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,120
big ponds and let the sun evaporate the

107
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,360
water, which can cause problems when

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,759
there are water shortages, as Chile is

109
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,759
wrestling with right now. But it's not

110
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
just lithium that we're concerned about.

111
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,320
There's a part of the battery called a

112
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,160
cathode that is made of several metals

113
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:18,000
bonded together. The cathode material in

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,199
a lithium ion battery is a chemical

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,479
compound that's made of lithium and

116
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:29,280
oxides of cobalt, nickel, and manganese.

117
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,960
Historically, they've basically been dug

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,759
out in either surface or underground

119
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,759
mines and then taken to a

120
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,600
smelter. This can cause local problems.

121
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,520
For example, cobalt, one of those

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
cathode materials that Dr. Gaines just

123
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,680
mentioned, mostly comes from the

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,199
Democratic Republic of the Congo, where

125
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,520
many miners live and work in terribly

126
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,560
exploitative conditions. So, it would be

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,400
ridiculous to just throw these materials

128
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,680
away when a battery dies. But recovering

129
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,759
them is not quite as simple yet as

130
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,720
plucking a lump of cobalt out of an old

131
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,199
battery pack. That cobalt is bound up

132
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,360
with all the other metals in the

133
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,680
cathode. And then the battery also

134
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,479
contains an anode, an electrolyte, and

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,520
aluminum and copper. And all of these

136
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,880
materials are arranged in super thin

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,360
sheets and then folded or rolled up

138
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,840
together into what is called a battery

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,160
cell. But an actual battery pack has

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,960
lots of cells in it. And if you think

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,840
about a Tesla, Tesla has cylindrical

142
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,319
cells. They're kind of stuck like beer

143
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
cans in a six-pack kind of thing. If

144
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,280
we're talking about a Tesla Model 3, our

145
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,600
six-pack is actually more like a 3 or

146
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,199
4,000 pack with all of these cells

147
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,919
cemented together. And that pack is the

148
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,800
big rectangular slab that actually goes

149
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,680
into the car. And as you drive around,

150
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,000
just like everything else, this big

151
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,639
complicated battery slowly slowly starts

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,280
to break down. When the battery is

153
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,800
charged and discharged, the lithium ions

154
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,039
can get stuck on the surface of the

155
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,240
anode or react with some of the

156
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,199
molecules in the electrolyte. Basically,

157
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,880
fewer and fewer lithium ions are free to

158
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,360
travel back and forth. And so, the

159
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,599
capacity of the battery decreases as it

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,080
gets older. And eventually, after maybe

161
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,560
300,000 miles or so, this battery, like

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,639
all batteries, will die. And when that

163
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,960
happens, we'd really like to get the

164
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,919
valuable materials back so that we can

165
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,919
reuse them. But it's not like we're just

166
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,199
separating our paper from our glass

167
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,240
here. The cathode material is a very

168
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,800
elegant and complex crystal structure.

169
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,919
And if you can actually retain that

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,639
during the recycling process, you are

171
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,879
getting a much higher value product out

172
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,599
and not having to redo all of the steps

173
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,319
that it took to make it. Right? Ideally,

174
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,039
what we want is not actually pure cobalt

175
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,360
and nickel. We want the elegant crystal

176
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,000
structure that's so good at giving us

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,560
our electric charge. But the closer we

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,599
come to that ideal, the harder the

179
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,919
recycling process is going to be. So,

180
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,639
let's say you want to do as little work

181
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,879
as possible to recycle your battery. The

182
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,000
method for you is called pyro

183
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,360
metallurgical recycling. And in that you

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,760
basically throw the battery into a big

185
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,080
furnace and some of the stuff burns and

186
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,360
some of the stuff

187
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,720
melts. And what you get out of the

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:51,200
bottom of the smelter is a mixed alloy

189
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,480
of cobalt and nickel and manganese which

190
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,240
can then be put back into batteries

191
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,880
after processing.

192
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,440
A jumble of melted down metals is not

193
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,959
very close to our beautiful cathode.

194
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
Well, at least we don't have to mine the

195
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,399
materials from scratch. But we could do

196
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,720
better. So, the next option would be to

197
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,680
put the battery cells through a big

198
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,560
shredder and get them ready for hydro

199
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,440
metallergical recycling. You basically

200
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:25,040
dissolve the chopped up battery in acid.

201
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,279
And the acid is a big soup that includes

202
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,800
all of the different ions that were in

203
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,959
the cathode material and also anything

204
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,519
that was in the electrolyte. And you can

205
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:40,120
do chemical reactions on that soup to

206
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,160
recover the different elements

207
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,399
separately. The cathode is still

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,720
destroyed, but this time we have pure

209
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,040
metals to make a new cathode. That's

210
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,240
better, but it's still kind of wasteful,

211
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,320
right?

212
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,920
Ideally, I would like to see some kind

213
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
of a system where you didn't need to

214
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,959
shred the whole thing. One small company

215
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,000
in Switzerland in particular has

216
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,959
designed their own cells for recycling

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,880
and they are building a machine that

218
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,680
grabs one electrode and another arm

219
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,000
grabs the other one and just pulls apart

220
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,120
this whole layered structure. So that

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
one arm is holding anode sheets and the

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,959
other is holding strips of cathode. So

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,560
there they're things you can imagine but

224
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,360
none of them has been developed

225
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,760
commercially at a large

226
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,680
scale. This is called direct recycling.

227
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,640
And if we can do it, it would give us

228
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,560
back our cathode practically intact.

229
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,760
With a little fixing up, it would be

230
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,720
ready to put in a brand new battery.

231
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,279
But as you can tell, direct recycling

232
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,240
really depends on the manufacturers

233
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,800
designing their cells to be taken apart.

234
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,440
And so far, most battery engineers have

235
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,240
had other innovations on their mind. As

236
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,120
battery technology evolves, which it's

237
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,279
doing very quickly, that makes a big

238
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,880
challenge for battery recyclers because

239
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,040
they really don't know what they're

240
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,800
going to be having to handle 10 years

241
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,680
down the pike. And so it's hoped that we

242
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,240
can develop some recycling technologies

243
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,040
that are more or less generic and would

244
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,320
work no matter what the battery design

245
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,519
was. It's a challenge. So there's

246
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,279
another issue here and I was actually

247
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,880
quite surprised. There aren't yet enough

248
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,320
batteries to recycle. Originally, people

249
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,120
thought that electric vehicle batteries

250
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:40,800
would only last a few years and probably

251
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,440
would have to be recycled and replaced

252
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,079
sometime during the lifetime of the car.

253
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,560
In actual experience, these batteries

254
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,760
are really lasting the lifetime of the

255
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,959
car. And in fact, they may be outlasting

256
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,320
the car. And when they do outlast the

257
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,800
car, even then today's EV batteries are

258
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,399
mostly not going to recyclers because

259
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,120
they're still good enough to find a

260
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,959
second life. If you've got solar panels

261
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,000
on your roof and you want to store

262
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,600
energy to use at night, you can use an

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,560
old battery as a backup. There's a big

264
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,240
stadium in Amsterdam that's powered by

265
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,680
old Nissan Leaf batteries. So there are

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,839
lots of ways you can use these

267
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,720
batteries if you don't demand the level

268
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,200
of performance that people are expecting

269
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
from their

270
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,800
vehicles. So to step back for a minute,

271
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,399
we should also be clear about what

272
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,959
battery recycling can and can't do. It

273
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,000
can leave us with less waste when

274
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,560
batteries eventually die, but it can't

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,120
replace the need to mine more lithium

276
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,360
and cobalt and nickel. at least not

277
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,279
while the EV market is still growing as

278
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,560
fast as it is. If you think about it

279
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,959
logically, because there's been such

280
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,399
rapid growth, even if we could get back

281
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,880
everything that we put into circulation

282
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,920
10 years ago, it would only be supplying

283
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,079
a very small percentage of our demand.

284
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,639
So, we need to be thinking about where

285
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,880
all this material is going to come from.

286
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,120
Can we improve mining so that it more

287
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,000
efficiently produces the metals that we

288
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,320
need? And how can we of course improve

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,360
the conditions of these mines for local

290
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,360
workers and communities? Or can we take

291
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,800
the most challenging materials like

292
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,880
cobalt completely out of the equation? A

293
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,079
big portion of the EV market now is

294
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,360
using a chemistry called lithium iron

295
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,959
phosphate, which has no cobalt at all.

296
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,320
And there are EV batteries that are

297
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,920
using sodium now instead of lithium. And

298
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
just while we were recording this

299
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,720
episode, Ford announced it's investing

300
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,120
in cathodess that use mostly

301
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,760
manganesees, which they expect will give

302
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,399
them a longer driving

303
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,000
range. So, if you're asking how we'll

304
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,120
deal with all of these batteries when

305
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,079
they die, to some extent, we just don't

306
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,079
know yet. Partly because we're still

307
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,700
figuring out what they'll look like when

308
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,120
they're
