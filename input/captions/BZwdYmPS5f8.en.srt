1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,120
hi open course whereare Learners we've

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,320
gotten to the part of the first lecture

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,320
where the technical difficulties made it

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,039
little too hard to follow what was

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,240
happening there so I'm going to uh

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,640
re-record what we all did as the opening

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,640
of the class to begin go ahead and go to

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,920
the URL on the screen right now this is

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,559
a project from Google called collab that

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,000
allows you to run Python scripts

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,480
including music 21 in your own browser

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,600
without installing anything on your

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,480
computer

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
so so go ahead and click this play

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,039
button you're going to see a warning

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,120
that uh Google didn't write this

17
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,840
notebook I did U it's I think it's

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,960
pretty safe what it does is it installs

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,720
the latest version of music 21 and Muse

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,240
score and some other software needed to

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,360
uh run some of the tools we're going to

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,560
be using without installing python on

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,920
your computer Google already has a copy

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,880
of Music 21 but this just uh brings you

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,840
to the latest

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:28,240
version and go ahead and pause and we'll

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
come back after it's all installed

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,040
welcome back I hope that the cells

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,159
aren't um running anymore so we can

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,720
start uh coming in if you've never used

31
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,280
a Jupiter notebook or another online

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,560
collaborative environment the important

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,520
thing that you're going to need is to be

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,399
clicking into these cells the gray ones

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,159
are where U type and the uh ones with a

36
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,200
white or black background are the ones

37
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:02,079
where uh output's coming out in order to

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,600
run a cell you just type shift and

39
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,479
return or shift and enter so what we're

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,360
going to do is I'm just going to um

41
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,840
click into this cell and hit shift enter

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,200
and this will make sure that music 21

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,519
actually works sometimes the first time

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,680
you show a score it um it doesn't work

45
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,319
as well and on some browsers this will

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,959
work um you can listen to a score

47
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,640
and we's see if this works or

48
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,360
not there we go and now we're ready to

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,120
actually begin uh we're not going to

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
generate with AI today we'll write our

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,360
own

52
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,680
scores so with you're with me we're

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,000
going to start uh anything where you're

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,280
doing a python session by importing the

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,959
code that's useful and for this one it's

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,519
uh the music21 toolkit so we're going to

57
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:56,360
import everything from it if you're

58
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,840
somebody who done a lot of python and

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,840
cares about things like polluting your

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,080
namespace you can do individual mod

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,120
modules but I'm always going to do it as

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,319
if we have all the parts of Music 21 at

63
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,319
your

64
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,239
fingertips so we're going to load a

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,080
Corral by Johan Johan Sebastian Bach

66
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,040
it's a shortest Corral called bwv 66.6

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,680
so first I'll create a variable call it

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,640
boach and we'll use the Corpus tool from

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:32,480
music 21 and it's parse function to load

70
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:34,879
in Bach bwv 6 6.6 I'll hit shift enter

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,799
and it's assigned to boach and we can

72
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:43,120
call the method show on it to see the

73
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:44,879
score of that Yep looks like a crow by

74
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,159
Bach and you can see that has soprano

75
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:53,480
Alto tenor base and we can get the alter

76
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:57,360
part by saying um bach. Parts square

77
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,360
brackets open Alto and we'll just show

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
that

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,519
yes looks like the Alto part now we'll

80
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,599
get the soprano part and assign it to a

81
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,439
variable sop for soprano and we'll just

82
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,519
do that instead this time we'll get it

83
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,079
by doing the part number and so it's the

84
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:24,120
first part and so in Python that means

85
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:27,520
it's part zero Parts zero and one of the

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,400
things that we do in music 21 is when

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,479
something is in a programmer

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,320
rule we follow um the conventions of

89
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,960
programming where everything starts with

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,720
zero and when we're in musician space

91
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,080
such as talking about measures we don't

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,320
subtract one from the measure number or

93
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,919
anything like that so if we wanted to

94
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,400
just see measures 3 through five

95
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:56,560
inclusive of the soprano part we could

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:00,759
do something like that

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,520
oops or we could type the word measure

98
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,360
properly and then we'll get that measure

99
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,560
just gets a single measure this one got

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,560
that great and um in fact we'll use the

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,080
measure thing now and we'll get in

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,320
measure five the zero first second note

103
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,919
the one with the forada on it and so

104
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,000
we'll call it C because it's a c

105
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,120
actually it's a C sharp but um well

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,400
we'll see why not and so we'll get notes

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,319
number

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,199
two if we called it C

109
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,639
then everything after this would be a

110
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,639
common so that doesn't work so we'll

111
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:41,039
just call it c um and now what we can do

112
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,840
is manipulate it change its style it's

113
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,160
color to

114
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,360
red and now when I show the soprano part

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,120
because uh they're all linked to each

116
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,759
other we should see yep there's a note

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
that's in

118
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,360
Red so that's how we can manipulate a

119
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,639
score and now let's see how we can do

120
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,120
some analytical functions on things so

121
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,919
let's do Baka analyze and we'll analyze

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,919
the key of the

123
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,840
piece and it says it returns a key

124
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,520
object that says it's in F minor and one

125
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,280
of the things I really want to emphasize

126
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,000
is always go back and do the smell test

127
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,880
is this true ises it look like baloney

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,720
and we can kind of see well begins in a

129
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,919
but it does have three Sharps and at the

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:37,280
end yep there is an FP in the base so

131
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:40,360
looks kind of like F major but yeah okay

132
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,000
here some F minor okay it kind of passes

133
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,560
the spell tests and we'll see why that's

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,120
so important in just a little bit but it

135
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,639
did seem like it was beginning in a so

136
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,479
we can just analyze a portion of that so

137
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:58,199
we'll do B measures zero because we want

138
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,879
the pickup measure and two and we'll

139
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,680
analyze the of just that

140
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,680
passage uh does seem to start in a

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,520
major let's do something that seems

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,680
pretty simple let's count the number of

143
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,879
notes in the piece so we can just do Len

144
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,560
bach. notes that just gets uh all the

145
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,120
notes the piece in another language

146
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,879
would be bl. notes. length and I don't

147
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,120
know

148
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,919
um I don't know how many notes are in

149
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,639
the piece but I'm pretty sure it's more

150
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,000
than zero and the Reas reason for this

151
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,840
is that music 21 and most ways of

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,759
conceiving music on the computer don't

153
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,120
think of the score as having notes the

154
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,879
score has Parts the parts have measures

155
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,840
and the measures have notes so what we

156
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:55,879
could do is get the length of Bach Parts

157
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:58,199
one measure two do notes and see okay

158
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,639
that passes the smell test so what we

159
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,520
can do instead is we can use something

160
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,680
called recurse so we'll get the bach.

161
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,159
recurse that's a function or a method

162
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,960
and we get the notes on that and what

163
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,639
recurse says is open up every box you

164
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,039
get to a part open it up look inside for

165
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,159
measures open it up and keep going until

166
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,639
you find

167
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:25,360
notes and 165 notes that seems to pass

168
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,039
the smell test to

169
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,879
me right now we've been working with

170
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,440
this as a series of of parts that are

171
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,440
not connected to each other but of

172
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:40,039
course there are chords in there also

173
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,279
but if we do um B Dot and here's another

174
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,279
way you can say recurse I want to

175
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,480
recurse and get everything that's a

176
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,480
chord there are no chords in this piece

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,720
so we have to create some chords using

178
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:59,399
the chordify method so we'll say core

179
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,399
for chords equals buck. chordify

180
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,800
and now if we

181
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,920
show the cified

182
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,760
method and we can see that some of these

183
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,720
notes are way too low to be read

184
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,360
properly and they have duplicated notes

185
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,519
and things and over the course of the

186
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,040
semester we'll find ways that we can

187
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,519
make this a lot more representable

188
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,720
including things like getting rid of

189
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,640
passing tones and other things that

190
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,120
disturb looking at the chords but for

191
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,320
now we can look at chord chord for the

192
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,680
chords the number of chords in that and

193
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,000
see that yep that looks like a

194
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
reasonable

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,040
number so I hope that gives you a taste

196
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,680
of some of what we're going to be doing

197
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,440
over the course of the semester of this

198
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,600
class now we've gone very fast through a

199
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,920
bunch of things but don't worry because

200
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,640
we're going to lock all those things up

201
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,880
cify is going to be locked up anal

202
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,120
analyze key is going to be locked up and

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,519
what mean that means that it won't be

204
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,959
available to be used in the rest of the

205
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,519
class until it's unlocked again the way

206
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,640
this class is going to work is all these

207
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:17,160
analytical tools all these ways of

208
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,399
conceiving a score will Begin by being

209
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:25,640
locked and then you'll do an assignment

210
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,920
either as a problem set or as uh in in

211
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,720
class assignment where we'll figure out

212
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,519
how does this work what what are the

213
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,800
ways of doing this and then once you've

214
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,839
designed your own algorithm for doing

215
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,440
these things you can either continue to

216
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,519
use your own algorithm or you will have

217
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,959
unlocked the music 21 version of the

218
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,760
algorithm and from then on you can use

219
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,240
that instead so we're going to just be

220
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,200
building up knowledge little by little

221
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,680
until we have

222
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,360
everything one of the things that as an

223
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,079
open courseware learner you won't have

224
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,120
access to

225
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,680
is the extremely valuable things that

226
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,720
happened outside of class yes coming to

227
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,079
office hours but mostly with students

228
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,399
helping each other giving each other

229
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,920
inspiration for projects they could do

230
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,720
and helping them through some of the

231
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,839
more difficult parts of the class so I

232
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,839
encourage you if you can find somebody

233
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,160
else online who's also taking the course

234
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,639
or somebody who has taken it in the past

235
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,639
and get to know them that will give you

236
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,920
a lot more of the experience that the

237
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,320
students had at MIT when they were

238
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,040
taking the class in

239
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,519
person I'm so glad that you've chosen to

240
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,000
take your time to learn about the

241
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,880
fascinating world of Music Theory and

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,519
music analysis with a computer and I

243
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,760
look forward to seeing you again from

244
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,760
time to time in this course
