1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:20,080
Okay. So, so right. So just to remind

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,720
you, so so last time,

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,519
so last time we looked at we had this

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,279
sort of motivating example that we had a

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:33,440
graph, we had a function f defined on

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,480
some interval from a to b and it was

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,120
going inside the real numbers and it

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,680
started off negative here. This here is

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,360
f of a. This is negative and it ended up

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,440
positive

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,960
f of b and we wanted to say and this was

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,960
a continuous function

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
uh

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,040
and we wanted to say that there was some

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,040
c. So we wanted to

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,600
to um show

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:21,439
that there's a C between A and B so that

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:26,040
the value at C is equal to zero. So this

19
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,040
was the intermediate values then

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,360
and so this was sort of the motivation

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
for

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,320
the motivation this here was a

23
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,280
motivating example for trying to

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,000
understand what property of R do we

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,000
need. So so the so what property

26
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,840
of R. Do we need

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,000
uh to make this

28
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,599
to make this rigorous? So that was the

29
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,080
that was sort of the motivating example,

30
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,520
right?

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,920
And so in order to make this rigorous

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:27,440
well then we we need the concept of we

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,319
need need to concept of that r we need

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:35,879
to understand um uh the following

35
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,879
statement that r is a complete

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,239
uh ordered

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,239
uh field

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:56,599
and a field here. So field here just

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,599
briefly field here right was a set

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,319
with uh two operations

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,640
uh plus

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,640
and uh and what we call multiplication

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,959
each of these.

44
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,480
So each of these

45
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,480
two operations

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,760
have uh five property

47
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,120
and then there's an 11th property uh

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,120
plus then there's an 11th property

49
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,879
that chain them together

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,159
and the last one is usually referred to

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,200
as a distributive law.

52
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,720
So, so that was one of the two important

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,959
concept that we talked about last time.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,799
The other concept that we talked about

55
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,799
was what's called an ordered set.

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,960
So uh so so that's a set uh with an

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,880
ordering

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,759
and the ordering has to have the

59
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,880
property that so this here the ordering

60
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:41,000
has the property.

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,000
So it has actually two properties.

62
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,840
[Applause]

63
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,400
Uh the first one is that whenever you

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:58,320
take an element x and an element y in

65
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,440
the set then either you should be able

66
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,440
to relate these two by the ordering. So

67
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,440
either

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:19,560
x is equal to y or x is smaller than y

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,560
uh or uh or uh y is smaller than x.

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,120
And the second property is what's called

71
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,360
transitive that if X and Y and C are

72
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,759
element in the set

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:40,560
and X is less than Y and

74
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:43,600
Y is less than C then

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,759
X should be less than C. So this is the

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,400
22 property.

77
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,280
So the first property again is that you

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,880
can compare any two elements and the

79
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:59,680
second one is this transitive law. Okay.

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,960
And then so that was the two concepts we

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,560
we talked about last time and then we

82
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,840
talked about uh what it meant to be an

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,840
ordered field. So so then we also talked

84
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,840
about

85
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,840
ordered fields and an ordered field is

86
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:28,560
right. You have a field that is also an

87
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:32,240
ordered set and then those two uh then

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,639
the then the relationship so this will

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,360
that one being less than the other one

90
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,600
have to interact. So this is these two

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,840
things that if you take x is less than y

92
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
and you're adding any elements on both

93
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,319
sides

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,759
then uh it still preserve the order.

95
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,479
So this is one thing and the second is

96
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,960
that if you take x that's bigger than

97
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,440
zero and y that's bigger than zero then

98
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,960
the product

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,440
of x and y should be bigger than zero

100
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,880
and so this is how the the right so an

101
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,440
ordered field again is a field that as a

102
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,840
set is also has an ordering and then the

103
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
ordering ing together with the operation

104
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,960
of the field should be chained together

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,599
by these two laws. Okay.

106
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,680
Now, so we are we are we're getting

107
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:37,199
close to understanding this, right? So,

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,759
so this question is so in order for all

109
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,759
of this to make sense,

110
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,720
we need to understand what it means that

111
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,599
the real numbers is a complete ordered

112
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,599
field, right? And so we have now this

113
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,720
part of it that it's an ordered field.

114
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,400
We understand that this here is uh we

115
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:04,000
need to understand what this means.

116
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay. So now before I get into that

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
let's just talk about so what is the

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
difference

119
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,639
the difference

120
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,879
between

121
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,319
uh the real numbers and the rational

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,560
numbers,

123
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,520
right? Remember the rational numbers are

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,279
numbers of this form here where this is

125
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,120
an integer and this is a natural number.

126
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,519
So what is the difference between these

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,599
two?

128
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,599
But one difference is so one difference

129
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:57,680
is that that square root of two

130
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,440
um is is a real number

131
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,640
but

132
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,640
but not a rational number.

133
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,880
Okay.

134
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,200
Now let me try to explain why first why

135
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,399
it's not a rational number.

136
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,800
So let's try to see uh so what is square

137
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,800
root of two?

138
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,279
The square root of two.

139
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,839
You can think about it as a number x and

140
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,160
it has to have the property that if you

141
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:47,839
multiply it by itself, so x * x or if

142
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:53,519
you will x 2, this should be equal to

143
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:56,519
two, right? It also should be positive,

144
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,519
right?

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,360
Now suppose so I claim that square<unk>

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,279
of two is not a rational number. So by

147
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,880
that I mean that so so I want to claim

148
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,049
the following.

149
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,049
[Applause]

150
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,920
that does not exist.

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,640
A rational number

152
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:45,279
um x = to m / n. Well, again this here

153
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,440
is a integer. This is a natural number.

154
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,440
So that

155
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,560
x² is equal to 2.

156
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,959
So I claim that that's that that you

157
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,160
don't have a rational number that is

158
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,560
square root of two. Okay. Now let's try

159
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,560
to prove that.

160
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,129
[Applause]

161
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,880
So suppose suppose there was such a

162
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,360
number. So so we want to prove it. So we

163
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,360
prove by contradiction.

164
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,609
[Applause]

165
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,120
So assume

166
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:45,240
[Applause]

167
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,240
that there exist

168
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,079
x that is a rational number. So it can

169
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,079
be written in this form here where m is

170
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:59,120
an integer

171
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:02,000
and n is a natural number.

172
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,240
So assume that there exist a x that is

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,079
that is a rational number and so that

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,839
the square is equal to two right. Well

175
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,839
if that's the case then m

176
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,880
over n so this here squared is supposed

177
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:25,920
to be equal to two right. So this means

178
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:30,560
that so this implies that m2

179
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:35,560
over n^2 is equal to 2 and this just

180
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,560
multiplying over implies that m2

181
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:44,959
is equal to 2 n^2.

182
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,880
Now when we write x as a rational

183
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,800
number, of course we know that there are

184
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,040
many ways of writing it as rational

185
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,000
number because you can just if you have

186
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,720
one then you can just multiply the

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
denominator and denominator by an inte

188
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,839
by a natural number sorry and then you

189
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,519
get another representation right but we

190
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:09,360
can assume so we may assume

191
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,600
so when we have written so uh we may

192
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,600
assume Assume

193
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:26,440
that's m and n

194
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,440
and n does not have a common factor,

195
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,000
right? Because otherwise we could just

196
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,839
reduce it. So we could reduce it until

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,839
we they don't have a common factor.

198
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,440
Right.

199
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,079
Okay. So, so we we will assume that m

200
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,839
and n do not have a common factor. We

201
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:58,160
have now that m squ is equal to this.

202
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:03,480
But this means that m here must be even.

203
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,480
Right? So we have that since

204
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:11,680
since m 2 is equal to 2 n

205
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,920
squar. So it means that two is a is a

206
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,320
factor in m squ. So it must actually be

207
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:22,600
a factor in m. So it means that two here

208
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,600
is a factor

209
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:33,120
in m. In other words, m is even.

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,160
But so you can write m here as two times

211
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,160
another integer here.

212
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Right?

213
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:52,560
But this means that m 2 is equal to 2 m1

214
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,880
squared which is equal to 4 m1 2 right

215
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,240
and we already know that that is equal

216
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:02,160
to 2 n^2

217
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:06,560
right so this means dividing by two on

218
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,560
both sides it means that 2 m1^ 2 is

219
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,320
equal to n but this means that sorry is

220
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:18,160
equal to n^2 so this means that two here

221
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:25,399
must be a factor in n right so this

222
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,399
means here that two is also a factor

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,440
in n but now you see that this is a

224
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,920
contradiction

225
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,839
so this is a contradiction because now

226
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,519
what we have is that two two is a factor

227
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,680
in m and two is a factor in n. So they

228
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,320
have a common factor but we assume they

229
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,120
didn't have a common factor. Right? So

230
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,040
this prove so so we argued by

231
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,759
contradiction. We assume there was a

232
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,000
rational number so that the square of it

233
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,240
was equal to two and we get a

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,320
contradiction. So that could not be a

235
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,519
rational number

236
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,920
um uh that has a property that the

237
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,800
square is equal to two. So so square

238
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,000
root of two is definitely not a rational

239
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,000
number. Okay.

240
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Now

241
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,000
so now how do we think about

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,639
uh how do we think about square root of

243
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,639
two? So how do we fit

244
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,560
square<unk> of two into the number

245
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
system?

246
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,600
Right?

247
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,759
Well, square root of two

248
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:58,160
is if you think about it as a decimal

249
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:01,160
uh number, then it is uh it starts with

250
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,160
1.4

251
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,760
2

252
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,480
uh uh 136 and then it 136

253
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,000
and then it continue like this.

254
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,520
So one way of thinking about

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,360
uh square root of two is that it is and

256
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,360
we will come back to this at some later

257
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,919
lecture. So we think about so so one way

258
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,919
of thinking about

259
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,080
square is true. is

260
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,600
as a limit

261
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,600
of a sequence of number.

262
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,720
And that that that brings us to a

263
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,320
another really important concept uh that

264
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:07,120
we will talk uh much more about later is

265
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,840
this with sequences and limits. And so

266
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,000
if we want to think about it as a limit

267
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,840
of a sequence, we think about maybe the

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,799
number one

269
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,760
first and then we think about 1.4 and

270
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,480
then we think 1.4.1

271
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,080
and then 1.4

272
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,720
1

273
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,720
and then 1.4

274
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:37,520
uh two etc. Right? And so you see that

275
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:41,640
this here is a sequence of numbers. And

276
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,640
so this is an increasing

277
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,000
sequence of numbers

278
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,600
of numbers.

279
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,799
and and square root of two

280
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,799
is the limit

281
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,480
of the sequence.

282
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,640
So again we will talk much more about uh

283
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,039
sequences and limits uh later but this

284
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,640
is just something to keep in mind as a

285
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,360
kind of also motivating why we need to

286
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,240
understand sequences and and limits and

287
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,240
their limits. Okay.

288
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:36,559
Okay. So this was so so we we now know

289
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,400
maybe not super surprisingly but but we

290
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,240
we know and you know see there was a

291
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,120
very simple proof why uh the real

292
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,600
numbers is larger than the rational

293
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,320
numbers contain in particular square

294
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,200
root of two uh that the rational numbers

295
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,160
does not contain.

296
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,600
we still need to and this is related to

297
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,640
the completeness of R and why the

298
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,160
rational numbers is not complete. Okay,

299
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,960
but this is again what we're now working

300
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,600
uh towards. So we're working towards

301
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,600
what it means to for a field to be

302
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
complete.

303
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,229
[Applause]

304
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,200
So let me just write that and and and

305
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,960
I'll explain it more but just this here

306
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,960
is what we aiming towards

307
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,559
completeness

308
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,679
which is and I'll explain that at the

309
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,679
least upper bound property.

310
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,919
Okay. So suppose you take a ordered set.

311
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,919
So suppose

312
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,720
uh S is an ordered set.

313
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,880
[Applause]

314
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,880
So and the ordering we as usual with

315
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,880
ordering

316
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,000
we do by by this.

317
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:41,360
So suppose S is an order set and suppose

318
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,760
that A here is a subset of S. Then we

319
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,120
say that

320
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:52,840
we say that um

321
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,840
m is an upper bound

322
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,360
an upper bound for the subset

323
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,720
for a

324
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,720
if for all

325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,120
elements in a

326
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,039
um

327
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,760
m here

328
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,679
is bigger or equal

329
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,400
to a. So an upper bound is something

330
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,039
that h of for a subset is something that

331
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,520
has to be bigger than all the elements

332
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,039
in the subset bigger equal to it could

333
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,039
be equal to to one of the elements.

334
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:38,760
So that's a upper bound. And so of

335
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,760
course if you look at

336
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,400
So a couple of examples here.

337
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,559
So,

338
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,559
so if you're looking at if the set here

339
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,679
uh is

340
00:22:52,559 --> 00:23:00,000
is um if if the set here is let's say

341
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:05,600
that the set is um so s is the natural

342
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,960
numbers here and uh the subset here is

343
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,200
one two three

344
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,840
then the element so then the element

345
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,840
four here is an upper bound

346
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,159
for uh a

347
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,880
um so four is an upper bound for a

348
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,960
whereas

349
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,320
right whereas um

350
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,039
whereas two is not

351
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,039
right obviously three is bigger than two

352
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,039
so uh two is not an upper bound

353
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:56,080
Another example is um another example is

354
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:59,440
if you take uh if you take say if s is

355
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,360
the the let's say s is the rational

356
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:10,080
numbers

357
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:14,039
and uh and a here is the natural numbers

358
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,039
then a

359
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,760
Then uh a here does not have an upper

360
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,760
bound.

361
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:37,600
Okay. And I I'll I'll return to this

362
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,559
uh this second example uh in just a

363
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,559
minute.

364
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,559
>> Okay.

365
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,200
So, so that is what it means to be an

366
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,720
upper bound.

367
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,919
So, now

368
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,640
there's another concept and that is a

369
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,640
least upper bound.

370
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,880
So there's another concept of the least

371
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,880
up above.

372
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,080
So again we have S is an ordered set.

373
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,960
we have a here is a subset of s.

374
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,640
Uh then we say that

375
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:58,039
it's a subset of s maybe let me just

376
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,039
point out that that is bounded

377
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,720
Um so A is a subset of S that is

378
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:19,039
bounded. Then we say that

379
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,720
then we say

380
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,880
that

381
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:30,360
capital M is an upper bound

382
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,360
is a a sorry is a least upper bound.

383
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,679
least upper bound

384
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,679
for a

385
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,679
if

386
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,640
m is

387
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,799
an upper bound. So it has to be an upper

388
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,799
bound

389
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,799
and

390
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,039
if

391
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,039
any other upper bound and for any other

392
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,039
B

393
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,320
other upper bound

394
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:20,480
we have to have that for any other upper

395
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:24,840
bound say M1 we have that m1 m1 has to

396
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,840
be bigger equal to m.

397
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,159
So it has a least upper bound

398
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,960
if a boundary set has a least upper

399
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:39,200
bound if there is an element that is the

400
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,200
smallest to so to speak of the upper

401
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,200
bound.

402
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,799
Okay.

403
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:54,799
And so now so now we are ready to to

404
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,200
state what it means to be a complete

405
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,200
order field.

406
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,120
So a complete

407
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,520
order field

408
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,279
um is

409
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,360
an ordered field.

410
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,520
It's an order field so that uh so that

411
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,159
uh any bounded subset

412
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,480
subset

413
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,480
has a least up.

414
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,120
Okay,

415
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,840
so that's a complete orders field and

416
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,240
and so we have the foreign theorem that

417
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,240
we're not going to prove because that

418
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,640
really takes us off field.

419
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:27,720
Uh but but um so we just take it for

420
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,720
granted. But there exist.

421
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,559
So theorem

422
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,000
exist the smallest

423
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:39,720
uh so there exist

424
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,720
a smallest

425
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,760
complete

426
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,960
uh ordered field

427
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,960
that contains the rational numbers.

428
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,679
uh numbers.

429
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,480
Okay, so this is a theorem. Again, we

430
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,880
won't prove it uh because it's really

431
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,399
kind of outside in the scope of this

432
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,039
class. It's not really what we want to

433
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,679
focus on here. Uh but um but it but you

434
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,520
can prove this.

435
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:34,600
And so

436
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,600
um so that field

437
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,919
field

438
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:47,240
is uh what we call r is it's a it's a

439
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,240
real numbers. Okay.

440
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:57,200
Um okay. So now I want to see

441
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,440
uh why I want to see that if we work

442
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,320
with that field instead of the rational

443
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,840
numbers then actually we have in

444
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,279
particular that uh the square root of

445
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,279
two is in that

446
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,640
So, so we will now see. So, we want to

447
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,640
show

448
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,640
that uh square root of two

449
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,919
is in the real. Okay.

450
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,279
So now I'm going to look at the set

451
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,760
A.

452
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,320
So I'm going to look at the set A which

453
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,000
is the element

454
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,240
um

455
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,640
which is the element in R

456
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,919
such that X here is bigger than zero.

457
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:13,919
and uh x2

458
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:17,840
is uh is less than two.

459
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:22,080
Okay. So I'm going to look at this set.

460
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,880
Now of course this set here so a here

461
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,679
is bounded. It's not empty. Let's say

462
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,679
first it's not empty.

463
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,799
Right? It's not empty since

464
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,880
since one here is in a right one is

465
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,640
positive and 1 squared here is of course

466
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:49,760
one which is less than two

467
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:53,080
so it's not empty and a here is also a

468
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,080
is bible

469
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,960
right because uh any element so for all

470
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,960
X.

471
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,600
So for all

472
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,919
X in A

473
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,720
uh you have that X squar is is it's X is

474
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,480
positive and is less than two. So this

475
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,279
means that X here must be itself less

476
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,200
than two, right? Because two of course

477
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,200
when you square it you're getting four,

478
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
right?

479
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,440
So it's a bounded. So a here is a

480
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,319
bounded subset of the reals.

481
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,319
[Applause]

482
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,480
Now

483
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,799
so now the real has the least upper

484
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,799
bound property.

485
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:56,120
So this means that I can now define

486
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,120
so define

487
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,360
square root of two

488
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:07,279
to be the least up about

489
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,399
define it to be

490
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,399
the least up

491
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,119
Okay, but a was a bounded it was a non-

492
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,520
empty bounded subset. So because it we

493
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,839
are in the reals

494
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,280
if you grant this theorem then there is

495
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,280
a least upper bound. Okay.

496
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:42,159
So now

497
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:45,159
let's denote. So it let me denote let me

498
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,159
use

499
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,359
denote

500
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,359
this number

501
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,920
by x. I'm going to denote it by x

502
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,240
instead of square root two because if I

503
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,640
if I denote it by square root two then

504
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,240
it's going to be confusing right and

505
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,880
it's like you know you will sort of

506
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,160
automatically use what you think square

507
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:16,960
root two should satisfy so let's not

508
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:20,200
let's call it uh let's call it uh

509
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,200
uh x

510
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:28,240
so I want to prove so it's clear that

511
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:33,480
since

512
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,480
X here is at least up about

513
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,880
for a

514
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,320
and

515
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,440
in particular one is in A then it means

516
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,640
that one here has to be less or equal to

517
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:56,880
X right and one of course is positive.

518
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,160
So it means that X here is definitely

519
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,599
false. Right?

520
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,400
Now we need to show that we need to show

521
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,200
that the square.

522
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,200
So we need to show

523
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,640
So we need to show

524
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,400
that

525
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,160
uh that x²

526
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,880
is equal to two. Right? That's what we

527
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,480
need to prove in order to prove that x

528
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,480
is really the square root of two. Right?

529
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,400
So I'm going to divide it up. So we

530
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,400
divide the proof

531
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,119
the proof

532
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,200
into two steps.

533
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,960
The first one is the first one is that

534
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:10,280
we uh we want to so the first step. So

535
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,280
step one

536
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,760
we're going to show that x² is lesser

537
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,760
equal to two. So this is what we will

538
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,520
show in the first step. Right? And then

539
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,160
the second step will be the reverse

540
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,040
inequality. And of course together this

541
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,040
would be the proof. Right?

542
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,480
So again just like we argue uh before

543
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,839
uh we're going to in this case we will

544
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,880
also argue by contradiction.

545
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,480
It's not a you may get the feeling that

546
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
we're always going to argue by

547
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,680
contradiction in this class and we won't

548
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,200
and it's generally thought of that is

549
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,320
better style to prove things directly

550
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,880
but sometimes it's a much more logically

551
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,040
logical and kind of easier in a way at

552
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,880
least easier at the first time to prove

553
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,920
it by contradiction and there's nothing

554
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:08,359
wrong with proving it by contradiction.

555
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,359
So we will show this by contradiction.

556
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,079
Okay.

557
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,839
And so

558
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:35,670
so right. So we're going to show that

559
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,670
[Applause]

560
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,200
So we show this by contradiction and so

561
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,680
we assume first. So assume

562
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,680
assume not.

563
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,720
So assume

564
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:09,320
assume that x² is not less or equal to

565
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,320
two. So we assume not. So

566
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,359
assume

567
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,440
that x² is strictly bigger than two.

568
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,480
Now I will look at x minus some small

569
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,119
number

570
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,520
and I'm I'm going to eventually prove

571
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:36,839
that if I'm looking at at x minus some

572
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,839
small number

573
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,920
I'm going to prove now that if this hair

574
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,880
was strictly bigger than two then I can

575
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,359
find some small number so that this here

576
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,599
would also be an upper bound. So x

577
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,359
h would be positive.

578
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,000
This here would be a number strictly

579
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,400
less than x. And I would show that this

580
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:06,400
here is also of a bound. That's what I

581
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:09,760
want to do. Okay. So I take x minus h

582
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:15,359
and I square it.

583
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,960
If I do that then I get that uh this is

584
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,640
x2

585
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:26,320
minus 2 xh

586
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:28,160
+ h 2 right the square is is not

587
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,680
negative. So this here is definitely

588
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:37,000
bigger equal to x^2

589
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,000
- 2 xh

590
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:44,040
and so you see that right

591
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,040
and so now

592
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,800
so now uh if you take so now you have

593
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:55,119
that x²

594
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,880
is uh by we have that x2 is bigger than

595
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,240
2.

596
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,400
So this means that x^2

597
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,720
minus uh 2 is positive. I am just

598
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,440
subtracting two from both sides. So this

599
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,160
here is we're assuming that this here is

600
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,160
positive. Right?

601
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:22,079
And so now if I just make sure that um

602
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:25,520
so if I now make sure that what I am so

603
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,640
if I so now

604
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,079
I'm going to choose so I want to choose

605
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,560
so I want to prove that x minus so so

606
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,960
want to show so I want to get the

607
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,960
contradiction

608
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,520
by finding a

609
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,640
finding

610
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,880
a h bigger than zero.

611
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,880
So that

612
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,839
x - h is also

613
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,599
an upper bound

614
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,040
for a right because this here is clearly

615
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,359
smaller than x right and this would then

616
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,839
contradict that x was the smallest upper

617
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:25,359
part right so that's what I want to do

618
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,680
and

619
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:33,960
and so now how do I do that so using

620
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,960
this little calculation here.

621
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,880
So what I want to do is so I want to

622
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,880
find so I want to find

623
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,079
h positive

624
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,839
so that

625
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:56,079
when I square when I subtract h from x

626
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,440
and I square it then I still get

627
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,880
something bigger than two right so I

628
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,040
want to find h positive so that This

629
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,480
thing here

630
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,839
is bigger than two, right?

631
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,079
And all I need to do is from I need to

632
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:18,599
show that I can find H. So that this in

633
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,599
here. So enough to show

634
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,440
to show

635
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:31,040
that I can find find

636
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,640
h such that

637
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,880
x^2

638
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:40,040
- 2 xh that this thing here is bigger

639
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,040
than two.

640
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,560
Right? And so you see I now I just move

641
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,520
over on the other side to say that this

642
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,680
here is bigger than two. It's the same

643
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,480
as saying I can just move this two over

644
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,240
on that side

645
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,319
and I can move this here over on the

646
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,319
other side. So I just need to find

647
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,920
h with this property. Right? But that of

648
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:17,839
course is equivalent to saying that h

649
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:20,400
has to be less than x^2 - 2 over 2x

650
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,119
is positive. This thing here is strictly

651
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,960
positive. So I can certainly find a

652
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,359
positive number. This is something

653
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,280
strictly positive. So I can certainly

654
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:34,240
find some small h so that is less than

655
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,079
this strictly positive number. Right?

656
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,599
Okay,

657
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,960
so this proves this is step one. This is

658
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,520
just showing that x2 was less or equal

659
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,599
to two. Right? Now I want to argue

660
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,680
similarly

661
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:55,560
um similarly to prove the other

662
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,560
direction. Okay.

663
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,960
I mean in this case there's not really

664
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,319
any difference, right? I mean the you

665
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:27,200
see in a minute that one inequality is

666
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:30,079
not uh any easier than the other. Uh I

667
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,960
have one I have a colleague here. He's

668
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:36,079
retired now, but he and he collaborated

669
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,400
with some other guy and they made a lot

670
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,359
of famous work and the other guy maybe

671
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,200
become even more famous and he used to

672
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,480
say that when you do mathematics so it

673
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,960
doesn't really apply here because the

674
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,119
two inequality is just as easy but he

675
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,359
used to say that when you do two when

676
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:55,680
you do mathematics there's three things

677
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:58,319
you do you locate a problem you prove

678
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,520
one of the two inequality whichever one

679
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,520
is easier

680
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,040
and you ask Ragu. Rau was his

681
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,040
collaborator to prove the other

682
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,040
inequalities.

683
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,720
Okay. So we so step two is um

684
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:23,920
so step two is that uh x²

685
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:27,359
is uh is bigger equal to two. Right? And

686
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,359
we will again prove this. So again show

687
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,359
this

688
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,040
by contradiction.

689
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,400
Okay.

690
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,400
So I assume

691
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,720
not

692
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,720
so I assume

693
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,200
that

694
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,200
uh x² here is strictly smaller than two.

695
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,280
Now what we want to prove is so then we

696
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,079
want to we want to get the

697
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,839
contradiction.

698
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,720
We want

699
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,720
to get the contradiction

700
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,000
by showing

701
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:39,119
that

702
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:43,160
X is not is not an upper bound.

703
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,160
An upper bound for A.

704
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,319
Right? X was supposed to be the least

705
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,880
upper bound in particular and upper

706
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,760
bound.

707
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,599
So how do we do that? Well, we we're

708
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,520
going to add just a little bit to X.

709
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,000
So this is sort of similar to how we

710
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,000
argued before.

711
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:24,079
So, so, so I'm going to add, so h again

712
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,480
is being positive.

713
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,960
So, h is positive.

714
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,960
And I'm going to add just a little bit

715
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,880
to x. And I'm going to see that if I

716
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:41,839
choose h small

717
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:45,920
then then um I can find something in the

718
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:49,760
set so that uh if I choose it so that x

719
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:54,000
so I can so I want to prove that if h is

720
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:58,079
small enough then x + h

721
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,720
is an a okay contradicting that x was an

722
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:03,760
upper bound. Okay.

723
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,839
And so h is going to be chos small. So

724
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,800
in particular, it's going to be between

725
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:15,520
zero and one. Okay. And I'm looking at x

726
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:23,119
+ h and I'm squaring it. So this thing

727
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:28,000
here is x2 + h 2 + 2 h x.

728
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:31,440
Now uh h here is less than one. So this

729
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,640
means that 8 squar since

730
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,920
since 8 is less is positive and is less

731
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:42,000
than one then you have that h squar here

732
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:46,400
sorry then you have that h squ is less

733
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,160
than uh than actually h right

734
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,760
and so this thing here is less than uh

735
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:58,640
x2

736
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:00,559
+ h + 2 uh h X.

737
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,800
Okay.

738
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:09,040
And I want to show So I want to show

739
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:12,960
that I can So I want to show that this X

740
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,960
+ H this is still in A. So I want to

741
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,960
show

742
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,119
that I can find that we can find

743
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:33,040
such a

744
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:35,280
such a h so that this here

745
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:39,599
this here squared

746
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:42,319
is still less than two. Right?

747
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,680
But so all I need to do is because of

748
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,119
this inequality I just need to find an h

749
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,040
so that this thing here is less than

750
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,040
two. Right? So I want to

751
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,240
to find

752
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,640
H such that

753
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,640
this thing here

754
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,800
is listen to right

755
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,839
now.

756
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,400
Now um right so now again we're just

757
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,920
moving over on the other side we're

758
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:33,119
moving this in this case we're moving

759
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:36,480
this x squ over here so we have h + 2 h

760
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,000
x is less than this is what we want to

761
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:43,200
find

762
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,680
right what to find

763
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:51,839
and h such that this thing here is less

764
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:54,240
than 2 - x^2 right this thing here is

765
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,599
now because x^2 is strictly less than

766
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,960
two this is positive right here you can

767
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:04,000
just factor out an h so you want to find

768
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:09,680
so if you factor out an h then you have

769
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,599
this thing here is less than 2 minus x^2

770
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,599
and this is just saying that you want to

771
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:22,640
find an h so that this thing here is uh

772
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:24,480
is strictly less than 2 - x^2 / 1 + 2x

773
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,760
is positive.

774
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,920
So this thing here is positive.

775
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,599
So this and this here is also positive.

776
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,920
So this here is a positive number. So

777
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,800
you can definitely find some x with this

778
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,640
property, right? And then you see that

779
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:43,520
so this means that this x + h would also

780
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,880
be in the set a contradicting that x was

781
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,880
an upper bound.

782
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,880
Okay.

783
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,880
Now

784
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:59,520
um okay so now a corner we immediately

785
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:03,920
get of this is that the

786
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:06,800
that the rationals

787
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,720
is not complete

788
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,839
right so

789
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,839
so we get the following corner

790
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,160
the rational number is not complete

791
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,160
Right?

792
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:33,200
And this is just because so the proof of

793
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:39,480
that is that we have already so um if

794
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,480
we're looking at the the this this

795
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,760
at a field that is complete and contains

796
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:48,640
a rational then we know that square root

797
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,880
of two is in that field. Right? So we

798
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,880
just proven

799
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,760
that

800
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:04,200
if f

801
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,200
is a complete field

802
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,400
containing the rationals

803
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,640
then

804
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,880
square root of two

805
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,119
is in that field.

806
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,480
Right? But we know that square root of

807
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:33,240
we have also proven we've also shown

808
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,240
we have also shown

809
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,920
also shown

810
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:44,559
that square root of two is not a

811
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:47,200
rational number. Right? So, so the

812
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:52,200
rational, so if you're looking, so the

813
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,200
rational in itself is not complete.

814
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,480
Um,

815
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,160
okay.

816
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,240
Now, the next thing I want to do is

817
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:06,000
prove what's called the Archimedian

818
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:08,000
properties. The Archimedian property.

819
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,640
And so, this is actually something that

820
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:16,000
was sort of used here. Um, sort of used

821
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:19,319
it I know it already, but let me just

822
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,319
prove it

823
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,440
because

824
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,000
so the Arimedian property.

825
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,920
So this is the following

826
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,280
that um that for all

827
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,079
for all

828
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,839
real numbers every time you take a real

829
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,400
number

830
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,400
then there exist

831
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,640
uh an integer

832
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,200
even a natural number

833
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:26,720
in such that

834
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:29,280
uh n here is bigger equal is bigger than

835
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,160
uh than than x. Okay, this seems like a

836
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,280
kind of trivial fact, right? But let me

837
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,880
try to actually prove it uh in a

838
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,319
rigorous way. So this is what's called

839
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,319
the Archimedian property.

840
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:50,760
And so again

841
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,760
we prove this by contradiction.

842
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,520
So suppose not

843
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:13,040
so if there existed an X. So that you

844
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:15,359
did not have this. Well then so suppose

845
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,440
not

846
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,520
then

847
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,640
there. So the negation of that statement

848
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,640
is that then there exist

849
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:32,079
an x such that

850
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:36,119
for all

851
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,119
natural numbers for all

852
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,839
you have that n here is lesser equal to

853
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,480
x

854
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:46,559
right it's actually yeah it's lesser

855
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,359
equal to x right because this is the

856
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,319
negation

857
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:54,000
of that.

858
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:57,319
But this means that

859
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,319
this means

860
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:05,079
that

861
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,079
uh x here is an upper bound.

862
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:16,799
Okay. And so now you could so now so so

863
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:20,079
then you could take so assume

864
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:22,799
So you could replace by this by the

865
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,520
least upper bound property.

866
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:28,520
So this means so it's upper bound. So in

867
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,520
particular

868
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:41,480
the natural number is a bounded set.

869
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:41,480
Bounded subset bounded subset

870
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:49,760
of of the reals. Right?

871
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:51,760
And then you could take so then we let

872
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,079
then

873
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,599
let's let's say y

874
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,119
be

875
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,119
the least upper bound

876
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,960
uh of the natural numbers.

877
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,680
If it really was if the natural numbers

878
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,760
was really bounded because it's a subset

879
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,680
of the real we could now take the least

880
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,960
upper bound.

881
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:24,079
Okay. So now what we have is that we

882
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:30,040
have that

883
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:30,040
for any natural number. So for all

884
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:38,319
we have that n here is lesser equal to

885
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:40,400
y.

886
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:44,640
But whenever you take a natural number

887
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:50,520
then add one to that nual number. So we

888
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,520
also have we would also have that

889
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,720
right. So so y is not just a upper bound

890
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,440
for n but it actually because n plus one

891
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,200
is also not actual number right. So y

892
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,359
here

893
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,640
would have to be big or equal to n plus

894
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:12,000
one also right but this and this now

895
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:14,400
hold for all n. So this means that just

896
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,520
moving the one over on the other side.

897
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,680
So hence

898
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:24,319
n here is less than y minus one. Right?

899
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:26,400
So this but this here say that so mean

900
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:29,119
this means

901
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,720
this mean

902
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:38,280
that y -

903
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,280
1 is also an upper bound

904
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:49,200
[Applause]

905
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,000
and that that and that this is a

906
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,520
contradiction right so this contradict

907
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,520
that

908
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,520
uh that why was the least up about

909
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:10,400
okay and that's the property

910
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:14,319
okay

911
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,960
now uh I want to give uh one application

912
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:20,400
of this

913
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,400
uh and so this is the following

914
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,119
What the hell?

915
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:51,480
So, so we now uh I now want to prove the

916
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,480
following corner of the Archimedian P.

917
01:01:53,599 --> 01:02:01,680
And the corner is that uh whenever you

918
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:05,040
have two real numbers x and y.

919
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:08,640
So these are are real numbers and x here

920
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:12,119
is less than y. Then the claim is that

921
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,119
then there exist

922
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,160
a rational number

923
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:31,280
m over uh n

924
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,440
with

925
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:39,440
uh with a property that is between these

926
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:43,520
two. so that that x is less than m / n

927
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,520
and less than one. Okay, that's what I

928
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,520
want to prove using the archimedian

929
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,520
property.

930
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:58,599
And so so to prove that so to prove that

931
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,599
um

932
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:10,440
so to prove that I look at at better

933
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:10,440
saying better is y - x

934
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:19,680
and I'm looking at uh so y - x because y

935
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:23,359
is bigger than x this is positive

936
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:27,039
And I can now look at one over beta. So

937
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:28,559
one over beta is some positive real

938
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,440
number.

939
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:36,520
And now the Archimedian property say

940
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,520
that. So by the archimedian property

941
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,839
the Archimedian property there exist

942
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,480
there exist

943
01:03:53,520 --> 01:04:02,200
um n a natural number

944
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,200
such that

945
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:10,559
n is bigger than

946
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,799
one over b,

947
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,440
right? That's the armedian property. It

948
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,480
gives us this n.

949
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:20,720
But now, of course, if that's the case,

950
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,280
this implies

951
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,760
you just take one over on both sides and

952
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:29,680
that reverses the inequality. This

953
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,440
implies that 1 / n is smaller than

954
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,319
better.

955
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,319
When we get that

956
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:43,960
and so now we are just looking at so now

957
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,960
we look at

958
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,599
so now that's this sort of defined as

959
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:56,720
step size to some extent. So we're

960
01:04:53,599 --> 01:05:00,640
looking at so we have here

961
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:04,880
X and we have here Y

962
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:07,200
and beta bet better is really this

963
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:11,039
distance here this here is better

964
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:14,880
distance between the two

965
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:17,599
and uh n here is uh we now have seen

966
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:22,640
that there's a n so that when you're

967
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:25,760
looking at 1 / n then then uh so one / n

968
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:29,920
here is smaller then better something

969
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:34,240
positive and smaller and better.

970
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:40,440
So now you're looking at the at the m So

971
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,440
now you're looking at So now look at the

972
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,280
at the integers

973
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:49,680
so that uh m

974
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,920
minus one

975
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:59,599
so that m minus one uh is

976
01:05:53,920 --> 01:06:01,839
uh uh is less than x *

977
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:06,160
So suppose you're looking at the right

978
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:08,720
this thing here right if you take x * n

979
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,480
this is an integer so there's definely

980
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:16,319
some m with this property and you can

981
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:19,680
find the biggest so look at

982
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:22,319
m with this property and let's and let's

983
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,640
denote n

984
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,640
and choose

985
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:31,200
the largest

986
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:34,599
the largest

987
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,599
such m.

988
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:46,880
So if you choose the largest such m then

989
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:52,640
you see that right so this inequality

990
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:57,599
here this will just tell you that m -1

991
01:06:52,640 --> 01:07:02,280
uh over uh over uh n that this is

992
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,280
smaller than x right

993
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:10,680
but you would also have that because it

994
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,680
was the largest such m Okay.

995
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:18,920
Since

996
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,920
Since M was the largest

997
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:29,680
such

998
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:33,200
such m then you would have that if you

999
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,520
had m itself in the denominator then it

1000
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:39,200
wouldn't be smaller than than x. would

1001
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,720
actually be larger equal to x,

1002
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,079
right?

1003
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:47,039
And I just want to now prove that this

1004
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:49,520
so this here is bigger than x. That's

1005
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,000
part of what I needed to prove. I also

1006
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:55,000
wanted to show that it's smaller than y,

1007
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
right?

1008
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,760
And um and so but if you now add, right?

1009
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:07,760
So now but now the step size. So when

1010
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,760
you have here here you have x here you

1011
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:13,760
have y

1012
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:15,920
1 / n 1 / n was smaller than this

1013
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,799
distance. So if you are at some point

1014
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,960
here this is where you are when you are

1015
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:25,520
at m minus one / n then you can't go

1016
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:29,679
further to the right. you you go one

1017
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:32,960
over n uh to the right, but that can't

1018
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:36,319
take you all the way past one, right? So

1019
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:39,440
that's why if you're looking at at this

1020
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:42,480
number here, this here must be smaller

1021
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:45,279
than y.

1022
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,600
Okay? And if I had just chosen m so that

1023
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:50,799
this here was smaller equal to that,

1024
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,520
then I would get this point.

1025
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:56,400
Okay? So that's how

1026
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,600
that's a corary of the Archimedian

1027
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,359
property. I think there would be

1028
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,400
something like something along these

1029
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:05,040
lines on the homework. And again, I will

1030
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,560
uh I'm just waiting for the the office

1031
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,480
hour. I know that the office hour there

1032
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,799
will at least be four office hours next

1033
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,199
week. Monday

1034
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,640
uh on Mondays and Wednesday the office

1035
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:17,600
hours would be there will be office

1036
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:21,520
hours from 5 to 6 on Monday and

1037
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:25,759
Wednesday. uh um and and the other days

1038
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:27,920
it would be 1:15 to uh 2:15. But you can

1039
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,600
check the the the the time is actually

1040
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:33,600
already uh posted. Uh the room number I

1041
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:37,040
hope to have that today. Once I have

1042
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,040
that then I will also assign the

1043
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,199
homework probably today or maybe more

1044
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,359
likely tomorrow the homework but it

1045
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:45,359
won't be due next week just the

1046
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,880
following week.

1047
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,880
Any

1048
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,880
questions?

1049
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:56,880
And of course, I very much encourage you

1050
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:59,600
to go to to the office hours. Um, and um

1051
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,360
yeah.

1052
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,360
>> Yeah.

1053
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,360
>> Sorry.

1054
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:09,239
>> Yeah.

1055
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:17,920
>> Right. So remember that the minus1 was

1056
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:20,640
this element that you had when you had

1057
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:24,239
uh remember that a field had the true

1058
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,880
operation plus and multiplication right

1059
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:28,880
and and for each of these that had five

1060
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,880
property they were sort of they were

1061
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,280
sort of

1062
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,440
almost the same property there was one

1063
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,080
exception about that zero didn't have a

1064
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:41,920
inverse right for multiplication but

1065
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,760
minus one is is the right so you one but

1066
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,520
one is the neutral element for

1067
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,239
multiplication

1068
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,800
right that was how one was defined right

1069
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:53,760
and we prove that that there was a

1070
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,480
unique zero right that same argument

1071
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,440
would prove that there's a unique one

1072
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:02,400
okay so there's just one one so it's a

1073
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,040
well- definfined notion and then you can

1074
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,760
look at the inverse element of that with

1075
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,840
respect to addition that's minus one

1076
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,840
right

1077
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,840
Yeah.

1078
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,239
>> Yeah. And that's a good question and I

1079
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:23,760
will come back to that next time. And

1080
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:26,640
and it it would seem more logical to

1081
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:30,320
define both upper and lower bound. But

1082
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:32,880
you can look at the complement,

1083
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,040
right? And so if you take a set and

1084
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,040
you're looking at the complement, then

1085
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,360
the upper bound for that is the same as

1086
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,360
the lower bound. So that's a kind of

1087
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,440
sneaky way. That's the reason why we did

1088
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:47,280
it. I, you know, I I might have done it

1089
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,360
the other way around, but then it was

1090
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:52,000
kind of a little bit overkill, but I

1091
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,600
agree. It seemed more logical to define

1092
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,239
both things, but it actually is

1093
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,239
contained in this.

1094
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,679
Any other questions?

1095
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,679
>> Yeah.

1096
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:31,520
I mean so we had so so again u we we saw

1097
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,760
that square root of two is not a

1098
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,800
rational number right and if We're

1099
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,600
looking at all rational numbers.

1100
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:43,920
All rational numbers so that the square

1101
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:47,360
is less or equal to two. Right? That set

1102
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,440
does not have a it has an upper bound in

1103
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,840
a rational number, but it doesn't have a

1104
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,159
least upper bound. Right? Right. And

1105
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,199
that's because we we first prove that

1106
01:12:54,159 --> 01:13:00,800
there wasn't a rational number so that

1107
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:04,719
it it multiplied itself was equal to

1108
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,719
two. Right? We proved that.

1109
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,880
Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's

1110
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,960
right. That's right. That's right.

1111
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:15,600
That's right. That's right. So, a field

1112
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:17,679
by it's right. A field is complete means

1113
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:21,760
that whenever you take a subset of that

1114
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:24,880
field that is bounded then that subset

1115
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:27,440
has to have a least upper bound and but

1116
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:31,719
any bounds including the least of bounds

1117
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,719
that always have to be in the fields.

1118
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,120
Any other questions?

1119
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,120
>> Yeah.

1120
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,600
smaller than one because

1121
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:56,960
we can do the

1122
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:59,360
>> so this is in so so when we when we um

1123
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,040
so you're saying so

1124
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,600
so I just want to make sure I understand

1125
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,880
so in the step two

1126
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,360
we added something and we wanted to

1127
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:13,600
prove that you could add something and

1128
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:17,840
this is still less than two

1129
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:20,719
And and so I was looking for h between

1130
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:24,159
zero and one.

1131
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:26,400
And so then I I got some equation

1132
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:30,880
somewhere that is probably a raised now,

1133
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:33,600
but it just require that h was

1134
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:38,280
I mean h have to be positive but it was

1135
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,280
less than something and that was

1136
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,199
>> right. So, so you you Okay. So, I got I

1137
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,080
don't remember what I got here. So, I

1138
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:51,199
think I uh Yeah, you're right. Two. I

1139
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:55,440
can I guess I can reconstruct it.

1140
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:59,440
>> Yeah. So, now I So, so I think so what

1141
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:01,199
you are saying is that so so this thing

1142
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,679
here actually so this thing here is

1143
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:06,719
positive, right? And so you want to

1144
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:11,360
choose h so that is smaller than this

1145
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:14,880
but also this here. So you don't but if

1146
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:18,000
this is positive then I mean if this is

1147
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,080
500 well uh I mean I'm not going to

1148
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,239
choose 500 because it was supposed to be

1149
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,400
less than one but I just choose it so

1150
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,199
that it's less than one and also less

1151
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,199
than this positive number.
