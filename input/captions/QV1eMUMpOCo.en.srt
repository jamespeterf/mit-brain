9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,240
>> Okay. Uh let's see some of the

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
administrative stuff. First of all, um

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
Wednesday's our play test. So it's an

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,719
internal play test. you'll learn to play

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
with each other's games. Uh which means

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
chances are you're going to get in about

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
enough time to play one person's game

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
and enough time for you for that group

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,120
to play your game. So, we're just going

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,079
to just basically pair teams. Uh

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,320
hopefully I think we have 14. So, I

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
think that works out just right. But,

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,559
uh, one thing I would certainly

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,960
recommend before going on to Wednesday's

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,480
class is making sure that you've had a

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,879
chance to play test with at least

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
someone who's not in your group. Uh, and

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,559
the reason for this, what you want to be

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,720
keeping an eye out for are rules that

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,240
you've already agreed on in your team,

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,479
but might have forgotten to write down

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,439
somewhere. Um, I want the rules written

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,159
down. Uh, they don't necessarily need

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,400
need to look great. Uh, type is awesome

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,040
because they're easy to read, but uh,

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,880
and and they're easy to revise later.

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,320
Um, it's not actually a requirement, but

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
you got to have them written down. You

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
should be able to just put it in front

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,080
of person. I would suggest actually

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,799
making a couple of Xes uh if you want to

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,960
you come in early uh on Wednesday. Uh

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,640
I'll I'll I'll activate the gambit

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
Xerox. You just make a couple of copies

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,840
so that the entire the entire group of

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,280
four people who's going to be testing

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,640
your game can just read all the rules at

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,320
the same time while you're explaining it

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,479
to them. Um, for the most um, if you're

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,079
in a situation where you already have

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,320
rules that you think could be understood

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,399
without explaining, I would suggest not

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,399
explaining at all. Just give them the

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,159
rules and see what they make of it. But

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
it's going to be very informative that

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,439
that way. Not every single team may be

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,799
in that situation. You may not have that

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,160
much confidence in this point. If you

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,959
think you've gotten all your rules

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,480
written down, but you don't you just

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,720
kind of not feel a little not quite so

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,800
confident that everything's in there, do

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,480
it anyway. Just don't explain it. Give

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
it to them. See what they're having

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,160
problems with and explain it. Um it'll

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
still be informative. you still be able

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,680
to get that data point of what should we

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,879
have written down as a clarification uh

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,280
as a complete omission you know uh what

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,800
needs to be rewarded uh before the game

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,400
actually starts um but uh I do fully

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,720
recognize that there may be certain

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,519
teams that do not have a set of rules

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,440
that's that comprehensive yet in the end

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
you want to get your play testing time

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
so you know it's going to take half an

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
hour for somebody to understand your

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,879
game just by reading your rules, then

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,720
you do want to try to cut that down

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,800
eventually before you submit your your

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
your game. You want to be in a situation

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
where someone can understand your entire

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,159
game quickly by reading the rules.

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,560
>> Um, when you're play testing and timing,

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,879
>> we weren't sure, we didn't remember, we

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
didn't read carefully enough, the what

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,159
is the maximum time that the game has to

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,280
take and does that include setup from a

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,280
complete novice or does that include,

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,879
you know, do you Are you allowed to

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,239
explain the rules and have totally

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
experienced players go at it? And once

91
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
experienced players go at it, it has to

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
take a certain amount of time. How how

93
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,879
does it

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
>> It was supposed to be for novice

95
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,480
players, but you know, I'm just going to

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,760
check the actual uh uh syllabus.

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,360
>> So, we have to be able to explain the

98
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
entire game, run through the entire

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,799
playthrough and all that in 10 minutes.

100
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,480
>> That that one I wasn't sure. I think

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
it's actually only a play through, but I

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,319
but give me a sec. I'm going to look it

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,720
up.

104
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
>> That'd be great.

105
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,959
>> I'm pretty sure it says 10 minutes. 10

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
to 20. Five 10 minutes of 10. Yeah. 5 10

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,159
minutes including setup and play.

108
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
>> Including setup and

109
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
>> but does that include excluding

110
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
>> not necessarily

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,920
>> it should include read.

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,080
>> It should not

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,319
>> it should not 10 minutes is way too

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,959
short a time to read and understand and

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
play a game.

116
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
>> Yeah, let me just verify that

117
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,720
about it.

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
>> Our game takes like two minutes to play

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,799
at the moment.

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,799
the news.

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
>> It can take very short time. It can take

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,040
really long for creating a deck that has

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
more information written on each card.

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,240
I'll just take time to write it. So that

125
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,600
that way the right lesson

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
card.

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,040
>> So I uh it's true. It doesn't say 10

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,880
minutes. Uh that that that take it you

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
need to be able to play and understand

130
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,600
the game in 10 minutes. So, I'm going to

131
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,680
say setup and play has to be 10 minutes.

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,840
So, it's like every time you reset the

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,440
game and you play to the end, that

134
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,360
should take that should be under 10

135
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,759
minutes. If it takes longer than that to

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
understand the game, that's fine. But,

137
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,120
frankly, if it takes more than 10

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,240
minutes for someone to understand your

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
games, you have a problem. Uh, and the

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,120
problem isn't going to be one that's

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,440
going to affect your grade. is going to

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
be one that you can use the processes in

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
this class to iterate on to improve your

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
game to the point where it doesn't take

145
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,800
that long to understand because the game

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,880
reading the rules should not take longer

147
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,840
to think

148
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,000
there are games like that but try not to

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,919
make those games uh at least not as

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,320
precise

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,919
uh so I would say aim for the the

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,479
explanate the explaining of the rules to

153
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,479
also take within 10 minutes right now

154
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,320
I'm not quite sure uh it might be okay

155
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
if the actual explanation require

156
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
requires someone who's actually an

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
expert in the game to explain it. By the

158
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,560
end of this assignment, you should be

159
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
definitely getting to the point where

160
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
you don't even need that. Just a new

161
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,919
player with your rules should be able to

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,759
understand and play your game in 10

163
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,759
minutes. It could it could involve

164
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
discussion of an entire group of new

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,280
players. Like, you know, you got four

166
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
people, you say four card game, you have

167
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,160
four people and you're all looking at

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,800
the room simultaneously and the queen

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,560
says, uh, why does it say so and so? And

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
somebody else who has never played a

171
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,520
game before answers that. That's fine.

172
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,240
And that's actually how a lot of people

173
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,080
play. Um, sometimes people put in quick

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,720
start rules on this is this is all you

175
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,120
need to know to play your first round of

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,960
of cards and that actually helps a lot

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,080
of people get started, you know. Uh, and

178
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
then they're like kind of picking up the

179
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
other

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,960
>> lowers the activation energy.

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um, and in the end more

182
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,120
people play your game. That's that's

183
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,039
that's a good that's a good thing.

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,960
Um, so that's on Wednesday. Everyone

185
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,720
please come on time uh because every

186
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
minute that we and uh waiting for

187
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,639
someone to show up feeds into that and

188
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,240
full teams don't show up actually. Who's

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,880
who's designing a game that has to be

190
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,880
played by four players?

191
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,120
>> So there are some differenc

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
Okay.

193
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,759
>> All right. Not bad. Cool. All right. So

194
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,759
So even show

195
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,280
>> Okay. Um

196
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,840
>> All right. So that's preparation for

197
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,919
Wednesday. Now, um I do kind of want to

198
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,880
apologize for Friday's lecture. I was on

199
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,400
I was on a lot of meds. Uh you may or

200
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,720
may not have noticed I was having

201
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,240
splitting headache and it was not the

202
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
best lecture that I've given in my

203
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
entire teaching career. In fact, it was

204
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,520
probably the worst lecture I've given in

205
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,960
my entire

206
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,960
>> I didn't. Well, oh

207
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,240
wait,

208
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
um, it occurred to me that there might

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,319
actually be a better way to sort of get

210
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,360
some of those concepts across other than

211
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,599
me yammering for 3 hours. Uh, and what

212
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,919
I'd like to do is revisit some of them,

213
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,759
but actually do um do do a bit of an of

214
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,639
an activity. I have never done this

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,880
before. Uh, so this is not tested. You

216
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,160
guys are the first iteration of

217
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,160
>> I feel

218
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
>> uh

219
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,080
>> but basically what we're going to do is

220
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,759
I'm going to go through these terms

221
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
again, explain it one more time. You

222
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,720
guys, you know, can ask me for

223
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,919
clarifications or anything and then

224
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,160
each, you know, group of about I think

225
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,560
two people. Uh we're going to pick a

226
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,039
game that somebody that pretty much

227
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,639
everyone in the class should sort of

228
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,919
know. They may not know the exact rules,

229
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,360
but they'll sort of know game. um and

230
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,000
sort of analyze that game across these

231
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,800
different uh these different axes. And

232
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
the idea of that is that if you get used

233
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
to this, then you can do that same thing

234
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,680
to your own game. And that may shed

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
light on how your game is balanced, how

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,240
your game is balanced, especially

237
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
between chance and skills, which is

238
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
really the topic of um of this class.

239
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,039
but also you know questions of you know

240
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,000
is our game doing what we want people uh

241
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:47,839
want our game to be doing. So that's

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,240
that's the general outline. Um, so, uh,

243
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,920
so there's one more thing I want to

244
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,839
mention before I go right into that.

245
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,160
And, uh, and I think and Jason actually

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
brought up a point at the end of, uh,

247
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,880
last Friday was that, uh, he noticed

248
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,279
that our two end robots, Mr. Robboto and

249
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,399
Badass Mofo 600,

250
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,519
>> 6010, I believe.

251
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,040
>> Yeah, 610. It was upgraded version.

252
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
He started at 608

253
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,120
>> and then there's a couple iterations on

254
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Saturday.

255
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,600
>> Um, one of them was purely deterministic

256
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,680
>> but horrendously complex in the sense

257
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,959
that uh horrendously complex not in the

258
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
sense that it was difficult to explain

259
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,080
what it was doing but difficult to

260
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,440
predict what it was going to do. Um you

261
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,320
know this this was the one that jumped

262
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,000
that had that that it will start its

263
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
turn order based on the number of hit

264
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,680
points that it had you know which

265
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,800
>> and take the number of moves based also

266
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,959
number of hit points it had

267
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,560
>> right so it's you know entirely

268
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,040
algorithmic you know it's just it's just

269
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,519
following its rules every single time um

270
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,440
the other one was pretty much random

271
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,279
right I mean who that was Mr. robot

272
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,760
which had a die roll every every round.

273
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,519
Uh and it just did something perfect

274
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,839
>> and and we ended up with the closest

275
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,160
fight of that day. I think you know um

276
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
and and that kind of does drive home the

277
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,200
point that you know at some point of

278
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,200
time you can get complexity through

279
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,440
purely deterministic rules

280
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,360
>> that frankly is as hard to predict as uh

281
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
pure as pure randomness.

282
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
>> A card game is like that.

283
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,600
>> Your card game is something like that.

284
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
But the nice thing about that is that if

285
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,720
you have deterministic, you can see why

286
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,560
it happened. You can see why. Wow. That

287
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,120
I I I didn't expect that to happen, but

288
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,640
I can see why that happened. Uh because

289
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,160
>> so he was going to win.

290
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
>> He was so sure he was going to win.

291
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,839
>> Yeah.

292
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
>> But then we Yeah.

293
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
>> Did not turn out as such.

294
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,440
>> So, you know, that's that's that's

295
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,279
that's a desirable trait. It's a lot

296
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,000
better than just saying, "Well, it's a

297
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,480
die roll." I mean the nice thing about

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,720
uh about virals is that it does take it

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,040
out of your control.

300
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,680
In fact it's it's kind of designed to

301
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,480
make it not skill-based and as a result

302
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,160
of that you give people who are lagging

303
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,160
who are having a harder time playing the

304
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,120
the game and entirely unskill based way

305
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,959
of catching up. Uh which is awesome um

306
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,279
if that's what you're going for. And

307
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,079
then the other one is you know if it's

308
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,000
if you just make it deterministic but

309
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,320
complex enough so the behavior is just

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
hard to predict but logical once it

311
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,640
actually happens then you know you kind

312
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,959
of get the same result and it all

313
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,360
balances out. Obviously Dals are really

314
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,600
easy to implement. Uh it's difficult to

315
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,040
actually come up with rules that

316
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
deterministically give you the kind of

317
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,600
complex behavior that you're looking

318
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,760
for. Um but it's a nice thing to go for.

319
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Of course, to get that complexity,

320
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,600
sometimes you need so many rules that

321
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
people just kind kind of get bored. It's

322
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
like, wow, this is really complicated.

323
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm not sure whether I can figure out

324
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,399
what the next step is going to be. And

325
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,240
then you just give up. That's kind of

326
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,480
the downside of, you know, really

327
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,720
complex determination behavior. Um,

328
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,040
but you know, it's it's it's neat that

329
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,279
that that that you kind of saw both of

330
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,240
those playing off each other and you saw

331
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,360
kind of them behaving in pretty much

332
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,680
unpredictable ways and yet giving nicely

333
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,920
balanced results. So they're both really

334
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,360
really valuable tools.

335
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Um, so now I'm going to be actually

336
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
deeply deeply plagiarizing from Salem

337
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,440
and from uh KB Salem and Eric Zimmerman

338
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,560
uh from uh Rules of Play, which is that

339
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,800
one of those big thick books I brought

340
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,959
in on the first day. Um I'm not making

341
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
you read it because I find that book

342
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
takes three pages to explain what could

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
have been explained in one which is why

344
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,200
I have why I have a whole bunch of

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,120
summaries in here. Uh but uh I am going

346
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,760
but but what what that book does do is

347
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,279
give you very very concrete terms that

348
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,279
are pretty well accepted um if not

349
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,760
necessarily among game designers among

350
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,279
people of various expert domains. Uh and

351
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,639
I've got some of those over there for

352
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,959
people for you to refer to. Um I touched

353
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,720
a little bit on information theory on on

354
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:09,440
Monday. that model of you know uh how a

355
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,680
signal goes from an uh someone who wants

356
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,399
to send it through a transmitter goes

357
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,720
through some sort of channel is received

358
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,800
through some sort of receiver to to a

359
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,200
person and and I talk if that

360
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,560
transmitter if the if a person want if

361
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,120
if the person who wants to send a signal

362
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,040
it's actually the game the game state uh

363
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
and is transferring information to a

364
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,680
player who needs to get information

365
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,440
about what's going on in the game um in

366
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,760
order to make a decision

367
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,519
uh then you can see how this applies to

368
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,519
game design. And in between you have

369
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,760
noise. You you you you have the thing

370
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,639
that prevents you from knowing exactly

371
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,000
what the game state is. And um and there

372
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,120
are c there are certain words that are

373
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,560
associated with with with that level of

374
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,200
of uncertainty. I mean uncertainty and

375
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,040
certainty are two are two words that

376
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,639
they suggest to begin with. Um

377
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,800
so

378
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,079
just one second.

379
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,480
So um so you know the uncertainty

380
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,480
includes both the

381
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,880
the the

382
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,120
your inability to know what's going to

383
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,399
happen next due to chance or due to

384
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,040
really complex behavior uh as you saw in

385
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,040
both of the robots. Uh it's just the

386
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,480
degree to which uh how much the game uh

387
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,480
all the different states the game could

388
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,639
take either maybe in the next turn or

389
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,399
throughout the entire play of the game.

390
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,800
Um

391
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,360
and uh and in information theory they

392
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,440
actually also use the word information

393
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
almost interchangeably. Uh unfortunately

394
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
this gets kind of confusion uh kind of

395
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,839
confusing because people don't actually

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,720
use the word information in that sense

397
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,320
in day-to-day life. And if and in fact

398
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
I'm going to propose a different way of

399
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
looking at it that also uses the word

400
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,360
information in a completely different

401
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,800
way. So I'm actually going to stop using

402
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,000
uh the word information for now. I'm

403
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,399
just going to call uh call it

404
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,320
uncertainty which is pretty much all the

405
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,199
different things that could happen in

406
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,199
the game you know uh either in the next

407
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,480
turn or or throughout the the game.

408
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,360
Certainty is the is the degree to which

409
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,240
you know uh you have knowledge about

410
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,240
what could have happened. you know, a

411
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,040
chess board pieces could be configured

412
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,600
in any position, but one move after the

413
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,360
opening, there's only a small set that

414
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
it could possibly that that that that

415
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,000
that uh that could possibly happen,

416
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,399
right? I mean, it's probably on the

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
order of only one side is moving for the

418
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,480
first time. Any one of the pawns could

419
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,199
move

420
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,800
>> 20

421
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,560
>> 20 Yeah, the knights could move. Yeah.

422
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,240
>> Yeah.

423
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,519
>> So, you know, there's only 20 20

424
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,240
different possible things. So, you know,

425
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,000
that's kind of the degree the degree of

426
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,560
certainty that you have among all the

427
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,720
different states, all the uncertainty of

428
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
this chessboard, you you are certain

429
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,959
that it's going to be limited to this

430
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,040
chunk. Um

431
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,399
and um

432
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,320
and your your your knowledge of what

433
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,199
that ratio

434
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,519
uh is of how much you know could be

435
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,600
happening based on what you know of the

436
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,680
game rules based on your experience of

437
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:24,320
the game uh based on uh your skill in

438
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,839
the game uh to the states that the game

439
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,240
could possibly take uh is called risk.

440
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,759
So um you can think of you can flip you

441
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,600
can flip it the other way around and say

442
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,240
that if the uncertainty of the first

443
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,639
turn is is you know 20 different moves

444
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,720
you know but you're certain that you

445
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,279
know the guy that you're that that that

446
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,279
oh say say I'm the opening player I'm

447
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,519
playing white and I really only know how

448
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,040
to make three of those openings

449
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,839
effective you know so I'm I I then then

450
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,279
then I then and if that person and the

451
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
person that I'm playing against knows

452
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,240
that really I only know three openings

453
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,000
really I only know two um you know then

454
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,360
then that person's degree of of risk is

455
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,199
kind of limited to the range of

456
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,439
possibilities that branch out of that

457
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,559
two out of 20

458
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,839
um so that's one way that you can sort

459
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,199
of describe risk um let me see whether

460
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:27,600
there's a more technical term that I can

461
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,600
describe that with the patient

462
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,320
So um so one thing that I want uh the

463
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,880
that I want you to think about later um

464
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:48,240
actually for for for the analysis that

465
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:54,720
we're going to to um to to do you I want

466
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:57,679
groups of two 4 6 8 10 12 14 15 mostly

467
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,000
groups two and one group of three. Um

468
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,000
actually one

469
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,200
actually let's just do groups of three.

470
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,360
It would be easier that way. Um and uh

471
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,760
and to think about you know pick a game

472
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,360
first that that you think that you can

473
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
probably mention in this class without

474
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,039
having to explain to everybody else

475
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,280
exactly how this game is played. Uh you

476
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,559
know uh it could be a computer game, it

477
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,880
could be a war game, it could be a card

478
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,520
game, something fairly wrong there. Um,

479
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,600
and I want you to think about okay in

480
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,679
you know what are the things that uh

481
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,160
what what what are all the variables

482
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,679
that you need to know in this game you

483
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,200
know uh do it in fairly simple terms you

484
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,720
know if you're doing something like a

485
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,880
game of uh cosmic encounter or something

486
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,960
then you know that's that you can say

487
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,799
that every single race has a unique

488
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,200
power without explaining to me every

489
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,480
single power uh and which is I think

490
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
they're likeundred different races in

491
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,160
the game. So that was cosplaying

492
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,480
encounter.

493
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,880
>> Oh, it's fun.

494
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,760
You will get a chance to play later this

495
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,919
this semester. So cool. Um let's see. Uh

496
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,360
so think think about what are all the

497
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
variables that you got to keep track of.

498
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,160
That's kind of the degree of

499
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,600
uncertainty. That's the amount of

500
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,559
information that could be in the system

501
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,320
in a way that Shannon and we were you

502
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,520
you you use it. That's all the different

503
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,360
range of possibilities, all the

504
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,760
different things you got to keep track.

505
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,720
What do you know for sure as a single

506
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,640
player in this game? Um, you know, what

507
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,320
do you know at your first turn and what,

508
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,000
you know, what what sort of information

509
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,600
do you tend to pick up along the way? Um

510
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,640
Um,

511
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,160
let's see. Yeah. So, so let's start with

512
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
that. We got, you know, just five

513
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
minutes. It doesn't have to be an

514
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,240
exhaustive list. So, let's split in just

515
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,240
groups of three.

516
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,520
the first activity and we're going to be

517
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,360
visiting every single one of

518
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,280
>> through all these different lenses. So

519
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm just going to start actually now and

520
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,880
you know uh and if we ran out of time to

521
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,960
do some uh uh uh this we can always do

522
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,640
it after class and we can talk about it

523
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,360
u but we're going to go through all of

524
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,120
them so I'm going to speak to this uh

525
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,120
starting with this team and moving all

526
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,679
the way over just talk about

527
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,360
>> Sure. So, we decided to go for Scrabble.

528
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,160
And so, in terms of variables, you have

529
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,840
the individual individual tiles. Their

530
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,120
tiles are uncertain. Yours are fairly

531
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,120
certain. The ones on the board are

532
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
certain because they're faced. So,

533
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
>> um

534
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
>> the ones that have been placed, you

535
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,200
mean?

536
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,400
>> Yes.

537
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,720
>> Yes. Another variable. Well, we're not I

538
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
guess the variable is the bonus squares

539
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,440
on the board.

540
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,480
>> Uh you can think of them as even though

541
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,080
they're fixed on the board, they're

542
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,600
variable in terms of as more tiles get

543
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,640
played, some of them become open and

544
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
some of them become closed, and you

545
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,480
don't know which ones are going to be

546
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,880
open and closed.

547
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,640
>> True. True. Um, also yes. Uh, yeah. All

548
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,240
right. Uh, so that's that's that's

549
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,720
something as you don't know how that's

550
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,360
going to to turn out during the middle

551
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,679
thing. So, one thing that's interesting

552
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,760
about word games, especially Scrabble

553
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,440
and crossword puzzles in general is that

554
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,440
a lot of them uh rely on the fact that

555
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
uh lang the English language in

556
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,000
particular is actually pretty redundant.

557
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,480
you can take about 50% of the letters

558
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,760
out from a word uh this fairly long word

559
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,440
and you can still figure out what it

560
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,360
means. Uh that works really well for

561
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,039
crossbow puzzles uh because you know you

562
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,559
get something like 25% of words you can

563
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,280
actually still figure out word what it

564
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,880
means especially if you got a clue. Um

565
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,600
but uh uh for Scrabble it also means

566
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,320
that it's now possible for you to make

567
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,080
uh connections between disperate uh

568
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,799
disperate characters. you can find a

569
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,480
word that's going to fit that. Um cuz

570
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,720
part of the problem uh actually um that

571
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
hasn't played words with friends.

572
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
>> Yeah.

573
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,320
>> Yeah. Okay. So, my brother,

574
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,039
>> it's online scramble basically, right?

575
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,919
You know. Oh, yeah.

576
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,760
>> Um

577
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,320
>> the same folks who made Worlds with

578
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,720
Friends made a game called Worlds with

579
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,760
Pirates.

580
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,640
>> And um and I I have a screenshot here of

581
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,480
a game I was playing yesterday. And uh

582
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,640
basically you have you have few way

583
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,640
fewer letters. You have H A R a lot of

584
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Rs

585
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,760
and exclamation mark.

586
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,760
>> So the number of letters that you can

587
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,960
get uh uh the quantity of the letters

588
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,480
that you get are the same as the

589
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,720
scrabble but the range of different

590
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,080
letters that you can get is way lower,

591
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,480
which means there actually a lot less

592
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:37,120
less uncertainties. Um,

593
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,600
and because the because the game has so

594
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,400
much um because this language, this

595
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,880
parent language has so much uh uh uh I I

596
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I I want to be very careful to use the

597
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,840
right word here.

598
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,840
>> Uh is it true?

599
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,159
>> So my so If I'm using the right word

600
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,320
here, the word that this is actually a

601
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:12,080
very non-redundant language because a r

602
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:14,720
is is a word a r r is a different word

603
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,799
both of which are valid. Um so there's

604
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,520
actually very little redundancy. uh you

605
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,679
know it's like I see eight R and I think

606
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,240
that could be any number of words

607
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,240
and as a result you notice that my that

608
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,880
this this this game of words with

609
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,679
pirates it results in an incredibly

610
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,120
dense world because I can fill in

611
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,159
whereas you can't do that with scrabble

612
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,320
scramble spaces go empty uh and get

613
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,480
locked out because you know unless you

614
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,320
have an incredible knowledge of scrabble

615
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
dictionary for the most

616
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,240
um you don't know those exploits that

617
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,159
are going to let you slice in an extra

618
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,760
character because most people's

619
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,640
knowledge of English

620
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,640
>> doesn't happen again.

621
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,679
>> So anyway, I thought that was

622
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
specifically useful for for illustration

623
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,960
at this point. Okay, so Scrabble. All

624
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,400
right, cool. Um next game.

625
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,559
>> So, uh we did go fish. So I mean some of

626
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,520
the of information we had were like

627
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,640
every player's hand and the um pile of

628
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,640
cards in the middle that you can

629
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,200
>> uh

630
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,760
uncertainty

631
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,240
>> being what cards the other player has

632
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,039
and the channel that comes out it is

633
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,400
them asking what cards they want and you

634
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,640
asking

635
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,080
>> them for cards, right? And there's noise

636
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,559
because just because they're asking for

637
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,600
a certain card can kind of imply what

638
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,520
they have in their hand, but doesn't

639
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,960
necessarily tell you what don't have,

640
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,120
>> right? It only tells you what they don't

641
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,320
have in their hands. Sometimes it tells

642
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,880
you what they don't have in their hands.

643
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,159
Sometimes it they they give you a card

644
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,000
and I forget the rules. Do you have if

645
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,520
you have multiple threes and someone

646
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
says, "Got any threes?"

647
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,799
>> You give all three.

648
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,960
>> Yeah.

649
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,159
>> Yeah. Okay. So, so, so you

650
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,760
>> Why would you have three threes? Why

651
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,400
don't you just put a pair down?

652
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,919
>> Yeah. That would just be dumb.

653
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
>> I mean, you're a bad player.

654
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,039
>> Yeah.

655
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,039
>> But for the most part, you know, in in

656
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,720
in that game, um that's your one channel

657
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,720
finding out what the state of the game

658
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,240
is. Uh the game state is what everybody

659
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,559
has has at hand.

660
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,080
>> Cool. Cool. Cool.

661
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,520
>> Uh Mario Kart.

662
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
>> Mhm.

663
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,000
>> Sweet.

664
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,080
>> Yeah. There's a lot of there's a lot of

665
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,600
uncertain a lot of things to keep track

666
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,120
of. So the things that you can't

667
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,520
possibly keep track of but that are

668
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,640
really important to the game are uh you

669
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,640
know what's what's going to come up when

670
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,440
you hit an item block and what items

671
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,360
people around you have. So you might

672
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,799
think it's safe to like bump another

673
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,240
player, but if they have three green

674
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,559
shells, they can activate that then and

675
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,919
blast you out of the map. Um

676
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,520
>> another one is like what position you're

677
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,880
in because if you're first place, you

678
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,559
know, the blue shell hits you. So it's

679
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,400
also what position you're in, what

680
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,440
position people are in, stuff like that,

681
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,200
>> right? So,

682
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,480
>> so the probability of being hit by a

683
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
blue shell is way higher when you're

684
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
number one.

685
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,159
>> Yeah.

686
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,760
>> Okay. So, you gather information through

687
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,600
your visual range, which is also a

688
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,320
function of basically where you are in

689
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,840
the map.

690
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,600
>> And so, the information you're getting

691
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
about other players,

692
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,880
>> uh, depends on where you are. And

693
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
interestingly, you know, if they're

694
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,520
immediately in front of you, you have a

695
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,640
lot more information than if they're

696
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,159
behind you, you have a lot more

697
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
information than if they're way far away

698
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,159
from you,

699
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,440
>> right? Because if they're behind you or

700
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,039
they're way far away from you, you don't

701
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,200
know what what weapons they've got

702
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,600
equipped for you. for instance, you

703
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,120
generally know what position other

704
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,600
people are in,

705
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,360
>> but that's all you got, you know. Uh so

706
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,480
that's that's some uh

707
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
>> and then there's different paths and

708
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,799
levels. So you might think there's

709
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
someone in the same position as you, but

710
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,159
they're not at the same point because

711
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,760
they take a different branch. And then

712
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
there's also the varying capabilities of

713
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,480
different cars. So in Mario Kart 64, if

714
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,559
you take Bowser and you're playing and

715
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,279
there's Toad, you can ram into Toad and

716
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,480
Toad will go like flying.

717
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,679
>> Bowser.

718
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,279
>> Yeah.

719
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:08,080
So many one element of risk uh that you

720
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:10,960
get in uh in uh Mario Kart is that the

721
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,840
kinds of weapons that you get are pretty

722
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,919
much weighted based on where you are in

723
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,760
the game. If you are at the back, you

724
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,240
get all the awesome weapons because the

725
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,799
game

726
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,520
>> you get a star like Disney Racer on

727
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,080
PlayStation was way more weighted than

728
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,880
that.

729
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,480
>> Sure, there are more obvious versions of

730
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,120
of this. I think Super Monkey Ball does

731
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,320
this too actually. Um, when you're right

732
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,400
in the front, I think all you get are

733
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,279
bananas. Is that is that that the only

734
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,320
>> in parts?

735
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,960
>> Mostly bananas and like one green shell.

736
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,679
>> Yeah,

737
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,600
>> that's pretty much it.

738
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
>> You get you get a file jump,

739
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
>> but also the fake mystery box.

740
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,559
>> Yeah.

741
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,440
>> And then halfway through uh and halfway

742
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,159
games, the waiting is I'm going to guess

743
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,520
roughly linear. So the basic idea is of

744
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,039
one of the things about risk is that

745
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,600
every time you take up a new weapon, you

746
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,640
you are basically taking a gamble about

747
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,159
what you're going to get. If you're

748
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
already holding a weapon,

749
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,399
>> yeah,

750
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,840
>> sometimes you can choose to discard that

751
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,760
to pick up something new. And I believe

752
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,399
later iteration you carry two weapons or

753
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,399
something like that. Um so you know

754
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,640
that's one element of of risk, right?

755
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,480
What do I know? I know what I've got.

756
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,480
You know what what what else do I know?

757
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,559
I know what position I I'm in. And I

758
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,279
know that if I run into this box right

759
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,679
now and I got rid of what I had, I could

760
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,600
pick up a cooler weapon,

761
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,799
there's a probability associated with

762
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,039
that. And you know, and that's the other

763
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,679
risk. You know, it's like you kind of

764
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,159
it's it's like a one way to think of it

765
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,840
is that it is a certain outcome with a

766
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,440
certain probability associated. You are

767
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,279
going to get away with it. It might be

768
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
crap.

769
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,799
>> You only really gain a sense of hardware

770
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,559
though from like experience

771
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,320
>> playing with it. Yeah, it's one of those

772
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,679
things where your certainty of this game

773
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,440
goes out west the more you play. Yeah.

774
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,640
>> Cool. Thanks.

775
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,840
>> So we beat Monopoly.

776
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,720
>> Sure.

777
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,120
>> So

778
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,279
uh so Monopoly basically u what's

779
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,600
certain is who owns what property

780
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,279
essentially and it's technically certain

781
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,960
how much money everyone has though

782
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,039
keeping track of all that information on

783
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,399
a term basis can be difficult. So there

784
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,000
is a little bit of relative uncertainty

785
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,880
just due to the quantity of information

786
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,840
there

787
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,600
>> and uh yes you gain uncertainties. It's

788
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,399
actually Monopoly has very different

789
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,080
opening and end games essentially. Um

790
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,720
towards the start of the game there's a

791
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,200
lot of uncertainty about how other

792
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,520
players are going to value property that

793
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,279
you give up. As Bowen was telling me I

794
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,799
wasn't even aware of this in Monopoly

795
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,880
when you decide not to purchase a

796
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,520
property it actually goes up to auction.

797
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,039
Yeah,

798
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,559
>> that's like most people that

799
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,360
>> and it's an open auction and so you

800
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,039
don't know what other people's

801
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
valuations are. So each time you bid,

802
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,720
you're taking a risk

803
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,760
>> if you don't actually want that price.

804
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,960
>> That makes the game actually more

805
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,679
interesting.

806
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,360
>> Oh yeah.

807
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,679
>> It turns out it turns out the game is

808
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,760
not that much more interesting

809
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,640
>> even when you even when you have the the

810
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,360
option system.

811
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,240
>> We will get to

812
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,520
>> still pretty boring.

813
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,520
>> We will get to

814
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,679
you see my degenerate strategies. We

815
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
will get to that.

816
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
It's the end of the game. Basically,

817
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,120
it's also a lot of uncertainty about

818
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,240
what players are going to be, well,

819
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
these aren't part of the rules, but

820
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,039
whether they're going to be willing to

821
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,679
trade with you, whether you can, you

822
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,440
know, do things like manage to get into

823
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,840
jail so you can stop landing on people's

824
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,600
properties, kind of thing. Chances, of

825
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,520
course, another level of uncertainty

826
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,559
there. So,

827
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,360
>> yeah. Uh it it's weird about the risk

828
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,159
associated with an auction because

829
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,480
>> you kind of know

830
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
the sort of

831
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,440
especially in the early game you have a

832
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,200
vague idea of how much people could

833
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,720
possibly bid on this, right? You know,

834
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,600
it's like not not more than the amount

835
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,039
of money that they have or needing a

836
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,360
mortgage or something that they have

837
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,880
just to get the cash for an auction. But

838
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,120
it's um but it's it's it's one of those

839
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,080
things that you know would fatty bill.

840
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,919
Uh so it's true.

841
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,039
Okay. All right.

842
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,039
>> So we chose chess

843
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,480
and so

844
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,880
chess has this no uncertainty in the

845
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,559
game because the if I would say any

846
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,120
uncertainty it would be you don't know

847
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,279
what your opponent is going to do. Mhm.

848
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,200
>> So you have to make a move assuming that

849
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,039
he's going to do something he can do

850
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,919
something completely different.

851
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,240
>> And as well as like risk in the game,

852
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,679
>> the only risk is also not knowing what

853
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,080
your opponent's going to do. So he could

854
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,559
do a series of moves which causes you to

855
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,559
be in situation where you have to lose

856
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,559
piece.

857
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,360
>> Yeah.

858
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,880
>> Yeah, that's pretty much it.

859
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,120
>> No, no, that's that that's cool. Um, I

860
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,159
would argue that not knowing what your

861
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,720
player is capable of is deep

862
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,120
uncertainty. And in fact, it's it's it's

863
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,200
a huge amount of of of uncertainty in

864
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,000
game. It's true that, you know, the way

865
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,679
how the pieces move are and where the p

866
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
the pieces are placed, you know,

867
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,880
everyone knows that. Uh, everyone want

868
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,559
to get a mixed one. It's a game of

869
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,440
perfect information. The game state is

870
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,519
low noise. you know, you you you know

871
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,799
exactly what's going in the game unless

872
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,240
you're playing with like a 5-year-old

873
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,360
who doesn't put the piece right down in

874
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,519
the square, you know. Um

875
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,399
>> so I guess something where it'd be a lot

876
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,519
more a lot more noise for the game would

877
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,519
be if you're playing something like

878
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,960
speed test because then it's like oh you

879
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,880
just have to think fast and

880
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,679
>> sure it's a lot harder to realize what's

881
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,080
going on.

882
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,559
>> Yeah, that that is true because then now

883
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,880
now you're limited by your own cognitive

884
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,720
u bandwidth, right? you know, uh, so

885
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
that's true, but it it doesn't change

886
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,360
the amount of uncertainty in the game.

887
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,120
The uncertainty on the game really is

888
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,360
your opponent and what's in that

889
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,360
person's head, uh, you know, the

890
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,360
knowledge of of openings and knowledge

891
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,360
of different moves, whether that player

892
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,640
has seen something that you haven't

893
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,080
seen, uh, or, you know, those of counter

894
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,360
that that that you always annoying.

895
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,880
>> Always annoying. You get the impression

896
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,000
that they know exactly how to counter

897
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
what you're doing and you're kind of

898
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,200
floating like,

899
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,720
>> right, right, right. Sometimes you're

900
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,279
counting on them to do something and

901
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,360
then you don't. It's like, well, did you

902
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,720
do that? I would have done that.

903
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,440
>> I think it's like golf where you have to

904
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,679
pretend like you really look like

905
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,320
poker.

906
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,799
>> Um, okay. So, so you know that that's

907
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,519
one way to look at your your game. What

908
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,600
do you know? What do you don't uh don't

909
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,720
don't know. What's the probability that

910
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,679
you uh what's what's the probability of

911
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,159
certainty that you know something? Um,

912
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,760
and of course I'm not not as you what as

913
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,600
as a game designer you're thinking what

914
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,519
do your players know? What your players

915
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,320
not know? What can your players do? A

916
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,960
reasoned a reasonable guess of what

917
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,640
likelihood something is going to happen

918
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,000
um or something is going to be true. You

919
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,840
know, it's like, okay, I don't know how

920
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,919
what cars that person has, but I but

921
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,480
there's an 80% probability that that

922
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:09,200
person has jacks of higher off the of

923
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:12,000
the of the the trump because that person

924
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,960
bid on that trump. That's that that

925
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,320
that's a fairly good good guess. Um

926
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,839
lowrisk guess. Okay. Now, now we're

927
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,879
going to the other schema which is the

928
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,800
information systems. Um now I talked a

929
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,399
little bit about perfect and Imperfect

930
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,919
information. Perfect information games.

931
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,919
You know games state. Everyone knows

932
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,119
game state. No player does not know game

933
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,480
state. Um imperfect information. Okay,

934
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,480
there's something that you don't know.

935
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Maybe it's you know card games in

936
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,879
particular because cards have two sides.

937
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,240
You know that's cards are t typically

938
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,760
used to hold back the perfect

939
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,760
information. Anyone play strategy

940
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,599
in perfect information any you know

941
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,119
every single piece. There's nothing

942
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,079
random in the entire game. There are no

943
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,800
dy rolls, you know, there are no random

944
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,320
shuffles.

945
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,160
>> Well, the other guy chooses to

946
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,520
click where he places his pieces. It can

947
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,200
be perceived as random to you.

948
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,400
>> Can be perceived as random. It is true.

949
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,119
It is. But it I mean but but but but uh

950
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,520
let's get really uh uh specific about

951
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,200
termin is that it's actually uncertain.

952
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,839
It's not actually random. It is a

953
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:28,480
decision made by not play by rules. Um

954
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:31,839
so yeah. So actually one objectively

955
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,079
like it is not random. It is perceived

956
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,000
as random. Uh it's perceived as

957
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,280
effectively right because really the

958
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,359
person could have put his pieces

959
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,200
anywhere within I think the first two

960
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:48,720
rows or something like that. Um

961
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:50,240
so so so um how however that's that's

962
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,320
kind of a blood tool. This is game and

963
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,839
game of perfect information or imperfect

964
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,200
information. That's a yes no question.

965
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,040
doesn't really tell you that much about

966
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,800
your your

967
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,839
your asking okay what is actually random

968
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,760
and what is not actually uh random but

969
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,520
may be perceived as that slightly better

970
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,960
question you know uh because you can

971
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,400
think okay if if I as a player I know

972
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
that's not random but it could be

973
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,359
anything

974
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,440
uh because of what the other player has

975
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,280
done I'm going to treat it as random I

976
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,800
might as well do all and when you're

977
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,079
designing for that player you are you

978
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,760
are doing all your calculations just

979
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
taking it as random

980
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,400
Um

981
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,240
there might be um uh there is a game

982
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,960
theorist not game theorist a game

983
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,440
studies uh uh scholar named Cia Pierce

984
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,400
who works over at Georgia Tech and her

985
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,400
proposal is that u a more useful range

986
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,800
of questions to ask would be what's

987
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,240
known to all players you know and in

988
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,400
game of perfect information everything's

989
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,440
known to all players uh what's only

990
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,079
known to one player what's known to the

991
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,079
game you know is like uh especially for

992
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,240
a computer game computer knows game

993
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,920
knows a lot more about game state. But

994
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,560
that sometimes that even comes down to

995
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,000
rules. So if you've ever done boss

996
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,760
battles in something like Metroid or

997
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,119
Castlevania for instance, there are

998
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,599
rules of which every that every single

999
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,599
boss is going to react to anything that

1000
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,839
you do. Maybe it's based on time. Maybe

1001
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,839
it's just a sequence of actions or like

1002
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,680
the robots that you like the AI giant

1003
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,079
robot that you guys programmed uh in

1004
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,000
person. You don't know those rules going

1005
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,280
into the game. that's those doesn't

1006
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,560
prevent you from playing the game. And

1007
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,760
in fact, part of the fun is figuring out

1008
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,480
what that rules is, figuring out what

1009
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
the pattern is against. Um, so that's an

1010
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,440
example of the thing that's known to the

1011
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,359
game. Other things that are known to the

1012
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,359
game are

1013
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,359
um

1014
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,720
actually now maybe that's not that's not

1015
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,560
a good example because randomly

1016
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,800
generated stuff like there is a shuffle

1017
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,800
deck. Uh shuffled decks are kind of one

1018
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:54,000
of those things where it's a little bit

1019
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,160
unclear uh about what whether the game

1020
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,920
knows what's in that stack. It's true

1021
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,640
that you shuffled it. So, it's randomly

1022
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,680
generated, but once you've shuffled it,

1023
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,160
it is now in a fixed order. Uh so the

1024
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,520
game knows what order that that that

1025
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
message even though it was initially

1026
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,920
randomly generated. It's not like

1027
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,960
randomly generated every single turn

1028
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,359
like a di. Um but you know, it's a good

1029
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,200
question to ask. you know, uh even if

1030
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,720
it's not an easy question to answer,

1031
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,040
it's a good question to ask what's known

1032
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,720
to the game but not known to the rest of

1033
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,160
players and what's just randomly

1034
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,160
generated. You know, it's like, you

1035
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,400
know, even if the game had a brain, they

1036
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,240
would have no idea what this game's ter

1037
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,000
because it's a freaking title. Um, so

1038
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,079
use those games again. Every single one

1039
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,760
of those games they're talking about

1040
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,359
what's what's known to all players,

1041
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,880
what's known to one player, what's known

1042
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,160
to the game, and what's just randomly

1043
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,160
generated. Go.

1044
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Okay.

1045
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,280
Every single game detail

1046
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,480
should we just do?

1047
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:08,040
>> So we changed again poker Texas Holdm

1048
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,040
now. So no longer in chess and so

1049
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,040
it's kind of it's imperfect information

1050
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,960
because you know what's in your hand,

1051
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,960
you know what's out on the board, but

1052
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,480
you have no idea what everyone anyone

1053
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,119
else has. They can try and tricky. So

1054
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,440
it's maybe perceived. It's perceived

1055
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,760
knowledge. So uh like let's say they

1056
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,200
play a large bet. It's perceived that

1057
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,119
they must have a good hand, but it's not

1058
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,079
necessarily

1059
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,000
accurate. So it's it's not really an

1060
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,839
objective based. However, it is

1061
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,240
subjective. Whenever you finally show

1062
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,200
your hands, then it's either you want

1063
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,200
one or you lost. It's not really up for

1064
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
debate.

1065
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,640
>> So I guess it could also be uh whether

1066
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,400
you know like again with chess how you

1067
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,760
what what the other player knows whether

1068
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,400
uh the other players know like

1069
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,839
conventional poker conventions for

1070
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,280
>> for folding or not.

1071
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,839
>> Mhm.

1072
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,079
Okay. Um

1073
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,560
let's see other things. Other things

1074
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,480
that a lot of uh Korean especially poker

1075
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,640
uh there that is known to all players

1076
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,640
will be things like what are the number

1077
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,359
of kings in the deck you know what are

1078
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,040
number uh you know what are what are the

1079
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,800
forces and what are all different hands

1080
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,800
that that that you could make and what

1081
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,640
are the point values. So that's just one

1082
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,400
example of things that need to be known

1083
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,839
by all players. Well, that the

1084
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,079
assumption that all players know that.

1085
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,480
Sometimes all players don't know all

1086
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,520
>> like memorizing the probabilities is a

1087
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,119
huge

1088
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,200
>> really big players know the objective

1089
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,640
probabilities of a given hand.

1090
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,440
>> Yeah, actually a lot of casinos they let

1091
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,800
you bring in a card with the

1092
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,720
probabilities. You can

1093
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,240
>> really

1094
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,280
>> I'm surprised that they let you do that.

1095
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,960
Okay. All right.

1096
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,480
>> I guess I guess blackjack.

1097
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,280
>> I'm pretty sure blackjack too you can

1098
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,000
bring in cards with numbers on. So, you

1099
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,920
know, um you know that the the themes

1100
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,119
that are known to the game would be, of

1101
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,560
course, you know, shuffle order. Uh

1102
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,000
I guess this happens more in blackjack

1103
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,440
where you've got like five decks all

1104
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,560
shuffled together and you know, you

1105
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,400
know, there are certain number of kings

1106
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,599
in and they're in there somewhere. So,

1107
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,640
if all the kings get played out, you're

1108
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,160
going to have no more kings left in

1109
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,000
there and then you can you can you can

1110
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,319
sort of do do computations from them. Um

1111
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,560
and uh one thing I want to clarify about

1112
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,720
objective and proceed. Um objective

1113
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,720
doesn't necessarily mean that any one

1114
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,480
player knows whether this is good or

1115
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,240
bad. Uh the idea is that if if there was

1116
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,000
a third party observer who was not

1117
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,920
playing the game and knew all of game

1118
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
state, you know, look into the deck to

1119
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,319
look into the hands, you know, uh knows

1120
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,680
what's coming up or a computer running

1121
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,240
the game that that person that computer

1122
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,920
will know to the the extent to where

1123
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,040
something is good or bad. So if you get

1124
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,119
a hand, you know, um probabilistically

1125
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,440
you can sort of tell, well, this is a

1126
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,079
pretty darn good hand or this is this is

1127
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,280
already probabilistically crappy.

1128
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,040
>> I got cheap enough suits.

1129
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,520
>> It might be good for that game, right?

1130
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,280
It might it might be just like I I don't

1131
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,280
care, you know, but it might be good if

1132
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,920
nobody else has anything, you know, but

1133
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,920
uh

1134
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,760
>> probability you're not going to have it.

1135
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,040
>> Yeah, but but pro probabilistically you

1136
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
want to win that. That's why you have

1137
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,920
pro players saying things like right up

1138
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,440
until this point I was winning, you

1139
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,359
know, and then you know and then you

1140
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,480
lost the entire game. But it's like

1141
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,880
probabilistically they were doing

1142
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,960
everything right. And and actually

1143
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,920
that's a lot of professional players

1144
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,200
have those strategies to uh to say well

1145
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,560
they were doing everything right. Sure

1146
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,560
they they lost the hand but to them they

1147
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,040
were winning they were winning

1148
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,720
everywhere up up to the point where they

1149
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,440
fold. Uh okay next game

1150
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,839
Monopoly game let's run through the all

1151
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,079
players one player game etc.

1152
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,359
>> Uh all players know the board state. So

1153
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,720
the people that are owners of any of the

1154
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,079
properties and what's still owned by the

1155
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,319
bank. Um

1156
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,240
everybody so

1157
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,000
every given player knows the amount of

1158
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,680
money that they have and also what

1159
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
valuation they place on all of their

1160
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,680
properties which is not known to other

1161
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,720
people except kind of incidentally

1162
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,760
through their actions. Uh the game knows

1163
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,520
the state of the community chance and

1164
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
sorry community chance and chance decks,

1165
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
right?

1166
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,839
>> And then there's randomly generated die

1167
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,760
rolls.

1168
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,440
>> Die rolls.

1169
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,000
>> I I I I'm forgetting whether uh Monopoly

1170
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,800
requires you to show your bankroll

1171
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,280
clearly.

1172
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,040
>> I think so.

1173
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,720
>> If you want to know how much money

1174
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,880
someone else has,

1175
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,560
>> they have to tell you.

1176
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,319
>> It would be interesting to look up and

1177
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,880
see uh what the actual. Cool. All right.

1178
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,079
So popular

1179
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,839
>> good marketing.

1180
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,599
>> It's very shallow.

1181
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,200
>> So it's really it's really familiar. I

1182
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,000
know I've so I asked friends of mine who

1183
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,520
have to play Monopoly but don't like to

1184
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,160
play for instance settlers. And um a lot

1185
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,240
of it is really you don't have to think

1186
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,640
too much about it. It's just an excuse

1187
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,640
to sit around and talk with people. Um

1188
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,520
there's there's um not that much that

1189
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,280
kind of distinguishes somebody who's

1190
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,280
like a incredibly good player from an

1191
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,440
incredibly bad player. It's has that bit

1192
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,280
of that any given Sunday feel to it. So

1193
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,119
you always have an opportunity to win

1194
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
there can be dramatic swings of faith

1195
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,200
and all that kind of thing.

1196
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,319
>> So it's kind of like adult candy

1197
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,000
can you just go through the motions.

1198
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,520
>> Yeah. But I mean, I also have friends

1199
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,040
who are like avid Monopoly players and I

1200
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,560
really believe that there's a deep skill

1201
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,280
to playing Monopoly, but I'm yet to be

1202
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,960
convinced.

1203
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,920
>> There is a strategy. I'm not sure it is

1204
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,319
a skill.

1205
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,760
>> Okay. All right. Cool. Thanks.

1206
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,040
>> We need Mario.

1207
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,680
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sticking with

1208
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,079
the game.

1209
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,800
>> So, except for a couple of special

1210
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,119
stages in general, players are aware of

1211
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,119
their welcome position other players um

1212
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,960
during the race. We assume everyone

1213
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,520
knows the maps. You play them. So, we

1214
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,599
assume everyone knows the maps.

1215
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,520
You're not sure if you know what other

1216
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,839
people like what their special powerups

1217
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,520
are and you can like look at the screen

1218
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,560
and see what they have.

1219
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,560
>> Yeah. So, if you're playing against

1220
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,920
other humans, there are situations where

1221
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,000
you definitely know what they have. I

1222
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,000
don't think

1223
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,440
>> it's a strategy.

1224
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,880
>> In Mario Kart DS, you know all your

1225
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,720
opponent's items.

1226
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,720
>> Yeah, that's true. That's lame.

1227
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,000
>> Suddenly on a on a simultaneous

1228
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,920
multiplayer game where your screen is

1229
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
divided into four or two.

1230
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,920
>> Yeah. You know what your opponent has

1231
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,960
and designers have to take that into

1232
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,560
account.

1233
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,440
>> Same thing for Halo, right?

1234
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,800
>> Yeah. Talking about just said it. You

1235
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,480
said counteract.

1236
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,200
>> Yeah. Um and let's see what else. Uh so

1237
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,240
there's um you perceive it as kind, I

1238
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,680
guess, completely random, especially if

1239
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,440
you don't pay much attention to it, but

1240
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,680
it's more like weighted random what

1241
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,880
items you get. And so that's something

1242
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,040
that you might figure out as you go

1243
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,680
along that actually as you're further up

1244
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,040
uh you you get worse items. I in fact

1245
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,040
it's a good strategy in that game to

1246
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,119
remain second place for most of the race

1247
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,400
and then and then go to first. You don't

1248
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,920
really want to be in first place.

1249
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,160
>> Now the game knows those probability

1250
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,440
rates.

1251
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,880
>> The game definitely knows that. The game

1252
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,880
also knows who's going to get hit by a

1253
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,119
red shell for example when you launch

1254
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,400
it. It's not entirely clear to me as a

1255
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,400
player when there's multiple people in

1256
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,560
front of me who's going to pick

1257
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,400
>> um when I shoot a green shell be back

1258
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,160
behind me.

1259
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,079
You know, the game knows what's going

1260
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,920
on. I I know. Is that in my field of

1261
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,079
view? I might hear it. I might hear the

1262
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,359
result. I might not.

1263
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,960
>> The game definitely understands the

1264
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,680
physics way better than any human player

1265
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,000
could possibly.

1266
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,480
>> Yeah. Yeah. For sure. For sure.

1267
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,920
>> Yeah.

1268
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,079
>> Yeah.

1269
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,440
>> The game knows all the players positions

1270
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,040
and abilities, but it doesn't know what

1271
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,680
they're going to do or how they're going

1272
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,480
to interact with each other. It also

1273
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,079
doesn't presumably actually know uh what

1274
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,079
items are coming up.

1275
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,839
>> Oh, and then another thing is as players

1276
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:02,880
you can learn the patterns of some of

1277
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,280
the of the hazards and and and be able

1278
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,800
to be able to predict which way to go

1279
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,359
depending on when you where how you know

1280
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,560
a certain

1281
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,200
>> that's like knowing a map, right? That's

1282
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,400
like knowing.

1283
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,880
>> Yeah. What if any of them are random?

1284
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,160
Actually,

1285
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,760
>> depends.

1286
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,440
>> Some of them are random. But uh one

1287
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,319
thing to keep in mind about randomly

1288
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,000
generated computers obviously uh well

1289
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,119
maybe not it's not obvious but uh

1290
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,359
computers actually have a real tough

1291
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,640
time generating really random numbers.

1292
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,319
>> It's a pseudo random

1293
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,359
>> is they could that's why they're called

1294
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:31,280
pseudo random. Uh so so to some extent

1295
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,680
the computer knows but it's trying

1296
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,680
really really hard not to know that

1297
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,680
coming up but it's really really useful

1298
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,240
if you ever go into game design uh for

1299
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,079
digital games uh to use that to your

1300
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,720
advantage because you can use that to

1301
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,200
reproduce problematic situations. Uh

1302
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,760
it's like yeah random number generator

1303
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,440
that we have absolute control over uh

1304
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,599
and you use that to uh to your advantage

1305
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,560
when you're trying to find bugs.

1306
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,480
>> Cool. Thanks. Um, so just remind we did

1307
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,720
go fish. So I mean clearly every player

1308
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,119
knows what's in his hand, knows what

1309
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,640
pairs have been played thus far, knows

1310
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,640
how many cards people have and stuff

1311
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,599
like that. Um,

1312
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,119
>> generally people should know what cards

1313
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,599
have been given from one player to

1314
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,359
another player. They might have

1315
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:20,079
forgotten that. Um

1316
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,680
sometimes there's a situation where uh

1317
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,839
most of the players don't know which

1318
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,480
pairs can be possibly made at a given

1319
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,480
point.

1320
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,000
>> Sometimes one player may know that

1321
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,520
because he might have one card that

1322
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,160
someone else gave their card to somebody

1323
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,079
else

1324
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,680
>> or something like this. But the game

1325
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,119
definitely knows this.

1326
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,559
>> Um also the order of the deck is random.

1327
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,400
>> Yeah.

1328
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,200
>> At least right at the beginning first.

1329
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,240
Yeah.

1330
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,920
>> Cool. So for Scrabble, all the players

1331
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,200
know the pieces on the board. They all

1332
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,640
know the letter frequencies.

1333
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,680
>> They don't know what tiles you're going

1334
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,280
to get next. The bag is random graph.

1335
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,880
>> What does everyone know the dictionary

1336
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,280
though? Like the dictionary knows it.

1337
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,280
>> I mean that that's the knowledge that is

1338
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,280
both available to one player and to the

1339
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,440
game. Technically the game has official

1340
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,040
Scrabble dictionary. uh if you're

1341
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,359
playing a digital version then they're

1342
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,240
probably using it. Uh you're playing

1343
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,760
against your family, they probably don't

1344
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,559
accept, you know, certain two letter

1345
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,319
words

1346
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,880
in the dictionary.

1347
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,040
>> Um

1348
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,480
>> we also don't know like what the other

1349
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,559
players have like,

1350
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,720
>> right? So one person only knows like

1351
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,160
what they have, but then like the other

1352
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,200
three aren't really. But then again,

1353
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,720
towards the end of the game, we

1354
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,359
discussed how if you're playing with two

1355
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,200
people, you can probabilistically figure

1356
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,480
out what they

1357
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,599
>> or figure out what you're going to get

1358
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,040
next when you draw.

1359
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,359
>> It's also more likely for you to figure

1360
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,200
out as as the game goes on and piles get

1361
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,440
clear, what letters will never come up.

1362
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,960
>> At pro at pro levels of Scrabble, they

1363
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,240
do know exactly what final steps, right?

1364
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,240
There's a there's like a certain point

1365
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,720
that you get to at which point Scrabble

1366
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,119
players just know what's left and work

1367
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,480
out kind of all the possible.

1368
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,319
>> At that point, do you just like keep

1369
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,000
letters that are more likely to work

1370
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:09,760
with what's in the bag? Like how does

1371
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,960
how do you use that to your advantage?

1372
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,960
>> After all the files drawn, you know,

1373
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,240
>> yeah, you're trying to prevent them from

1374
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,040
using the letters that they've got. Uh

1375
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,400
but if you uh most scramble boards uh

1376
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,319
although I don't know if all scramble

1377
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,920
boards have this they actually show the

1378
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:30,240
frequency in which a number of uh the

1379
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,640
number of letters the number of tiles

1380
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,400
for any given letter are in there. So

1381
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,079
it's actually expected that you're going

1382
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,000
to take this into account. It's like oh

1383
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,599
four you know there are only four hes or

1384
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,920
something like that and they're all out.

1385
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,559
All right there's none coming down.

1386
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,760
>> Random other Scrabble facts. found out a

1387
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,400
lot about Scrabble when I was reading

1388
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,079
about computational Scrabble planes.

1389
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,760
Apparently in Scrabble tournaments,

1390
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,599
people like they have a chess clock

1391
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,119
system, right, for making sure it

1392
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,040
doesn't go over time. And apparently

1393
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,960
people set aside like half their time to

1394
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,640
playing the end game of Scrabble,

1395
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,559
>> which is the point at which at which

1396
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,400
there's basically full information

1397
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,920
>> and then you're just sitting there out

1398
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,760
like

1399
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,359
what the best sequence of play is to

1400
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,839
beat your opponent and it becomes like

1401
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,839
chess.

1402
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,559
How much time do you get on the test?

1403
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,559
>> I don't even remember.

1404
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,960
>> So yeah, high level Scrabble is

1405
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,119
completely different from the Scrabble

1406
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,920
when you play. It's crazy.

1407
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,920
>> I'd love to find a video.

1408
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:35,359
>> Okay. All right. Uh still got some time.

1409
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Great. Uh let's talk about cybernetics.

1410
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:42,160
um cybernetics are you know given that I

1411
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,319
kind of invented at MIT uh is something

1412
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,520
that you probably encountered and I' we

1413
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,359
mentioned this a few times the whole

1414
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,640
idea of feedback I want to break this

1415
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:55,040
down a little bit though uh because

1416
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:57,119
um feedback works uh the the official

1417
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,880
sense of feedbacks in the sort of theory

1418
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,079
of cybernetic systems as written by

1419
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,000
Robert weer back in the 40s I think um

1420
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,200
is that there is a sensor something

1421
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,200
which measures

1422
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,240
what the system is doing. There is a

1423
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:13,359
comp there's a comparator which is

1424
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,000
in his era was a machine and in our era

1425
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,480
is probably a rule a logic a statement

1426
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,720
uh you know you know that that that that

1427
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,880
compares this against some sort of uh

1428
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,400
set value or some sort of rule and

1429
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,400
decides to take action um and activate

1430
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,960
and you can think of this this way all

1431
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,880
as you know your sensor is the variable

1432
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,000
that you're looking at or a certain

1433
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,920
collection of variables that you're

1434
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,280
looking at. So, what are you looking at?

1435
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,200
A comparator is a rule that you're

1436
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,200
comparing against. Uh, you know, it's um

1437
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,480
I'm trying to pick a game that no one

1438
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:51,599
has mentioned here so far

1439
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:56,079
uh that has a good feedback system.

1440
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:58,240
Say, um I I I played a version of cops

1441
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,319
and robbers as a kid where every time

1442
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,079
you c you the cop caught a robber, the

1443
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,760
robber would have to go into a jail area

1444
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,839
and couldn't get out of it. to someone

1445
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,559
tagged him, someone from the robber team

1446
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,240
tag them. Uh, and the basic idea is that

1447
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,599
the fewer people there are in a field,

1448
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,760
assuming they are playing in a fixed

1449
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,440
space. The more robbers there are in a

1450
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,000
jail, the easier it is for a robber to

1451
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,599
run uh uh actually because they have

1452
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,160
more freedom. Sure, there are more cops

1453
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,160
to any given robber so they can do uh

1454
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,599
kind of flanking,

1455
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,119
but one of the variables that we're

1456
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:32,240
looking at are how many people are

1457
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:35,119
currently in jail. Um and uh and an

1458
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,960
activator is basically what's the rule

1459
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,040
or what's the game dynamic that comes

1460
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,880
into play. So that's kind of interesting

1461
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,720
thing about the cops and robbers uh

1462
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,760
situation. I want to have more space to

1463
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,720
run when all my buddies are in jail, but

1464
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,960
there are a lot more cops going after me

1465
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,240
and that actually uh means that it's

1466
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,119
easier for them to flank me even though

1467
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,880
I have more space to run. So those are

1468
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,280
both a negative and a positive uh

1469
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,000
feedback system. more space to run is

1470
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,079
actually a negative feedback system. it

1471
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,160
uh and how you tell the difference is is

1472
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,720
it stabilizing to my state or is it

1473
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,960
cumulative to my state uh if if it's

1474
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,359
stabilizing which means you know I'm

1475
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,000
doing badly my team is doing badly but

1476
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:18,079
this is now giving me an edge uh or I'm

1477
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,079
doing really well and this is really

1478
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:24,480
crappy um Mario Kart has tons of these

1479
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,599
um those are negative feedback those

1480
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,280
those are things that basically reduce

1481
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,559
the the uh the gap between the best and

1482
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,480
and the people who were doing well,

1483
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,839
people doing well. Positive feedback is

1484
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,319
accumulated. They're doing well, they're

1485
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,480
going to do even better. So, the cops

1486
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,960
have got everybody but one and now it's

1487
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,720
five to one game. You know, the cops

1488
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,240
have a that that's a positive feedback

1489
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,839
system because now now they can do

1490
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,960
tactics as opposed to everyone going

1491
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:53,359
after someone. Um

1492
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,760
uh and and you have these two feedback

1493
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:58,240
loops kind of working together. There

1494
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,000
are tons of these in games. uh and games

1495
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,160
aren't really the kinds of closed

1496
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,599
systems that cybernet that cybernetics

1497
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,079
was actually originally designed to

1498
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,760
handle. Um in fact very few systems are

1499
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,319
actually closed systems in that way and

1500
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,480
games are actually better than most. Um

1501
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:15,040
but let's but let's talk about you know

1502
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,480
uh what's in all of the games we're

1503
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,599
talking about. What are some of some of

1504
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,680
the negative feedback loops? What are

1505
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,319
some of the positive feedback loops?

1506
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,319
Mario Kart team, you've got way too

1507
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,319
easy.

1508
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,359
>> Think of someone the game. you think of

1509
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,760
some of the games.

1510
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,640
>> Yeah, that's what I didn't know that the

1511
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,800
AI automatically go faster if there's a

1512
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,640
huge gap.

1513
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,319
>> That's more than just a Mario Kart

1514
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,839
actually. It does a lot of racing games.

1515
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,839
>> Also, when if you're playing like the

1516
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,359
Grand Prix, there's always three

1517
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,800
computers that are always better than

1518
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,800
everyone else and then all the rest of

1519
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,200
them. So, they will always be the ones

1520
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,720
that are in the top four like they're in

1521
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,640
the top always.

1522
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,119
>> But Mario Kart, think of different game,

1523
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,960
but let's take a look. Go through all

1524
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,720
the games. Uh

1525
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,920
>> uh sure. Think about chess. Actually,

1526
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,559
chess and white actually be an

1527
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,520
interesting one for

1528
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,240
>> No, but shot chess we take a shot after

1529
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,960
shot.

1530
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,319
>> Yes.

1531
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,119
>> That gets too easy.

1532
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,960
>> Well, it depends on Well, take it can be

1533
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,040
negative feedback, but there's also the

1534
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,240
method positive feedback. It depends on

1535
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,319
how you play.

1536
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,680
>> Yeah. Winner takes any drinking game

1537
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,480
pretty much.

1538
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,920
>> Yeah.

1539
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,000
>> It depends on what your goals are,

1540
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,599
right?

1541
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,280
Shot chest. Shot chest. You can have it

1542
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,640
that whenever you take a piece, you have

1543
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,400
to drink that piece. But then there's

1544
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,000
also whenever you take a piece, the

1545
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,280
opponent has to drink the piece.

1546
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,640
>> So that means so it can either be

1547
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,599
negative or positive feedback depending

1548
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,280
on how you play.

1549
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,520
>> Yeah. But but but let's pick a version

1550
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,520
of the game.

1551
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,440
>> Uh ideally pick the same game, but if

1552
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,760
it's too boring, pick something else.

1553
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,760
The same criteria.

1554
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:02,160
Okay. So, uh let's start

1555
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,920
from somewhere in the middle, which I

1556
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,599
think is this right here.

1557
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,839
>> So, we took a pretty easy one, but it's

1558
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,400
pretty like mathematical feedback. We we

1559
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,839
did war. Okay. Statistically, if you're

1560
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,559
winning, every time you win, you're

1561
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:16,000
lowering the value of your cards.

1562
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,799
>> You get the average value of your deck.

1563
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
>> Yeah. So, mathematically,

1564
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:23,280
positive feedback loop, right? Right.

1565
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,559
Right. Lowering the fact that you're

1566
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,000
getting more cards. Negative the fact

1567
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,799
that you're lowering the average value

1568
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,480
within your deck.

1569
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,280
>> So which which makes it harder for you

1570
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,839
to keep winning.

1571
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,880
>> Exactly.

1572
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,799
>> Okay.

1573
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,680
>> So that's just negative feedback. Any

1574
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,960
positive feedback loop?

1575
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,799
>> There's a small positive feedback loop

1576
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,359
in so far as you can't win unless you

1577
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,880
get all the cards. So thus winning hands

1578
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:43,880
gets you more cards gets you closer to

1579
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,880
winning.

1580
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,040
>> Yeah.

1581
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,640
>> Well, the more cards you have, the

1582
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,640
closer you're at winning. That's like

1583
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,240
saying any game with points, the more

1584
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,839
points you get, you're closer to winning

1585
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,000
their positive.

1586
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:58,160
>> Yeah,

1587
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,559
>> I guess those cards

1588
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,880
>> logically, but it's kind of

1589
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,240
>> Well, the only other one is if you if

1590
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,760
you have a war,

1591
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,880
>> then you win those three extra cards and

1592
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,119
depending on what they are could be

1593
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,839
positive, negative.

1594
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:15,200
>> Okay, great.

1595
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,920
>> Which way should we go? This this way.

1596
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,440
>> We switch to settlers. a bunch of

1597
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,240
feedback loops.

1598
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,359
>> Um, obviously like the more points you

1599
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,520
get, assuming those points are like

1600
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,880
cities and settlements and the more

1601
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,799
resources you're going to get in the

1602
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,720
future and those points you can build.

1603
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,559
So like eventually one player just has

1604
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,400
so much stuff can do whatever they want

1605
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,400
to positive, right?

1606
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:43,119
>> Yeah. Um, there's also negative feedback

1607
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,559
like the sensor is the relative prices

1608
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,359
of resources. the more one resource is

1609
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,119
worth in time in comparison to the other

1610
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,960
ones, the more people try to build on

1611
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,880
that resource brick

1612
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,960
>> and the less that resource would be

1613
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,559
worth in the future. So

1614
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,559
>> the long term they tend to balance out

1615
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,240
instead of having one go randomly out of

1616
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,280
control.

1617
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,680
>> Think about that one. That's

1618
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,520
interesting.

1619
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,319
>> Yeah.

1620
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,160
>> Also like the more

1621
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,240
this isn't exactly feedback, but like

1622
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,119
the more the better you're doing, the

1623
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,280
less likely people are going to try to

1624
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,400
Yeah, that's that's that's that that in

1625
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,720
my opinion is the biggest negative

1626
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,960
feedback loop in the entire game. If

1627
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,559
you're in the league, everyone hates

1628
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,680
you.

1629
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,960
>> You're not actually making any progress

1630
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,880
in the game.

1631
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,400
>> Okay. There's also um if if you have a

1632
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,839
bunch of resources like if you have a

1633
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,440
bunch of cities on like a resource and

1634
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,960
so like if someone draws a six and you

1635
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,599
end up getting like six resources from a

1636
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:43,760
tile then that's higher probability that

1637
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:47,920
if someone draws or rolls a seven the

1638
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,920
>> so I guess that's negative feedback too.

1639
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,839
the welling the servant and losing your

1640
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,319
cards mechanic is very much a negative

1641
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,480
feedback like I'm so rich now I'm not so

1642
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,319
rich you know and people who are kind of

1643
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,480
poor says I still got the same number

1644
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:04,079
same that's that that's negative

1645
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,200
feedback um a couple of things about

1646
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,119
negative feedback u uh to to keep in

1647
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,880
mind is that uh negative feedback does

1648
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,400
tend to make games last longer it it

1649
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,720
sort of staves out the ending of the

1650
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,000
game because obviously the difference

1651
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,160
between the people in the lead and

1652
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,680
people not in the lead are narrowed to

1653
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,760
the point that sometimes folks are back

1654
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,760
in contention again and uh positive

1655
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,799
feedback tends to make things end

1656
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:31,040
sooner. Um

1657
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:32,960
uh oh. Um

1658
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,599
okay. All right. I'll get

1659
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,680
>> um so in Scrabble, the main one that we

1660
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,280
came up with was that if you play a long

1661
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,720
word, you get a lot of points, but you

1662
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,400
and you also get a lot of tiles, which

1663
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,720
gives you opportunity to the next turn

1664
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,200
play more points or get like

1665
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,200
>> Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1666
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,200
>> There's also that the more tiles you

1667
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,559
play, the less tiles there are

1668
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,880
available. So that's kind of It's both

1669
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,359
positive and negative. That was

1670
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,640
>> immunity and yeah, it becomes kind of a

1671
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,359
negative feedback loop because you may

1672
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,160
just end up with fewer times.

1673
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,319
>> That's true.

1674
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,599
>> Any other negative?

1675
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:12,400
>> We try to make it into a show.

1676
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,880
>> Okay. That's that's let's that's put off

1677
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,240
that discussion.

1678
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,599
>> Yeah. Every time you play a bigger word,

1679
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,680
it's easier for someone else to play a

1680
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,240
word off of that.

1681
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,720
That's

1682
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,799
>> um that's an interesting thing because

1683
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,559
um that's actually a counter example to

1684
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:28,960
to to

1685
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:31,280
a point that was that was made by Eric

1686
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,119
Zimmerman because he argues that

1687
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,440
positive feedback actually magnifies

1688
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,200
early successes and negative feedback

1689
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,599
tends to magnify late ones just like in

1690
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,920
the Mario Kart example. It's great to be

1691
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,680
the second place, right? Because you

1692
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,040
know if you do a late a late game

1693
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,160
success that propels you in the first

1694
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,319
place just as the game ends. Uh whereas

1695
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,640
uh uh some of the examples that we've

1696
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:54,559
been hearing on public feedback, uh you

1697
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,440
know, if you manage to be the first one

1698
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,000
to build a city in settlers, you know,

1699
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,200
uh that tends to perpetuate your success

1700
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,680
for the rest of the game. Uh the game

1701
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,079
isn't quite as predictable as that, but

1702
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,280
you know, it's it's it's it's designed

1703
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,599
that way at least. Um but in but that's

1704
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,960
that's a very very good example of the

1705
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,079
you know you got this negative feedback

1706
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,799
loop near the end of the game where uh

1707
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:23,119
where you have a success by playing all

1708
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:27,359
of your tiles but the bag is almost

1709
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:29,440
empty. So now you are not getting not

1710
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:32,400
only are you not getting an advantage

1711
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,200
that early that late game success isn't

1712
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,520
translating into any kind of uh of of

1713
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,880
significant advantage later on. Still,

1714
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,720
you know, it's uh it's as a general

1715
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,839
rule, if you are dealing with a limited

1716
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:48,400
resource like tiles, uh then you know,

1717
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,920
you do have this situation where a

1718
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,079
positive feedback gain a positive

1719
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,640
feedback loop is kind of amplifying

1720
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,559
early successes

1721
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,799
and negative feedback loops make late

1722
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:02,000
successes more powerful.

1723
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:04,000
>> So, we're basically with a starcraft. I

1724
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,240
think with the starcraft

1725
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,799
the some of the This positive feedback

1726
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:16,160
is that the more worker you build and

1727
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:17,440
then the more you can get the mirror.

1728
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,640
>> The more workers you build, the more

1729
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,119
cash you get, the more cash you get, the

1730
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:24,319
more workers you can build.

1731
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:28,000
>> That's the another positive feedback

1732
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:30,559
loop is the the more that you destroy

1733
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,880
like you conquer your opponents, the

1734
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,119
harder it is for them to build up and

1735
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,839
defend against you. Well, it the easier

1736
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:41,599
it is for you to beat them. On the other

1737
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:43,920
hand, you want your feedback.

1738
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,920
>> Oh, then

1739
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:49,280
>> I think the positive feedback just like

1740
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,200
emphasize a lot of early game strategy.

1741
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,559
>> So, a negative feedback loop in

1742
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:57,119
Starcraft would be the faster you the

1743
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,960
more you expand your territories, the

1744
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,119
harder is for you to defend because

1745
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,640
you're spreading out your resources and

1746
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,280
the more friends you have. So the easier

1747
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,240
it is for your opponents to attack you.

1748
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,839
>> Yeah.

1749
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,599
>> Yeah. We were having that little

1750
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:11,520
discussion earlier and finding finding

1751
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,319
other negative people nukes was kind of

1752
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,720
tricky. Actually,

1753
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:19,359
>> another one that we I thought of was the

1754
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:21,440
the more the more uh research that you

1755
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:24,400
do, the less resources you have for

1756
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,200
building units or workers and such. And

1757
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,880
so you have to decide. I mean, you'll

1758
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,760
power up your units, but you may have

1759
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,079
less to actually build those units.

1760
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,520
But probably not really. It's that's a

1761
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,440
very small negative loop.

1762
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,160
>> I think another negative is like the

1763
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,079
more troops you have like the less like

1764
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,240
attention you can give to all each of

1765
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,599
them. So like hard

1766
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,559
>> less effectively.

1767
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:53,200
>> Yeah.

1768
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,559
>> Yeah. The more the more different

1769
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,680
screens you got to you got to keep your

1770
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,799
eye on basically.

1771
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,160
>> That's the thing that's the great thing

1772
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:01,520
about the the control one. So one go

1773
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,440
here two go here.

1774
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,960
So, one thing about team games though is

1775
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,599
there's a huge positive feedback if

1776
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,760
you're doing four or 3B 3D and you take

1777
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,039
out one of them and it's like so many so

1778
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,839
much easier.

1779
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,039
>> Yes.

1780
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:17,119
>> It's just harder than 3B2.

1781
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,359
>> Then you have a bunch of risk cuz what

1782
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,359
happens if you try taking out taking out

1783
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,200
one person, but then you fail and now

1784
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,920
you're weak, but then they have a lot

1785
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,640
more. There

1786
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,160
>> is risk.

1787
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,559
>> Yeah. So there's an interesting

1788
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,559
comparison with Warcraft 3 which did

1789
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:34,480
have negative feedback loop where if

1790
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:37,359
your army gets past a certain size then

1791
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,720
it costs more you kind of get taxed

1792
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,119
income.

1793
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,119
>> Um yeah I don't know if you guys know

1794
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,960
about this. Yeah. Basically think think

1795
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,640
like Starcraft but then you have a food

1796
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,720
count but once you get past a certain

1797
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,200
food count then each of your peons

1798
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,599
brings in less gold from the farm sorry

1799
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,599
from the gold mine. And it gets even

1800
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,640
worse the more troops you get. So you're

1801
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,240
kind of

1802
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,280
>> punished for being too far ahead.

1803
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,280
>> There's a very clear negative feedback.

1804
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,280
>> I This isn't a

1805
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,760
strict negative feedback loop, but it's

1806
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,880
interesting to look at uh the resource

1807
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,280
management. Um basically

1808
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,799
investing in

1809
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,240
units that bring in more resources or

1810
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,520
investing in other units that do

1811
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,680
fighting are all different positive

1812
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,559
feedback loops. And you can view not

1813
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:27,039
investing as negative feedback loops in

1814
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,760
those areas. Although that's really not

1815
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,520
completely true.

1816
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,480
>> Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if you're

1817
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,440
giving me trying to say that negative

1818
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,880
feedback, but you're right. They are

1819
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,720
different positive feedback loops. They

1820
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,559
work very differently. You know, winning

1821
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,680
a battle makes it easier for you to win

1822
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,839
later battles,

1823
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,359
>> but winning a uh but building more

1824
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:43,280
workers makes it easier for you to build

1825
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:46,319
more units. So

1826
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:50,640
>> uh kind of a not apparent uh positive

1827
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:53,920
feedback is the starcraft uh upgrading

1828
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:56,000
attack power by just once

1829
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,200
greatly increases its efficiency because

1830
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,160
now two attacks will take down four

1831
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,359
three attacks. I

1832
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,599
>> I don't want to get into that much

1833
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:05,440
detail.

1834
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,280
>> Very important. So I just went

1835
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,440
>> super key.

1836
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,200
>> I was I was going to say crunch you can

1837
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,319
have bigger workforce but every turn you

1838
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,960
have to pay for that. So you get more

1839
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,599
money if you work pay for that negative

1840
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,119
feedback.

1841
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,920
>> Yeah. That's that's that's that that's a

1842
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,319
key.

1843
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,280
>> Turns out in monopoly if you have a lot

1844
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:25,920
of money or stuff which people then land

1845
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,079
on which gives you more money.

1846
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,640
weird. That's that's

1847
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:33,039
>> top secret secret strategy winning

1848
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,640
Monopoly is to buy lots of stuff and

1849
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,920
then have people land on it so you can

1850
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:41,680
get more money. So actually but so this

1851
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:44,400
has just one little uh negative feedback

1852
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,039
into well actually two for uh

1853
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,880
>> income tax

1854
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,839
>> that's the income tax and like the

1855
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:54,079
>> and

1856
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:56,160
like several thousand hotels

1857
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,400
actual governments like that too right

1858
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,160
>> so so

1859
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,760
>> it's patent out of real life but then

1860
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,760
again so is the whole of Monopoly game

1861
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,599
the whole Monopoly game is about real

1862
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,240
life land ownership monopolies Atlantic

1863
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,200
City, I believe.

1864
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,480
>> Yeah.

1865
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,960
>> Atlantic City.

1866
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,280
>> So, yeah. Uh, and and that gives us a

1867
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,839
good segue into degenerate strategies.

1868
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,080
Yeah. Right.

1869
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:17,600
>> No.

1870
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,640
>> Sorry. Okay.

1871
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:23,759
>> All right. So, so I'll go into that a

1872
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,880
little bit, but uh maybe I'll get I'll

1873
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,159
get into that on Wednesday, but on

1874
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,440
Wednesday, we're going to focus that

1875
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,880
mostly on your uh on play testing the

1876
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,600
game. If we have no time for anything

1877
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,359
else, we are play testing your game. Uh,

1878
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,040
and so bringing the games, bringing your

1879
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,679
cards, make sure your cards are ready

1880
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,440
before class. Don't like frantically

1881
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:44,400
writing stuff. Uh, try not to be

1882
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:47,520
changing stuff right up to

1883
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:50,400
after class. Sometimes you might be feel

1884
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,159
pressured into that. Um, try to be ready

1885
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,000
before class starts. Uh, and try to show

1886
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:55,440
up at a right beginning of class because

1887
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,440
it will really really suck if you finish

1888
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,040
play testing. If you finish play testing

1889
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,560
someone else's game and that team

1890
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,600
doesn't have enough time to play test

1891
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,520
yours, okay? and it may happen and that

1892
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,120
will suck. So, let's try to start that

1893
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,600
uh right on time by this Wednesday.

1894
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,600
>> Thank you.
