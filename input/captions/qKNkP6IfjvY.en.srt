1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,480
Okay. So today we're doing linear

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:21,920
programming and we are um

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,720
yeah going to basically do a very I

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,279
think a four or five

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,000
lecture um

6
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,000
unit on linear programming and linear

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,920
programming is one of the big

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,600
I guess engines behind optimization

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,239
and to show how important it is um Well,

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,559
when I started working in

11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,800
1986,

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,440
there were a bunch of linear programming

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:57,280
um you know tools on the market and

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:02,559
Robert Bixby in 1987 founded a company

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:05,280
and wrote Clex which was the um by far

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,080
the best linear programming tool on the

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,119
market and he charged uh immense amount

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,159
for it and a lot of people bought it and

19
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,880
he retire and he sold his company 10

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,759
years later for I don't know4 or $50

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,000
million

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,799
and um you know and IBM recently bought

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,720
the company that he sold it to for $180

24
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,680
million so it's big business

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,000
and very important

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,439
okay

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,439
just yeah so what is linear programming

28
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,840
So I'm going to give two examples of

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,560
problems you might want to solve with

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,520
linear programming and

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,160
um

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,959
then we will continue with other things.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,360
So what is linear programming? It's

34
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,360
essentially

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,360
optimize

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,520
either minimize

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,520
or maximize

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,920
a linear function

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
subject to linear constraints.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,400
And we'll start with a diet model.

41
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,040
And um

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,959
so this is actually taken straight from

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,560
the lecture notes and I think

44
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,800
given the um

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,720
given the costs I think it only works if

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
you're feeding mice. So, let's say you

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,480
have some mice

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,599
um

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,599
and their nutritional requirements.

50
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,879
They need a certain amount of starch.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:45,239
Um and there are two grains you can give

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,239
them. Grain one and grain two. And

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,360
they need eight

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,319
units of starch,

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,319
15 units of protein, and seven units of

56
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,319
vitamins.

57
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:11,120
And grain one contains five,

58
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,519
four, and two, and costs um

59
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,519
60 cents.

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,600
And

61
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,960
grain two costs contains seven, two, and

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,600
one, and costs

63
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,440
35.

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,560
And the question is how cheaply can you

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,120
feed the mice and satisfy their

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,120
nutritional requirements.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,560
So what we do with linear programming is

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,520
we

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,320
need

70
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,320
to write down

71
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
a model.

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,680
And how do you write down a model? You

73
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,680
choose variables.

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,280
write

75
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,280
objective function and constraints

76
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,039
and then you feed your linear program to

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,199
a linear programming package and it will

78
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:29,960
give you the answer. So any suggestions

79
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,960
as to what the variables should be.

80
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,880
>> Yeah.

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
>> Yeah. How much of each grain? So let's

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,240
let x1

83
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,240
amount of grain one

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:55,520
and x2 be the amount of grain two.

85
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,759
And now we want to write down an

86
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,000
adjective function. So we either need to

87
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,720
minimize or maximize something. So what

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,720
do we want to minimize

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,520
the cost? So

90
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,520
let's write it down here. Minimize.

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:23,400
I guess it's

92
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,400
60 x1 + 35 x2.

93
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
And what are the constraints? Well, the

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
constraints are that they get enough

95
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,880
starch, get enough proteins, and get

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,880
enough vitamin. So that would be

97
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,600
And what we do when we write down linear

98
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,000
programs is we say subject

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,000
to

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
I believe we say subject two. Let's see

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
if

102
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,240
yeah subject to

103
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
before we write down all the

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,840
constraints.

105
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,520
So

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,520
subject two and now we need some things.

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,840
So we need

108
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,280
5 * the grain 1 + 7 * grain 2 has to be

109
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:16,319
at least 8.

110
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,000
So 5 x1 + 7 x2 is greater than or equal

111
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,960
to 8.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,199
And 4x1 + 2 x2 is greater than or equal

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,199
to 15.

114
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,360
And finally

115
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,360
2x1 + x2 is greater than equal to 7

116
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,360
and I'm not going to solve it in part

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,160
because it has an utterly trivial answer

118
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,680
and also

119
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,440
we're not going to actually tell you how

120
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
to solve linear programmings. in this

121
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,039
class.

122
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,000
Um there's something called the simplex

123
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,960
method and I will you know give you a

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,520
very rough overview of how the simplex

125
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,680
method works at some point. But actually

126
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,520
explaining exactly how the details work

127
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,879
is something first you'll probably never

128
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,440
need because there are tons of linear

129
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,199
programming packages and you can you

130
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,120
know just download one from the internet

131
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:30,479
and use that. And second,

132
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,000
it's, you know, it's explaining how it

133
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,000
works is somewhat interesting, but it's

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,440
also rather tedious and there are lots

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,120
of little um technicalities you have to

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,760
go through. So I don't really want to do

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,959
that.

138
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,240
So um

139
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,240
so that is linear program.

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,480
Oh wait,

141
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,959
I just realized there are two

142
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,040
constraints I did not write down. Does

143
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,040
anybody can anybody tell me what they

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,040
are?

145
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes.

146
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
>> Negative.

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,279
>> Non- negativity. Yeah. So, x1 greater

148
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,399
than or two x1 greater than or equal to

149
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,640
zero and x2 greater than equal to zero.

150
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,720
And these are non- negativity

151
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,240
constraints.

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,040
Non

153
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,040
negativity constraints.

154
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,519
And they're actually handled a little

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,720
bit differently than most constraints

156
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,240
in um

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,680
are often handled a little differently

158
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,360
from most constraints in linear

159
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,360
programming.

160
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Okay.

161
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,399
Okay. And now I'm going to come up with

162
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,040
a another example.

163
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,040
Okay. So, let's say you're having a bake

164
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,040
sale

165
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,720
and there are two things you know how to

166
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,720
bake. Let's say you know how to bake

167
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
cookies.

168
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,399
and we'll simplify the ingredient list.

169
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,880
Don't, you know, don't go home and use

170
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
this ingredient list for real cookies.

171
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,200
So,

172
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,200
um, eggs

173
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,720
we need one, sugar,

174
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:47,079
we need two cups, and flour,

175
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,079
we need one cup, no, one and 1/2 cups.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,600
And then you also know how to bake

177
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
meringues.

178
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,800
And for those you need three eggs,

179
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,279
you need one cup of sugar. And you don't

180
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,279
need any flour.

181
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,680
And you can sell

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,440
a batch of meringues

183
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,240
for $20.

184
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,640
And you can sell a batch of cookies

185
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,640
for $20.

186
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
So the first thing we need to do is

187
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,600
write down our variables. So what

188
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,600
variables would you use?

189
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Yeah.

190
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,480
>> No. Yes.

191
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
>> Like how many cookies and how many,

192
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,440
>> right? How many batches of cookies and

193
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:05,120
how many batches of meringue? So um

194
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,959
let's say x1

195
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:12,279
is the number of batches

196
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,279
of cookies

197
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:21,800
and x2 is a number of batches

198
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,800
of merangues.

199
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,920
And what do we have? Well,

200
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,120
you want to maximize the amount of

201
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,079
money. So, you want to maximize

202
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:44,959
um so our notes call the things you're

203
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:47,959
maximizing or minimizing Z. And

204
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,959
um

205
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,399
much of the time you don't actually need

206
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,399
to

207
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
not much of the time you don't actually

208
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,720
need to write down Z in your linear

209
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,839
program. But there are sometimes when

210
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,440
it's very useful to have a variable name

211
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,720
for the thing you're maximizing. So

212
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:15,440
we'll use it. Um, well, you don't want

213
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,279
to run out of eggs. So, that means that

214
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:24,760
the number of batches of cookies, x1

215
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,760
* 1 + 3 *

216
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,160
x2

217
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,959
had better be less than or equal to the

218
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,639
total number of eggs you have,

219
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,959
which I didn't tell you what how many

220
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,720
eggs you had.

221
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,399
Okay.

222
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,399
So, let's say we have nine eggs,

223
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,440
um,

224
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,440
eight cups of sugar,

225
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,839
and 15 cups

226
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,839
flour.

227
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,399
So, x1 + 3x2 is less than equal to 9.

228
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,560
And 2x1 + x2

229
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:22,519
is less than or equal to 8. And there's

230
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,519
another one. 1.5 * x3 x1

231
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,440
is less than or equal to 15.

232
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,680
And of course we have x1 greater than

233
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,680
equal to 0 and x2 greater than equal to

234
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,680
zero.

235
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,760
And one nice thing you can do with

236
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,160
linear programs if there's not very many

237
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,279
variables and not very many um

238
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,839
constraints is you can actually draw the

239
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,480
feasible region on the plane. So

240
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:05,040
I think I need to give you some notation

241
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,600
before I go ahead. Um

242
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,600
with drawing this

243
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,120
notation.

244
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,199
A feasible solution

245
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,440
is not necessarily optimal is a

246
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,079
is a point.

247
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,079
Let's say x1 through xn are our

248
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:59,079
variables or x1 x2

249
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,079
through

250
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
um

251
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm looking see if the notes

252
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,000
okay let's say x k

253
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,079
bit satis The size of the constraints.

254
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,186
[applause]

255
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,440
An optimal solution

256
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,360
is a feasible solution that optimizes

257
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,360
our objective function.

258
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,696
>> [groaning]

259
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,360
>> So,

260
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,360
okay.

261
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:40,400
So what does the feasible region look

262
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:44,799
like? Well, let's write it down. Let's

263
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:50,240
say this is x1 and this is x2

264
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:53,679
and we have x1 well we have 2 x1 + x2 is

265
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,440
less than equal to 8 which means we have

266
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:01,679
the point 8 up here and the point 4 down

267
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,559
here and we have the linear region

268
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,400
there.

269
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,080
So that's our first

270
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,960
constraint.

271
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,320
Second constraint is x1 + 3 x2 is less

272
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,080
than equal of 9. So now let's

273
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,679
put 9 here

274
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,280
three here. And our second constraint

275
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,280
will be everything under

276
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,280
this.

277
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,440
And the third constraint is 1.5x1 is

278
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,320
less than equal to 15 which means x1 is

279
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
less than or equal to 10 which means the

280
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,080
third constraint

281
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
is

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,200
everything to the left of this line.

283
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,120
So you can see that this third

284
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,480
constraint is completely

285
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,039
meaningless because anything that

286
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,400
satisfies the first two constraints must

287
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:09,520
satisfy the third one.

288
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,919
And the actual feasible reason is this

289
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,360
region

290
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,360
and the intersection of the first two

291
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,360
constraints.

292
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Okay.

293
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,720
I think before I need to say anything

294
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,679
more, I should say something about

295
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,360
the standard form and the canonical form

296
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
for linear programming programs.

297
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Because

298
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
so

299
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,160
the notes

300
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,840
form.

301
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,840
So maximum

302
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480
Z is equal to

303
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,120
cranspose.

304
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,960
These are our constraints. No, this is

305
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,360
our not constraints. This is our

306
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,520
objective function X.

307
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,440
So here

308
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,200
I guess

309
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,400
cranspose

310
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,400
is the vector 2020

311
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,440
um

312
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,919
ax

313
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,919
equals b

314
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,200
and x greater or equal to zero.

315
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,240
canonical form

316
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,080
maximum

317
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,480
and it's nearly the same cranspose

318
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,000
x

319
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,360
a sub x less than equal to b

320
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
x greater than or equal to zero

321
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,400
Thurm.

322
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:58,080
any

323
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:00,880
um linear program can be put

324
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,559
into

325
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,400
well either standard

326
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,400
or canonical

327
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
form.

328
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,960
So how do we do this?

329
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,080
Okay. So there are some easier one. So

330
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,760
suppose our objective function

331
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,080
suppose

332
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:39,039
objective function is minimize

333
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:43,240
3x + 5 3x1 + 5 x2. How would you turn

334
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,240
that into a maximization problem?

335
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
>> Yes. negative.

336
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:57,960
>> Yeah, exactly. Stick a negative on it.

337
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,960
Maximize - 3x1 - 5x2.

338
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,720
Okay.

339
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Um

340
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,039
suppose you

341
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,919
have

342
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,919
unconstrained variable

343
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,880
X subi

344
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,880
can be either positive or negative.

345
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,520
Maybe I should just tell you the answer

346
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
to this because it's not quite as

347
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,840
obvious as the last one.

348
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,200
Okay.

349
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,200
So replace

350
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,080
x i with

351
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:55,760
x sub i + - x sub i minus

352
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,000
x sub i + is greater than equal to zero.

353
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,720
x sub i minus is greater than equal to

354
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,520
zero.

355
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,760
So whenever you have

356
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,440
so I mean

357
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,679
doesn't matter whether x i is positive

358
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,440
or negative there's also ways some x i

359
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:17,480
plus and some x i minus which will give

360
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,480
you any value of x subi

361
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,559
and now these are non- negative

362
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,559
variables

363
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,559
Okay. So, there's two more cases I

364
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,080
should talk about. Um,

365
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,320
and they are a little bit more

366
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,320
complicated than this.

367
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Um

368
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,320
suppose

369
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,480
So let's look up here. So canonical form

370
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,640
all the constraints are inequalities.

371
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,039
Standard form all the constraints are

372
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,279
equalities. So to go back and forth

373
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,960
between canonical form or standard form

374
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,200
or just to put an arbitrary linear

375
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,440
program in canonical form we need to

376
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:39,080
turn inequalities into equalities and

377
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,080
vice versa. So suppose we have

378
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,520
have

379
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,960
um

380
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:52,960
x1 + 3 x2 less than equal to 9

381
00:25:48,960 --> 00:26:00,559
x1 x2 greater than equal to zero. How do

382
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:03,559
we make this in a How do we make this

383
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,559
inequality?

384
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,679
Any suggestions?

385
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
>> Yes,

386
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,720
>> you can add another variable. you add

387
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,480
another variable. Very good. What we add

388
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,039
do is we add something that's called a

389
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,039
slack variable

390
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:42,640
and we get x1 + 3 x2 + s

391
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,840
is equal to 9

392
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:53,600
with s greater than or equal to zero.

393
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:55,840
And if we have x1 + 3 x2

394
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,279
greater than equal to 9, we would add

395
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,279
something called a surplus variable.

396
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:13,559
x1 + 3x2

397
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,559
- x = 9 s greater than zero.

398
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:20,880
And the last thing is we do we need to

399
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:24,400
do is we need to say how to turn

400
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,120
any inequal equalities into

401
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:33,159
inequalities.

402
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,159
And that is actually again pretty easy.

403
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,399
So if we have x1

404
00:27:51,679 --> 00:28:01,520
+ 3 x2 = 9,

405
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:06,080
we can turn that into x1 + 3 x2

406
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:09,520
greater than or equal to 9 and x1 + 3 x2

407
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,360
less than or equal to 9.

408
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,720
So anything that satisfies this

409
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,559
satisfies that. And now if you don't

410
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,279
like if you want to put your thing in

411
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,159
canonical form, you need to get rid of

412
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,240
all the greater than equal to signs. But

413
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:33,720
that's easy. Then you just say - x1 -

414
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,720
3x2 is less than equal to - 9.

415
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,279
And this is canonical form.

416
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,679
So why do we need to worry about

417
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:54,679
canonical form and standard form?

418
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,679
Well,

419
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,559
standard form

420
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,600
use

421
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,600
in simplex method.

422
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,240
So the simplex method is one of the

423
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,559
standard ways of solving linear programs

424
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,279
and we're not going to go into it but as

425
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:30,399
I said I will sketch you the basic ideas

426
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:34,679
for it at some point and we use use this

427
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,679
in duality

428
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,760
and

429
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,320
duality is one of the most important

430
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,799
um

431
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,799
I guess aspects of linear program. Well,

432
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,240
another very important aspect of linear

433
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,760
program is that there's efficient method

434
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,360
of solving them. But as I said, we're

435
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,320
not going to um explain that very in

436
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,520
very much detail because,

437
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,520
you know, if you're, you know, a ma an

438
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,919
applied mathematician employed at some

439
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,200
company, you never actually solve linear

440
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,440
programming by hand. You

441
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,679
you use whatever tool you have

442
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,440
available, which is probably CLEX, if

443
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:25,039
it's a company that solves a ton of

444
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:27,200
different linear programs. And um

445
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,799
that's

446
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,600
you know you don't need to know what's

447
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:36,399
underneath the hood in CLEX but

448
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,080
if you are an applied mathematician you

449
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,000
really do need to know how to use

450
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,211
duality and I we will explain duality in

451
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,211
this course. [clears throat]

452
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,679
So,

453
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,039
um,

454
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,799
So let's write down a theorem.

455
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,279
Every

456
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,279
linear program

457
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,960
that has a solution

458
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,240
and optimal solution

459
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,960
has an optimal

460
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,880
optimal

461
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,440
basic

462
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,440
feasible solution.

463
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,799
Okay. So what is a basic feasible

464
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,919
solution? Well, the easiest way to

465
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,000
explain is

466
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,600
by looking at this diagram. Of course,

467
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,799
you know, real linear programs, this

468
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,519
diagram isn't planer. It's n-dimensional

469
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,039
and impossible to draw on a blackboard,

470
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,600
but

471
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:28,600
the basic idea is the same. So the basic

472
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
the

473
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,600
the basic feasible solutions

474
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,000
are basically the intersection

475
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:45,480
are the

476
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,480
extreme points of the feasible region.

477
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,880
So these are basic feasible

478
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
solutions

479
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,399
and the theorem is that one of these is

480
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,720
optimal.

481
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,720
So why are they called basic feasible

482
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,720
solutions?

483
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,120
Well, to explain that, I think I need to

484
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,159
go into

485
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,200
um standard form and put this linear

486
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,200
proto in standard form.

487
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,679
The above LP in standard form

488
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,120
is

489
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,120
um

490
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:42,159
maximize

491
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,919
Z = 20 X1 + 20 X2.

492
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,399
Um

493
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,399
subject two

494
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,760
um x1 + 3 x2 less than equal to 9

495
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,760
x2

496
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,840
or rather

497
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:10,639
plus s1. This is our slack variable. And

498
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:13,200
now we need 2 x1

499
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,800
plus x2.

500
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,440
And now we need a different slack

501
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,440
variable for the second equation. You

502
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,440
need a slack variable for each equation.

503
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,919
When you're doing this and finally

504
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,800
15x1.5x1

505
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,800
is less than equal to 15.

506
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,839
So that would be plus S3

507
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,839
equals 50.

508
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,040
So a basis Here

509
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:41,000
basis is a linearly independent

510
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,000
set of columns.

511
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,680
So

512
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,680
let's just take

513
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,680
um

514
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,720
this one.

515
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,119
Okay. So that is x1

516
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,440
plus s1

517
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,280
= 9.

518
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,280
2x1 + s2

519
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,480
s2 =

520
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,480
8

521
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,800
and 1.5 x1 + x3.

522
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,480
Actually,

523
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,119
we're just picking these three columns.

524
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,880
So, we leave this one. So, that is equal

525
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,880
to

526
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,880
15.

527
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,839
And for every basis there's a solution

528
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:05,200
because this is just uh

529
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:10,119
you know an a a matrix times a vector

530
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,119
equals a vector.

531
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:18,240
I mean it's just uh

532
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:21,920
set of linear equations with k

533
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,000
equations and k variables. So it has a

534
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,000
solution.

535
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Um,

536
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:38,480
and I guess this solution would be x1 =

537
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:41,480
10. And now you could use this to get S2

538
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,480
equals

539
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:53,400
that's 20 + S2 = 8 - 12 and

540
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,400
S1 = -1.

541
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,880
So you can see that this

542
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,280
basis

543
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,800
is not

544
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,800
feasible solution.

545
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:15,240
because it violates the

546
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,240
um non- negativity constraints.

547
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,880
But

548
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,640
every linear program has a feasible

549
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:29,119
solution which the feasible points here

550
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,520
correspond

551
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,640
to the

552
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:41,200
extreme points of the feasible region.

553
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:43,520
And the optimal one is the one 20 x1 +

554
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,359
20 x2

555
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:52,440
that is furthest in the direction of the

556
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,440
vector which is the objective function.

557
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,119
And what does the linear programming

558
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,760
what does the simplex algorithm do?

559
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,320
Well, what the simplex algorithm does is

560
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,880
it starts at

561
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:11,920
one basic feasible solution, which in

562
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,400
this case you would use 0 0 and it walks

563
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,079
along the edges

564
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,720
until

565
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,839
and it chooses an edge which improves

566
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,440
the objective function every time. And

567
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,119
there's always an edge that improves the

568
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,760
objective function unless you're

569
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,520
actually at the optimum. So that just

570
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,079
walks along the edges until it reaches

571
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,200
the optimum.

572
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,720
So is this an efficient algorithm?

573
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,480
Well,

574
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,119
this is a little bit of um

575
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,920
you know, history which

576
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,200
we're not going to um

577
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,720
you know, we're not going to test you

578
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:56,480
on, but you know, this was Donsig's

579
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:59,440
simplex algorithm just to walk along the

580
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,960
edges and he proposed it. It worked

581
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,040
really well in practice, but pretty much

582
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,280
for any

583
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,200
I mean, you need some way of choosing

584
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,920
which edge you're going to walk along.

585
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,960
And pretty much for any way of choosing

586
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,720
which edge you want to walk along,

587
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,680
people could come up with a counter

588
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,160
example which it took exponentially many

589
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,079
steps along the edges.

590
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,599
So

591
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,920
it works really well in practice. In the

592
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,480
worst case,

593
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,480
nobody could,

594
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,040
you know, nobody could prove that it

595
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,640
worked really well.

596
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,359
And

597
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,200
this lasted until

598
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:49,920
Dan Spielman and um Tang, Dan Spielman

599
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,240
was a professor at MIT at the time,

600
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,520
invented a new technique called smooth

601
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:59,200
analysis that says that it works really

602
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,200
well almost all the time.

603
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
So

604
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:08,920
that is probably all we're going to say

605
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,920
on the simplex algorithm.

606
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,240
Okay.

607
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,240
So now I want to talk about duality

608
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,760
and we're going to use this

609
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,760
linear program as a

610
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:45,359
you know as an example. And actually

611
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,599
as you can see from that diagram we

612
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,760
could just get rid of this constraint.

613
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,960
it doesn't make any difference and just

614
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,960
look at these first two constraints.

615
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,680
So what we're going to do is we're going

616
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,560
to ask how can we find a lower bound on

617
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,640
the optimum and how can we find an upper

618
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,079
bound on the optimum

619
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,040
and then we will show that

620
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,760
these two bounds actually will end up

621
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,560
being equal

622
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:26,680
under some conditions. So lower bound

623
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,680
any feasible solution

624
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,800
solution

625
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,800
gives a lower bound.

626
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:46,079
So let's take a feasible solution for

627
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:48,640
that one. Um how about x1 = x2 = 2. That

628
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:54,119
satisfies all the constraints.

629
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,119
X1 = X2 = 2

630
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:06,079
and um

631
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:10,040
does that 2 + 6 is 8 and 4 + 2 is 6 and

632
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,040
those are satisfied

633
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:24,920
and the objective function

634
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:24,920
is 20 * 2 + 20 * 2 is equal to 80.

635
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,240
So that is one way you could do this.

636
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,800
And I should say that for this linear

637
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,520
program, even though I've called them

638
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,040
batches, you have to assume that you can

639
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,800
use fractional numbers for x1 and x2.

640
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,040
Otherwise, you get an integer program

641
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,440
and not a linear program. And those are

642
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,400
much more complicated.

643
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:55,880
Okay, so any feasible solution gives you

644
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,880
a lower bound. How about an upper bound?

645
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,319
So

646
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,760
let's I'm going to write down something.

647
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:12,720
20 x1 + x2,

648
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:19,760
okay,

649
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:22,480
is certainly less than 20 x1 + 3 x2,

650
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,920
right? Because we have

651
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,359
well because x2 is positive. And now we

652
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,640
have x1 + 3x2 is less than equal to 9.

653
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,920
So this is less than or equal to 20 * 9

654
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,599
= 180.

655
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,200
And we can do the same thing for the

656
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:47,599
second um constraint.

657
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:49,280
20 x1 + x2 is less than equal to 20

658
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,760
*

659
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:58,359
2x1

660
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,359
+ x2 is less than or equal to 160.

661
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:06,000
So these are both good upper bounds and

662
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,240
this is a good lower bound. Can we do

663
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,040
better?

664
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,040
Okay, let's do better.

665
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,880
Let's add this and this.

666
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,040
We have

667
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:44,280
two. Let's see. We have 3x1

668
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,280
+ 4x2.

669
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:49,776
[applause]

670
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:59,000
So we're adding these two constraints.

671
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,000
It's less than or equal to 17

672
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,079
and you know we have 203.

673
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,400
Oh,

674
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,319
20

675
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:28,640
x1 + x2 is

676
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:31,680
less than or equal to 20/3 * 3x1 + 4 x2

677
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:36,880
is less than or equal to 20/3

678
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,599
* 17 which is equal to um 113 and the

679
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,200
third.

680
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,920
Okay,

681
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,160
so we got a much better upper bound by

682
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:52,480
adding these two constraints.

683
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,560
So what happens if we find the best sum

684
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,119
of these constraints?

685
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,119
How does it look?

686
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:13,920
Okay. So I want to go about this more

687
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:16,640
systematically so we can find the dual

688
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:21,040
linear program. Every linear program has

689
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:25,240
a dual linear program and we want to do

690
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,240
this. So we have

691
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and

692
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,160
you know the way we

693
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,480
the way we will do this is we will

694
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,240
assume that the linear program is

695
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,200
canonical

696
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,040
in canonical form for the time being and

697
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,560
luckily this linear program just happens

698
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:55,119
to be in canonical form.

699
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,720
So how do we do this? Well,

700
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:01,079
what we want to do is we want a

701
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,079
combination of

702
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,680
a combination

703
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,520
of these

704
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,000
constraints

705
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,880
which will let us give a best upper

706
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:22,000
bound possible. So let's say we have y1

707
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:25,480
* our first constraint x1 + 3x2 is less

708
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,480
than equal to 9

709
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:38,319
and y 2 * our second constraint

710
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,480
um that's 2x1 + x2 is less than or equal

711
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,480
to

712
00:48:40,678 --> 00:48:42,698
>> [applause]

713
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,920
>> And now

714
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,839
we want

715
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,559
this combination

716
00:48:53,839 --> 00:49:00,280
to be less than

717
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,280
or equal to.

718
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,079
All right.

719
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,920
We want 20 x1 + x2 to be bigger than to

720
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,000
be less than or equal to our

721
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,200
combination. So we want the combination

722
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,200
to be bigger than or equal to

723
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:30,760
20 x1 + 20 x2. So that tells us that y1

724
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,760
* 1 + y 2 * 2

725
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,119
had better be bigger than 20.

726
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,720
And 3 y1 + y 2

727
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,079
is also bigger than or equal to 20.

728
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:02,119
So suppose we found y's like this. What

729
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,119
would we have?

730
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,760
We would have

731
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,200
y1

732
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,200
x1.

733
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:27,520
Okay, I want it. Y1 + 2 Y 2

734
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:33,359
X1 +

735
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:36,359
3 Y1 + Y 3 Y1 + Y2

736
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,359
X2

737
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:46,280
is greater than or equal to 20 x1 + 20

738
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,280
x2.

739
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,880
So this

740
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:58,240
would be our things and this is in turn

741
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:03,720
less than or equal to

742
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,720
I want to say 9 y1 + 8 y 2

743
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,160
y 2

744
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:27,920
So to get the best bound on 20 x1 + 20

745
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:30,559
x2, we need to minimize 9 y1 + 8 y2. So

746
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:37,119
we want to minimize

747
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:38,720
9 y1 + 8 y 2 subject to

748
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:43,425
um

749
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:45,280
y1 + 2 y2 greater than equal to 20.

750
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:49,920
>> [applause]

751
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:54,400
>> and 3 y1 + y2

752
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:59,200
+ y2 greater than equal to 20

753
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:03,839
and y1 y2 greater than equal to zero. So

754
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:07,599
why y1 y2 greater than equal to 0? Well,

755
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:11,280
I mean, if y 2 was less than zero, then

756
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,839
when we add these equalities up, we

757
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,079
have,

758
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,079
you know,

759
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,680
the less than or equal to if y2 was less

760
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,200
than or equal to zero, the less than

761
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,040
equal to sign would turn into a greater

762
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,800
than equal to sign and adding these

763
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,200
inequalities up would not make any

764
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,319
sense. So, we need the yi is greater

765
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:37,160
than equal to zero.

766
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:37,160
So what did we what did we get here?

767
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,400
What is this thing?

768
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,880
It's another linear program. So this is

769
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,000
the dual

770
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,000
linear program.

771
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,960
And now I want to write down

772
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:09,599
I want to write down the dual linear

773
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:12,640
program for an arbitrary program in

774
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:16,599
um canonical form

775
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,599
and then we will

776
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,319
show the theorem of weak duality.

777
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,240
But maybe I want to um

778
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,240
maybe I want to solve these linear

779
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,240
problems first.

780
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,720
So

781
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,839
x1

782
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,480
Okay=

783
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:20,119
3 x2 = 2.

784
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,119
This is a feasible point.

785
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:34,400
X1 = 3. X 2 = 2. That's 3 + 2 * 3 is

786
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,160
less than equal to 9. And 6 + 2 is less

787
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:43,839
than equal to 8. So this is a feasible

788
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:47,319
point. And objective function is 20 * 5

789
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,319
= 100.

790
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,520
Now let's solve this one.

791
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:04,160
Okay, I did not write down the solution

792
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,920
here. But there is a solution to this

793
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,720
linear program. So the objective

794
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,359
function is also 100.

795
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,240
And um

796
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:16,800
you know the dual program gave you an

797
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,160
upper bound and the feasible point in

798
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,160
the dual program gives you an upper

799
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,720
bound. A feasible point in the primal

800
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,920
program gives you a lower bound. So

801
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,559
because this 100 is equal to that 100

802
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:34,599
then

803
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,599
we are we know that the answer is 100.

804
00:55:46,880 --> 00:56:00,400
So let's try y1 = 4, y 2 = 8.

805
00:55:52,640 --> 00:56:07,599
4 + 16 is 20. 12 + 8 is 20. and

806
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:10,559
9 * 4 + 8 * 8 is equal to 100.

807
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:13,119
So here is a feasible point for the dual

808
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,680
program which also gives the optimum

809
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,680
objective value.

810
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,280
Okay.

811
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,280
So,

812
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,200
canonical

813
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,520
form

814
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:05,799
duel.

815
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,799
Okay. Well, the primal

816
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,480
was maximize

817
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:19,119
z= c transpose x

818
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,920
sub subject to a x

819
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:24,684
less than equal to b and x greater than

820
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,400
zero.

821
00:57:24,684 --> 00:57:28,880
>> [clears throat]

822
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,760
>> Well, the duel

823
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,760
turns out to be minimize

824
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:41,200
y I'm sorry w equals

825
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,960
b transpose y

826
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:48,720
subject to a transpose

827
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,720
y is greater than equal to c y greater

828
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,119
than equal to zero.

829
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:56,125
And you can see why this is maybe by

830
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,145
looking at this example. Um

831
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,145
[clears throat]

832
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,720
when we did this example, we had you

833
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:09,920
know the original linear program

834
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:14,079
had the matrix A 1 3 2 1.

835
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:20,839
This now has the matrix A equals 1 2 3

836
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:20,839
1. And this two came from the

837
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:32,520
A I J A12

838
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,520
thing a um a 21

839
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:41,680
um entry of A and now it's the A12 entry

840
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:43,599
of the new A. So this is just this

841
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,280
matrix is just the transpose of the

842
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,640
original.

843
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:53,920
The right hand sides are just the

844
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:58,079
original um objective function and the

845
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:03,440
new objective function is just the right

846
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:06,265
hand sides of these inequalities.

847
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,265
So [clears throat]

848
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,359
um we have

849
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:20,240
a transpose

850
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,400
instead of a the objective function gets

851
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,400
turned into the right hand side of the

852
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,559
constraints and the right hand side of

853
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,960
the constraints gets turned into the new

854
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,960
objective function.

855
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,720
Okay.

856
00:59:53,200 --> 01:00:00,520
Okay. So now I will prove something

857
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,520
called weak duality.

858
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,799
Durham

859
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:15,799
weak

860
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,799
duality.

861
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:28,280
If x is a feasible solution of the

862
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,280
primal

863
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,640
with objective

864
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
function

865
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,119
um

866
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:50,119
z= cranspose

867
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,119
x

868
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:58,520
And y is a feasible solution

869
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,920
of dual

870
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,880
objective function

871
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,119
w equals

872
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,817
b transpose

873
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,817
Y [sighs]

874
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,880
and then

875
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,400
Z is less than group W.

876
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:44,559
So any feasible solution of the primal

877
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,720
is less than any feasible solution of

878
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,720
the duel.

879
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,520
Okay. There's also something called

880
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,000
strong duality

881
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,079
which we're not going to have a chance

882
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,559
to prove today. We will do that next

883
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:07,599
time. But I'm going to tell you what it

884
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,559
is and then we'll get the proof of weak

885
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:13,920
duality.

886
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,720
So strong duality is really

887
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:20,839
I want to say this is

888
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,839
one of the great um

889
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,559
one of the most important you know

890
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,960
theorems in cominatorial optimization

891
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,960
strong duality

892
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,799
the

893
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:51,960
If the optimum

894
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,960
Z star is finite

895
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:06,480
so is W star

896
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:08,720
and Z star is equal to W star.

897
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,359
So weak duality says that for any

898
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,960
feasible solution

899
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,680
the

900
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,680
value for the

901
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:22,559
primal is lesser through the value for

902
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:27,599
the dual. Strong duality says that

903
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:32,920
if the you know if the optimal values

904
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,920
are finite then they are equal.

905
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,880
Okay. So how do we prove weak duality?

906
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:01,039
So we have Z equals

907
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,640
proof

908
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,559
of

909
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,559
weak

910
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,559
duality.

911
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,559
We have Z

912
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,440
equals

913
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,440
cranspose X.

914
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,240
Recall

915
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:32,599
a transpose y was greater than equal to

916
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,599
c. So that's one of our

917
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,319
constra that's our constraints of the

918
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:45,680
duel. So what we're going to do is we're

919
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:47,440
going to plug this into here and we get

920
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:53,280
um

921
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:55,920
cranspose X is less than or equal to

922
01:04:53,280 --> 01:05:00,240
A transpose Y

923
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:04,079
transpose X which is equal to Y

924
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,079
transpose A

925
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,799
And now

926
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,680
well

927
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:18,400
do we have something about

928
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,400
ax there? Up there we have ax less or

929
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,640
equal to b. So let's plug that into

930
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:29,799
here. And that's less than equal to

931
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:29,799
yrpose b. And what was yrpose b?

932
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,200
um y transpose b.

933
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:41,039
Well,

934
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:43,920
that's just actually the transpose of b

935
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:48,480
transpose y transpose

936
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,480
and branspose y

937
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,119
was w.

938
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,799
So this

939
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,839
uh

940
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:59,280
this is w because w is a scalar. So

941
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:04,240
transposing it doesn't make any

942
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:06,000
difference. So that says that Z

943
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,920
is less than equal to this thing which

944
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,240
is less included this thing which is

945
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,240
equal to W. So Z is less than W.

946
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:31,280
Okay, there's two more things I want to

947
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,359
do today.

948
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:37,119
Although [clears throat]

949
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:40,599
I'm not entirely sure we'll get by more

950
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,599
than one of them.

951
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:57,160
The duel

952
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,160
of the duel is the primal

953
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,720
and really I think probably all of you

954
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:13,520
were expecting this to be true.

955
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,039
So [clears throat]

956
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,280
um

957
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,760
the primal

958
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,760
is the maximum

959
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:30,799
Z= Crpose X

960
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:33,200
such that or subject to sorry A X is

961
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:35,440
less than or equal to B and X greater

962
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,839
than equal to zero.

963
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,720
Now the dual

964
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:44,799
is minimum

965
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:48,280
of W = B transpose Y

966
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:48,280
subject to

967
01:07:52,160 --> 01:08:00,039
A transpose Y greater than equal to C Y

968
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,039
greater than equal to zero.

969
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:20,560
So before we can go on, we want to put

970
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,080
the duel in the canonical form because I

971
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,600
haven't told you how to take dus of

972
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,279
anything that's not in the canonical

973
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,520
form. So one way you can take duels of

974
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,279
an arbitrary pro linear program is first

975
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,440
put into canonical form and then take

976
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:37,359
the duel. Another way is to

977
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,199
go back and look at the proof and figure

978
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,679
out the formula for taking the duel of

979
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,239
an arbitrary linear program. And we'll

980
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:48,799
do that next time.

981
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:55,400
So, but let's put this in

982
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:55,400
canonical form. So, how do we turn a

983
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:02,799
uh minimization into a maximization? We

984
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:06,920
saw this already. We just take the

985
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,920
negative. So, we need to

986
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,600
So, what we need to do is we need to

987
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:18,040
maximize

988
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,040
minus brpose y

989
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:23,759
subject to

990
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,279
yeah

991
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,679
well

992
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:30,960
this inequality is the wrong way around

993
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:34,319
for um

994
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,159
a canonical form. So let's

995
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,960
take the negative of it. Subject to

996
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:43,679
minus a transpose

997
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:47,960
y is less than equal to minus c

998
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,960
and y greater than or equal to zero.

999
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:57,080
So this is the canonical form. So all we

1000
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,080
do is we um

1001
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:06,080
we want to take the transpose of a

1002
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:12,199
and

1003
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:12,199
put this up here. So

1004
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,400
the duel is

1005
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,920
minus

1006
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:26,840
crpose

1007
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,840
x

1008
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,080
um

1009
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,320
subject

1010
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,080
to

1011
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:41,560
okay we need to take the transpose of

1012
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,560
this that gives us a minus a

1013
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:51,719
x is greater than or equal to

1014
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,719
um minus b.

1015
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,239
But now if we just take the negative of

1016
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,679
this and the negative of this we get

1017
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:04,239
back to the original thing maximize z=

1018
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,800
cranspose x such that ax is less than

1019
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:09,199
equal to b rather than minus ax is

1020
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,520
greater than minus b and x greater than

1021
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,520
equal to zero.

1022
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:21,080
So the transpose of the transpose is the

1023
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:21,080
dual which

1024
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,560
no makes

1025
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,760
which justifies the name or the sorry

1026
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:37,800
the duel of the duel is the primal which

1027
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,800
justifies the name duel.

1028
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,760
Okay,

1029
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,760
I have four minutes left and I don't

1030
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,040
know if I can say anything reasonable in

1031
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,360
four minutes. Are there any questions

1032
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,360
about this?

1033
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:58,880
Okay. So, one thing

1034
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:02,239
you do when you're first see a linear

1035
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:05,760
program, if you're doing research, is

1036
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:08,320
take the duel and stare at it and see if

1037
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,080
it makes any sense intuitively. There

1038
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,199
are lots of linear programs where if you

1039
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,880
take the duel and you stare at it, it

1040
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:18,400
makes sense intuitively and you

1041
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:20,880
understand why the duel is an upper

1042
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,400
bound on the optimum of the primal.

1043
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,040
There are also lots of other linear

1044
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:27,600
programs when you get it, you take the

1045
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:30,480
duel, you stare at it, and you scratch

1046
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:33,440
your head and you say, why is this a

1047
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,920
bound on the primal? And I mean, you

1048
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,880
know it is because it's the duel, but

1049
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:42,520
it's not intuitively obvious.

1050
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,520
So, um,

1051
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,520
and you know, some of those if you stare

1052
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:49,520
at it for longer, you understand what's

1053
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,440
going on. And some of them you can stare

1054
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:57,400
at it for as long as you want and you

1055
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:57,400
probably still won't understand. So, um,

1056
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:04,159
we're going to see illustrations of I

1057
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,560
think after the

1058
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:09,600
after the quiz

1059
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:13,360
or maybe before the quiz.

1060
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,760
Yeah, we will see illustrations of

1061
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,040
this kind

1062
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,040
no of

1063
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:23,360
primal program making intuitive sense

1064
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:27,360
and then the dual

1065
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:30,400
makes also intuitively sense and

1066
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:33,679
is clearly an upper bound on the primal.

1067
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:38,400
So you're going to see that in um I

1068
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:40,719
guess zero sum games and in um probably

1069
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:44,080
max flow.

1070
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:46,640
Okay. So I will see everybody on

1071
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:50,400
Thursday and we will talk more about

1072
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:53,440
linear programs and duels

1073
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:58,120
and I will put out a homework tonight

1074
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,120
which I think will be due next Tuesday.
