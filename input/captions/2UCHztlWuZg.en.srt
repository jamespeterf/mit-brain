1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,880
So uh the uh what I I'll talk mostly

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,320
about u riskneutral pricing and uh black

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,000
shows will be more of uh uh of an

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,399
illustration to to to the method to more

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,559
general method which I think is very

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,360
important and very important for pricing

7
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:45,360
derivatives. uh and many many a few of

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,719
you uh did uh look into black shells. Uh

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,559
so my hope is to to give some a little

10
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,559
bit more depth and a little bit more

11
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,280
perspective on uh how what is the bigger

12
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,239
picture of derivative pricing uh through

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:06,479
through risk neutral valuation. But as

14
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:08,479
promised uh before let's start from uh

15
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,520
from the interest rates from from the

16
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,920
slide which similar slide which I showed

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,479
you on the first class and Andrew

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,159
Gensson already talked about yield curve

19
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,200
construction and everything but yeah so

20
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,159
that's how what happened since since we

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,920
started uh that's the yield curve

22
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,000
or it's just as planning as it was in in

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,159
September just before beginning of the

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,880
class and that's where we are now. So uh

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,520
quite predictable in a sense because fed

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:50,079
moved the the rates for by 75 basis

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:55,280
points and that's uh that's exactly uh

28
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:59,759
what what uh what happened uh here uh uh

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:05,280
the uh uh

30
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:10,319
the uh the the parallel shift is only uh

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,400
at 70 base points. here but more of a

32
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,920
50 here.

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,520
Uh what uh now a little bit of

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,520
huristics. How does it look like? Well,

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:27,120
right now it looks like we are very

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
similar to to this shape, right?

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,000
Which was

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,879
uh 19,

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,480
right? On the other hand, this shape

40
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,120
is is almost exactly the same, right?

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,599
Which was in fact just before the

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,760
crisis. So, uh in both cases a recession

43
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,760
fall I mean in both in both cases there

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,560
the curves are inverted and in both

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,160
cases the recession followed shortly

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,959
after. I certainly think hope that it is

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,800
closer to this because just this is

48
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,519
basically the next snapshot in uh in 21

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,360
and the curve is completely normal shape

50
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,000
and and the economy was uh the recession

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,200
was very very short and the economy was

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,879
on a very solid track by then but and

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,440
hopefully we are not in this situation

54
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,879
because this is just before the crisis.

55
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,840
It's before before bare turns collapse

56
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,799
before lemon collapse. So a lot of bad

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,680
things happened after that. uh uh in any

58
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:38,959
case uh this is all non non-scientific

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,640
prediction and the the real question

60
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,200
here would be to to to do some soral

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,000
data analysis something like Stefan

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,640
Stefan Andre talked about about

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,440
analyzing the shape of the curves and

64
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:59,040
bond markets using uh

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,040
uh PCA principal component analysis but

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,799
always fascinating to look at the data

67
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,360
and always fascinating to look at the

68
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:11,360
curves which in my opinion are in the

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,840
middle in the center of finance.

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, let's move on to uh

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,639
to the

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,880
uh topic of our class. And the idea is

73
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,800
to to see

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,320
uh how replicating the payoff can help

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:38,160
us to price derivatives.

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:41,680
uh and how to learn that actually if we

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,280
can follow market market dynamics

78
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,320
uh that how it can help us to price

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,639
derivatives and actually that the real

80
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,560
world dynamics is not that important

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,120
it's it's what market implies uh that's

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,800
what important and how it is connected

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,520
to morting gales and to mathematical

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,680
apparatus to to stocastic calculus

85
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,800
connecting that. So, but yeah, here is a

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:13,919
simple example uh horse betting, right?

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
So, uh let's

88
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,479
assume

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,120
clear that we have two horses, horse one

90
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,120
and horse two.

91
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,320
And we I mean you're a bookie and you

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,240
know the horses well. you know that this

93
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:38,080
horse has 20% to uh chance to win and

94
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,440
this horse has 80% chance to win,

95
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:47,919
right? But people bet uh bet on the

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:50,800
market and uh uh 10,000

97
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,880
is bad on this horse. People don't know

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
exactly these probabilities. They know

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,199
that this this horse is better than

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,000
this. So they they bet rather

101
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,280
the public bets

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,199
50,000 on this and 10,000 on on this,

103
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,759
right?

104
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,160
Um and then what you do, you just take a

105
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,120
commission, right?

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,319
Uh say 1%

107
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,479
and you you have

108
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,039
6,000 in your uh uh 600 in your pocket

109
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,520
of the commission. So now the question

110
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:32,000
is you need to set the odds for for this

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,520
race right. So well one way to set the

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,160
odds is knowing the real exact

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:43,000
probabilities. One it's reasonable to

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,000
say let's make it four to one.

115
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,560
So what what outcomes are possible

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,880
right? Then horse starts horses race.

117
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,800
So

118
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,800
H1 wins H2 wins.

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,919
So if a uh horse uh the first horse

120
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,919
wins, you will get

121
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,919
50,000,

122
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,360
right? This this amount and you will pay

123
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:25,160
out four times this amount because you

124
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,160
set uh you set the odds four to one.

125
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,800
So

126
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,400
this will mean that you will be left

127
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,880
with 10,000 profit.

128
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,120
This is low probability outcome. You

129
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,039
know that second horse is better. So

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,400
what happens is second horse win uh

131
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,919
second horse wins. Well, you will keep

132
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,800
this money. So it will be

133
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,120
10,000

134
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,120
and you will pay a quarter of this,

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
right?

136
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,919
And this will be

137
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,919
on my books minus

138
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,919
2,500

139
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,479
at the end, right? So you you will lose,

140
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,639
you will have to pay, right? Of course,

141
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,520
if you compute expected value, if horses

142
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:30,479
run along many many times, it will be

143
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:36,479
zero, right? Uh 10 *

144
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:39,839
2 plus minus 2 2 and a half time.8

145
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:44,800
is zero, right? But for this on average

146
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:48,240
it the horses have to run a lot. Right?

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,200
Now let's consider a different way of

148
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,160
setting uh setting odds.

149
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,680
You forget about the these numbers. You

150
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:03,800
just look at at at what was bad, right?

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,800
And you rather set the odds five to one.

152
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay, let's see what happens.

153
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:17,080
Well, if the first horse wins, you will

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,080
get 500

155
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,800
50,000

156
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,800
and you'll pay 50,000, right?

157
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Well, if second horse uh wins, you'll

158
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:39,120
get uh you'll get 10,000

159
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,120
and 1/5 of this. So you'll pay out

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,120
10,000.

161
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:50,560
So no matter which horse wins wins, you

162
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,360
are you break even for sure in in this

163
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,279
particular outcome, right? So and if you

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,360
were collecting some fee, you just keep

165
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,880
the feed. You'll do it next time.

166
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,880
So

167
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:09,600
basically what you did by setting the uh

168
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,120
the uh the odds according to the market

169
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,200
you hedged yourself. You you eliminated

170
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,079
every uncertainty

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,600
which is probably

172
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,720
the the outcome which you want.

173
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,519
All right. So this is all about betting

174
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,680
and we are not betting people.

175
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,600
In fact, we are scientists.

176
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,000
So, and

177
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,600
we'll uh we'll be talking today about

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,440
pricing derivatives. Uh again, some

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,640
simple examples and derivatives which

180
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,800
we'll be looking at uh will be uh call

181
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,040
put options and and forward contracts

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,880
just to refresh. So, what are those? So

183
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,720
the the simplest possible

184
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
derivative is a forward contract which

185
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,760
is an agreement

186
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,399
to buy a security in our case a stock in

187
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,720
the future for for a price which is set

188
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,920
today.

189
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:16,880
Uh generally speaking uh so uh the the

190
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,760
payout of of a forward is just the

191
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,760
difference

192
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,760
of

193
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:31,680
uh of the strike and the uh the

194
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,200
price at the expiration right at the

195
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,720
expiry.

196
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:42,880
So the payout is s uh uh s minus k where

197
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,040
k is a strike agreed price right and uh

198
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,800
for forwards the agreement uh is that

199
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,079
the strike is set in such a way that it

200
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,560
costs you nothing to enter it today

201
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,800
you basically say we agree with you

202
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,000
today for a zero price that

203
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,639
I'll buy the stock at the price K,

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,279
right?

205
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:15,760
Uh so uh quite useful diagram is the the

206
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:19,279
payout that's uh that's sorry that's a

207
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,120
blue line. So it's in our case it's S

208
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,320
minus K. So that's forward.

209
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:31,760
Uh now call option.

210
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:35,440
Call option is an option to buy

211
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,680
a stock at price K. Right? So basically

212
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,680
at expiry

213
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:47,160
you will decide are you buying the stock

214
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,160
at price K

215
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,360
or if it's if you don't want to you you

216
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,240
won't. And generally speaking, if the

217
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,240
stock ends at the money higher than the

218
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,519
strike, you will buy it, right? Because

219
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,360
it will be cheaper. And if uh if the

220
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,839
stock uh uh ends uh below the strike

221
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,800
price, it you will say thank you very

222
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,480
much. And the contract will expire

223
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,839
worthless. So this is the payout at the

224
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,320
end. And this is the price of the call

225
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,000
option today, right? Obviously it is not

226
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,800
zero price contract. It is you you will

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,560
pay some money to enter into this

228
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,480
contract. Right?

229
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,000
Uh

230
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,680
another

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,839
usual and simple contract would be a put

232
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:45,200
option

233
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,600
uh which is an agreement to to sell

234
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,760
uh the uh it's kind of opposite right

235
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:57,519
it's uh it basically prevents if if the

236
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,440
uh the option uh the uh stock is too

237
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,639
high you won't sell it. If if the stock

238
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,800
ends low, you will sell it for a higher

239
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:13,360
price. So it is basically

240
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:16,560
insurance kind of insurance of uh uh of

241
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,560
against stock falling below uh below the

242
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,519
the strike price. And here is the the

243
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,800
current price. And what we'll be doing

244
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,279
today is deriving these curves, deriving

245
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,079
the current price of price today for the

246
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,880
options and the forwards.

247
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,880
And what we'll see

248
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,880
is

249
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,880
a few observations that

250
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,880
uh

251
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:52,000
the only uh what will matter it is

252
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:55,199
assumptions on uh on the dynamics of the

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,519
stock price. Some assumptions on how the

254
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,399
stock behaves, some assumptions on

255
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:05,519
interest rates.

256
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:07,680
uh and and uh given given that there

257
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,519
will be no uncertainty in in the price

258
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,160
of the derivative and this was believe

259
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,240
me this wasn't clear to market

260
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,240
participants before black and shows

261
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,240
uh

262
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,360
u and uh the u

263
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,199
the Another

264
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,760
important observation which we'll see

265
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,320
that the uh the preferences of market

266
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,040
participants will not matter. It's you

267
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,199
know similarly in to our horse racing

268
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:49,839
example we'll be able to to uh to find

269
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:53,839
the riskless ways to replicate replicate

270
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,639
the price the price of the option.

271
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,639
All right. So

272
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,560
let's start

273
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,320
with uh with a simple example of the

274
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,279
forward

275
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,600
and uh let's start from from a discrete

276
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:14,880
uh uh time and and and stock prices and

277
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,399
uh because it's it's simple simpler to

278
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,480
understand

279
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,880
and uh so what does it mean is that

280
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,360
right now we

281
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:31,079
uh have

282
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,079
some price of our stock s0.

283
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:40,160
Uh we have price of our contract f0

284
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,120
in in the case of uh of the forward. We

285
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,480
assume that it's zero, right? Because we

286
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,440
we assume that we uh the we are entering

287
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,120
at the forward contract at zero price,

288
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,279
right? And there are two outcomes that

289
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:01,360
we are only one step away. So some time

290
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:05,280
dt to the future. And uh at the outcome

291
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,559
the the outcomes either s1 or s_ub_2. So

292
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,199
the stock can go either here and here.

293
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,880
And our derivative

294
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,039
according to our formula will be will go

295
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,520
to

296
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,520
s1 minus k

297
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,520
or

298
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,919
s2 - k

299
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,760
right

300
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:35,120
so again from naive perspective one can

301
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,799
say well there is some probability for

302
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,320
stock to go to go up to to s1 one and

303
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,320
some probability 1 minus P for stock to

304
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,240
go down.

305
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:52,760
And one would say that we can assume

306
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,760
that our price now

307
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,080
is actually expected value

308
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:04,320
with this probability of

309
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,320
uh of the value of our derivative at the

310
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
end.

311
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,480
Right. And so it will be

312
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,280
P * F_sub_1 -

313
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,280
1 - P * F_sub_2

314
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,559
U

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,559
and well

316
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:38,799
P * S1 - K

317
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:42,559
plus 1 - P *

318
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:46,559
That's 2 minus k

319
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,320
and from uh from here we can actually

320
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,039
well what we what we are looking for is

321
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,039
the agreed price on our forward right so

322
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:58,840
we can say that our strike price should

323
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,840
be PS1

324
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,559
uh plus

325
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,640
1 minus p

326
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,600
* s2

327
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,160
But we don't know the the probability

328
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,679
and in fact that's as we'll see in a

329
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,640
second that's not a good way to approach

330
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,360
it.

331
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,360
And why? Here is why

332
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,080
because here is a suggestion what we

333
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,240
should do. Here is a suggestion how we

334
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,760
we can construct

335
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:38,480
a riskneutral portfolio here. So

336
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,000
that's what we are going to do.

337
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,520
So at time zero

338
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,840
we enter into uh into forward contract

339
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,960
with strike K and we'll in a second

340
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,760
we'll see what this strike K will be at

341
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,640
zero at zero cost cost right

342
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,600
enter

343
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,720
forward

344
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,720
at at zero cost

345
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,160
and we will borrow

346
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,160
money to buy to buy the stock. So we are

347
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
borrow

348
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:27,520
as zero. So we'll buy we borrow money in

349
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:29,600
a bank and uh and buy a stock

350
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,559
for a minute. Let's assume that our

351
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,480
interest rates are zero for for

352
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,919
simplicity. Okay. So what happens at

353
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:43,640
expiry? What happens? It's time time

354
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,640
equals zero time equal dt.

355
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:54,240
So at at at expiry what we'll do

356
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:59,559
we will deliver the stock right because

357
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,559
we have it deliver s

358
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,919
and we'll receive our strike guys

359
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,280
and repays the loan.

360
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:27,200
So basically what happens here we we we

361
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,280
borrow here we had a stock we came here

362
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,039
we delivered the stock this cost nothing

363
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:37,200
so we receive K that's a grid a grid

364
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:39,440
strike and we repay the loan which we

365
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,280
started here it because interest rate is

366
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,840
zero we it didn't change right if it

367
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:50,640
changed it will be discount some e to

368
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:53,280
the minus e to the rt t times s0.

369
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,720
So

370
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,039
now that's what we'll get here. And here

371
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,400
we started with zero, right? Because it

372
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,200
was we paid zero to enter. What can we

373
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,080
say about this?

374
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:13,360
Well, if this was greater than zero, we

375
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,159
we for sure receive money, right? There

376
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,400
is no other outcome.

377
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,159
If it's less than zero, we for sure lost

378
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,919
money.

379
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,240
No arbitrage assume will tell us that

380
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,480
neither is possible.

381
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,000
So because the price was initial price

382
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,280
was zero, this has to be zero

383
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
because this replicates our payoff.

384
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,880
So our strike

385
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,760
has to be as zero, right?

386
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,280
So if there are no interest rates, the

387
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,640
forward contract would just we we we

388
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,360
would agree to buy or sell the the the

389
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,600
price in the the stock in the future at

390
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,600
the current price if interest rates are

391
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
zero.

392
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,840
So no no no choice and we don't care

393
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,360
about real world probabilities

394
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,200
and we don't care about uh

395
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,240
about what what how the stock behaves in

396
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,240
in real uh in real life. We just

397
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,000
replicated everything. What's

398
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,799
interesting though? What interesting

399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,960
though we can find a probability

400
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:32,799
which will give us our uh our strike or

401
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,240
which will give us this formula. Right?

402
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,600
So what what will it be? Well, well, K

403
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,600
is is equal as zero

404
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:51,600
and uh so our P and I'll call it

405
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,080
neutral uh risk neutral prob probability

406
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,240
S1

407
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,760
uh plus

408
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,280
1 minus P N

409
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,280
S2

410
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Right.

411
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:13,880
And that's uh and we we can find our uh

412
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,880
PN from here.

413
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:24,039
S0 - S2

414
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,039
divided by S1 - S2.

415
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,600
Uh

416
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,520
what's interesting observation here?

417
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,279
First of all, that we can find this rift

418
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,080
neutral probabilities

419
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:40,000
and we uh we actually could price our uh

420
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,720
our forward contract using this

421
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,840
probabilities using this expected

422
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,720
expected payoff. The interesting the

423
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:53,200
most interesting part is that our

424
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,520
current stock price our underlying

425
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,120
under this riskneutral prob probability

426
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,760
is expected value of the future move of

427
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,080
the stock and that's what we will see.

428
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,240
So that that's basically our riskneutral

429
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,080
measure. Then that's how we will be

430
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,480
looking for our risk neutral measure

431
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,960
because

432
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:18,400
we can always find a measure which

433
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:22,320
implies that our our current underlying

434
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,279
value asset value is expected value of

435
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,120
the future payoff and that's a measure

436
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,120
which we can use to price the

437
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,120
derivatives.

438
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,600
Okay. So, let's move to something more

439
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,600
interesting

440
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,600
and let's

441
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
do

442
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,679
and

443
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,159
call option but still in in discrete

444
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,159
time, right?

445
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:05,799
So

446
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,799
our call option payoff would be maximum

447
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:16,279
of the the value at expiration minus k

448
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,279
and zero. Right?

449
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,279
Right. That's is here. That's that's our

450
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:28,880
payoff. That's the hockey stick.

451
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,200
We still assume for for this exercise,

452
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,480
let's still assume interest rates uh

453
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,880
zero. So uh our diagram will be our

454
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,440
value of call option which we will be

455
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:47,840
looking for uh at time zero. Our stock

456
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,640
is zero. Uh S0 stock goes to S1 or to

457
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:55,840
S2.

458
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:58,159
Uh and our value of our call

459
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,080
will go

460
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,440
uh we we assume that s_ub_1 is greater

461
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,520
than s0, s_ub_2 is less than uh zero. So

462
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,080
here uh value of uh of our option will

463
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,919
be what?

464
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,919
S t minus k, right?

465
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,960
And

466
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,520
value of our call option here will be

467
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,440
>> zero right because it will be this this

468
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,400
thing.

469
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,799
Okay good. So now

470
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,000
what we want to do

471
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,000
we want to to find a replicating

472
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
portfolio.

473
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,000
Uh and here is suggestion how so

474
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,400
replicating portfolio in the case of

475
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,159
forward was stock itself right it it it

476
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,399
was rep replicating the the payout. Now

477
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,840
my suggestion is to do the following.

478
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:03,440
Our replicating portfolio would be some

479
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,440
amount of cash and some amount of stock,

480
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,440
right?

481
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,640
And

482
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,679
we we want to find these values of of

483
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,799
cash and how much stock we need such

484
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,799
that our

485
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:34,240
our option payoff is replicated here,

486
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,080
right?

487
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Well, we we certainly can can do it uh

488
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,880
in in this simple case, right? Because

489
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:53,600
well, in the beginning

490
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:57,520
our our portfolio will be B 0 plus A S0.

491
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,679
At the end it will be B1

492
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,880
plus S1

493
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:08,559
or B2 plus A S2.

494
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,039
Right? And our condition of replication

495
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,919
is that in this state it should be equal

496
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,919
to this. Right?

497
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,440
And in this state it should be equal to

498
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,440
this because we are replicating our

499
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,440
payoff.

500
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,200
And let's notice

501
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,760
that because our interest rate is zero

502
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,120
again, this thing doesn't doesn't change

503
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,120
because it's just cash, right?

504
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,600
Well,

505
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,279
nice nice and easy. uh from here we can

506
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,200
find that our a well if we subtract this

507
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,760
equation from this equation I mean we

508
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,080
have two equations with two unknowns so

509
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,039
b 0 is one unknown and the second

510
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,840
unknown is a so from here we can easily

511
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:10,080
find that a is equal s1 minus k

512
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,919
divided by s1 minus s2

513
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,000
right

514
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,399
and uh b 0

515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,640
B 0

516
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:25,520
is equal

517
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:29,360
S2 * K - S1

518
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,000
/ S1 - S_UB_2

519
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,120
and

520
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,480
knowing that if we replicate it the same

521
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,240
as before if we replicate it the port we

522
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:47,440
have a replication portfolio that's what

523
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:50,320
uh uh where it should be uh uh here and

524
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,840
this is our C 0 and that's what we are

525
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,919
looking right we are looking for the

526
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,880
value of our option at time zero

527
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,399
so

528
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,600
our C 0

529
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,799
is equal to a

530
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,799
S0 minus S2

531
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,720
or

532
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,720
it is

533
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,440
uh

534
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,600
s1 - k

535
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:33,240
divided by s_ub_1 - s_ub_2

536
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,240
* s0 minus s_ub_2.

537
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,120
Okay. So basically by the same

538
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:45,200
replication argument we were able to to

539
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:50,760
find uh uh to find uh our value. Now

540
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,760
coming back to our risk neutral.

541
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,519
Sure enough, if we use this this same

542
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,919
probability

543
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,519
which is derived from from expected

544
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,679
value of of the stock, the price of our

545
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,679
C 0

546
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,480
is actually

547
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,240
P neutral

548
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,240
times ST minus K

549
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,519
plus 1 - P neutral

550
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,760
time zero.

551
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,840
Right? So if we know this probability

552
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,039
and we can derive it from here instead

553
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,720
of doing all this difficult machinery,

554
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,320
we can just take the payoff and take

555
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,519
expected value of our payoff using this

556
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,399
probability and get the value of our uh

557
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,399
our derivative. Now

558
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,320
all right.

559
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,039
So that's discrete world.

560
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,159
Uh and yeah so

561
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:17,039
they just for your reference here it is

562
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,519
the same set of formulas for for any

563
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,799
for any payout.

564
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,519
Uh and it one other interesting

565
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:29,760
uh useful

566
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,000
uh comment here is that we started with

567
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:36,159
replicating for portfolio. So we we

568
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,799
started with some cash and some stock in

569
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,039
order to replicate the uh the the value

570
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,519
of our option in on the next step.

571
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:51,960
Right? On the other hand, one can

572
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,960
rewrite it and say that this portfolio

573
00:33:52,799 --> 00:34:00,880
is because this is just cash. This is

574
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,799
riskless portfolio

575
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,600
and we we will see that just in a second

576
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,440
that sometimes it's more convenient

577
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,200
instead of talking about replicating

578
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,000
portfolios about talking the portfolios

579
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,280
without risk. So we basically form a

580
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,480
portfolio of option of full value of

581
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,200
option and some stock such the

582
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,200
combination is riskless.

583
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:35,679
Okay. So that's our discrete world.

584
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,679
With that, let's move on to continuous

585
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,679
world.

586
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:49,679
So and in continuous world for today

587
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,679
we'll be looking we we'll be working

588
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,720
with

589
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,160
logn normal dynamics

590
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,280
but we'll see that it's not absolutely

591
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:06,680
crucial is just nice example once again

592
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,680
and logn normal dynamic is basically

593
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,560
a dynamic which implies ize that there

594
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,520
is some

595
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,520
some growth and there is some random

596
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,520
component.

597
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:30,920
Well, one can also write

598
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,920
uh it in this form

599
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:48,480
and let's talk a little bit about DW

600
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:52,240
what what it is. Uh so uh DW is uh

601
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,359
random walk inner process. So expected

602
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,720
value of DW

603
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,560
is equal to to zero and standard

604
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,880
deviation

605
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,880
of DW

606
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,400
is equal to square root of DT

607
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,400
and that's what always

608
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,079
bothers me. Why standard deviation has

609
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,760
to be square root of DT? Why why do we

610
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,640
know that? Well, and here is a handwavy

611
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,760
reason without any measure theory or

612
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,920
anything else is the following that so

613
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,720
our

614
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:41,040
suppose we have n

615
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:43,200
dt steps right our random walk had nine

616
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,920
n steps

617
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:53,160
right so

618
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:53,160
the collection of those will be DW0 DW1

619
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,520
so on and dw

620
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,640
and the uh no not equal. So our dwn the

621
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:13,160
final value after n steps it will be sum

622
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,160
of all the smaller steps.

623
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,200
Right? So what's expected value of

624
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:33,000
WN?

625
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,000
Well, it is sum of the expected values

626
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,040
of all DWS

627
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,960
and each of them is zero. So it is zero.

628
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,480
It's in fact Martin Gale, right? It

629
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,560
stays zero. Well, and what is the

630
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,800
standard deviation

631
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,800
or variance

632
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:04,320
uh of our DWN?

633
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,119
Well, it will be sum of squared

634
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,640
of each step.

635
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,680
Uh

636
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,680
yeah, and what I forgot to say to tell

637
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,680
here

638
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,440
Is that

639
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,240
probability

640
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,240
of us going

641
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,880
up? Uh

642
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,880
we we we are going by one either up or

643
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,880
down.

644
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,520
And on each step

645
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:50,480
uh it is 1/2 with probability 1/2 we go

646
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:54,119
up or or down. And correlation

647
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,119
our our steps

648
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,560
uh

649
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,359
are not correlated. Right? That's

650
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,800
important. So then the the variance

651
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:21,760
uh here will be

652
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:23,680
sum of expected values of t wi

653
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,680
squared

654
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,000
each of them will be one with

655
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:35,079
probability with probability 12.

656
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,079
So uh it will be

657
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,359
it will be n right so with probability

658
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,040
1/2 it is one with probability 1/2 it's

659
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:55,040
minus one so sum of squares will be all

660
00:39:49,040 --> 00:40:01,200
ones so n after n steps it will be n

661
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:05,040
okay fine now let's uh put our n steps

662
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,920
on a on a finite period of time, right?

663
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,920
Let's

664
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,920
assume

665
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,200
uh le let's uh let's assume that

666
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,680
we have a final period of time and we

667
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:34,960
split it and uh and n equal

668
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,119
periods of delta t of small delta

669
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,040
And we also let let's assume that

670
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:44,480
instead of doing the steps of one uh and

671
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:48,520
minus one uh

672
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,520
let's assume that

673
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:59,440
they are some number D right

674
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,079
plus or minus D right with probability

675
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,640
uh

676
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,640
h Sorry.

677
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:17,119
Okay. So, expected value of of our

678
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:22,680
random walk still stays zero and our

679
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,680
variance now becomes uh becomes what?

680
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,040
sum of 12 d^2

681
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,040
+ 12

682
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,040
d^2

683
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,200
right

684
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,200
so n d^2

685
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:50,640
and our n we we assume that it is just

686
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,200
split

687
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,880
uh period of time. So

688
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,400
t d ^2 divided by delta t. Right? So

689
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,839
basically what what I'm trying to say

690
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,480
that if we put our steps on a on a

691
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,920
period of time that's what's our

692
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:14,079
variance. And now if we make the steps

693
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,200
smaller the the time steps smaller and

694
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,920
the space steps smaller as well right

695
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:23,040
we're kind of taking intofinity. We we

696
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,520
make we are taking a limit over the

697
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,520
finite period of time

698
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:35,440
and the only way for this to stay finite

699
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:40,240
or n zero is for this to be of order of

700
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:45,319
magnitude of square root of t.

701
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,319
So a long winded

702
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,240
uh question

703
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,760
uh long winded answer is for

704
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,839
for why

705
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
standard deviation of our brownian

706
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,200
motion has to be square root of t

707
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,560
because otherwise we either will have

708
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,839
zero zero variance or exploding process.

709
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,200
So for this process not to explode

710
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,359
this has to be true.

711
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,960
All right. Uh

712
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,599
now another observation before we go to

713
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,079
uh to option pricing

714
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,400
uh is to

715
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,720
to talk about Taylor formula and eto

716
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,720
formula as

717
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,720
at a followup to it. Right.

718
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,880
So if if if our life

719
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:52,960
uh was deterministic and there was a a

720
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:58,040
function of two uh two variables

721
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,040
and s and s and t

722
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,000
then our tailor formula to the first

723
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,800
degree or to the second degree let's

724
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,800
let's write it

725
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,920
right? We'll take the partial

726
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,520
derivatives

727
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,079
with all with both respect of both and

728
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,839
then we'll have second derivatives,

729
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:34,800
right? So 12 of

730
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:40,319
d2f by dt squared

731
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:48,520
dt^ 2 + 12

732
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:48,520
d2 f by d s 2 d s 2

733
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,560
uh plus

734
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,560
mix derivative

735
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,319
right? So this is to second degree plus

736
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,319
plus delta. Right? Uh this is to the

737
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:20,160
second degree. Now in our uh in our

738
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,880
stochastic world these two terms have

739
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,000
kind of different magnitude right. So

740
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,599
this the deterministic term is of

741
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,960
magnitude dt and uh and stochastic term

742
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:37,839
is of of mag magnitude of square root

743
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:41,040
right. So if we go back to our

744
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,440
uh our tailor formula and still and and

745
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,839
would like to to have expansion to the

746
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,319
first to the first degree what what

747
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:52,760
we'll have to do

748
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,760
so in our stochcastic world.

749
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,720
So this is the first degree right? So

750
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,720
this we keep

751
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:15,440
this is first degree or

752
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,440
le at least less uh first degree or less

753
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,079
right because our ds is dt plus this is

754
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,680
of order of magnitude of square root dt

755
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,680
right so this will keep

756
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,680
completely

757
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:37,280
and now if we Go to mixed terms. This is

758
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:42,960
second degree squarely.

759
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:46,000
Get rid of it. Now uh this is certainly

760
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,359
more than first degree. So get rid of

761
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,119
it. But here something is left and what

762
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:56,880
is left is is square of this roughly

763
00:46:53,119 --> 00:47:01,280
speaking. Right? So we'll have to have a

764
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,960
term which is coming from uh from ds

765
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,560
squared.

766
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:13,760
So which will be

767
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:17,200
12 of d2 f by ds^ 2

768
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:20,319
and from uh from d s 2 the first term

769
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:24,800
will be dt ^ 2 not not interesting the

770
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:29,760
mixed term will be dt * dw will be uh

771
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:32,720
more less than dt but uh the square of

772
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,760
dw will be exactly on the of the order

773
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:40,640
magnitude of dt. Right? So here will be

774
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:44,520
sigma squar s^ 2 dt

775
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,520
uh ds^ squ sorry

776
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:53,119
right and so the and this is called

777
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:56,560
etheros's formula very important uh for

778
00:47:53,119 --> 00:48:00,000
stoastic calculus and this is quick and

779
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:01,760
dirty derivation

780
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,720
of it.

781
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,720
Okay. Now,

782
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:12,480
uh let's move on

783
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,319
uh to our

784
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:19,880
to our

785
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:19,880
No, this this will leave probably.

786
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:27,480
So, we'll need this this

787
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,480
but this we don't need.

788
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,200
So let's move to pricing.

789
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,920
So we still want to price

790
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,920
a

791
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:54,400
some claim derivative claim

792
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:58,559
and we'll call it f in our case and

793
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,559
we'll form a replicating portfolio.

794
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,240
And as before, our replicating portfolio

795
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,559
will consist of some stock,

796
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,559
some cash.

797
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,400
And what we want to do is to replicate

798
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:31,079
our uh value of our claim on each step

799
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,079
on each step dt. Right?

800
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,960
Now

801
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,200
let's do the trick which we did before

802
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,160
which let's rearrange this. Right? So

803
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,160
let's notice that

804
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,920
a s t

805
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:58,040
minus f of t. So the combination

806
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,040
or f minus a sorry more

807
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:08,520
that this combination of uh of our

808
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,520
derivative and stock is riskless.

809
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:17,599
And what does it mean that uh well now

810
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:20,480
we are we'll assume the uh

811
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,119
that interest rates are not zero. What

812
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,599
does it mean? It means that

813
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:30,160
this thing if it's riskless it has to

814
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,160
grow with time as e to the e to the rt

815
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,960
right

816
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,960
by definition. So

817
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,960
BT

818
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,599
is equal e to the RT

819
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:50,000
times B 0. Right? So we started our

820
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:56,400
strategy at time zero and since then our

821
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:58,640
cash is growing with interest rate T.

822
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,960
And what does this mean? Well, this

823
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,960
means that

824
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:09,920
our DB is deterministic function. No, no

825
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:14,359
need for e or anything like this.

826
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,359
And we all can differentiate,

827
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,839
exponentials.

828
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:29,440
So, trivial mass. That's how RB works.

829
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,119
So now that's so let's try to

830
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,200
differentiate the whole thing. We we

831
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,640
know the right side because it's

832
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:42,040
deterministic it will be this.

833
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,040
So the derivative

834
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,800
of our riskless portfolio

835
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:58,839
will be r times

836
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,839
uh our riskless portfolio

837
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,520
times dt.

838
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,800
Good. Now

839
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:14,000
we'll keep it as a right hand side and

840
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:20,520
for this we'll use our our

841
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,520
uh uh eido eidto's formula right

842
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:29,440
well let's do that so we continue to

843
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,640
differentiate that and we get

844
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,599
df minus a

845
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:39,040
ds s

846
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:42,880
and our f is stochastic. We use our

847
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:46,160
ether's formula will be

848
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,040
d of dt

849
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,200
* dt

850
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,200
plus

851
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,880
df

852
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,599
ds

853
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:03,359
* ds

854
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:09,119
plus our stochastic term plus 12

855
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:12,359
D2F by D S^ 2

856
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,359
D S^2

857
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:21,880
and we don't forget to subtract this

858
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:30,000
and if we just continue continue further

859
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:34,559
and start collecting terms.

860
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:37,680
So we we'll expand our uh ds according

861
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:41,280
to our formula right and we'll collect

862
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:45,760
terms with the certain terms with dt and

863
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,839
uncertain terms with our dw right so if

864
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:53,480
we're collecting our terms with dt here

865
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:53,480
it will be df by dt

866
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:07,520
plus

867
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:09,839
12 uh uh 12 coming from ds^ squ and ds^2

868
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:14,079
remember it will be

869
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:19,359
sigma^ 2 s^ 2 dt it comes from from this

870
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:22,960
only right so it will be

871
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:26,559
oh so sorry sorry well yeah not okay

872
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,880
that's fine plus 12

873
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:35,280
d2f f

874
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:38,640
by d s 2 sigma squ s 2 and I missed this

875
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:42,960
one and if we are collecting the dt

876
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:47,839
terms it it has to be that right

877
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:50,240
uh plus df by ds

878
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:52,000
times mu s

879
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,800
right

880
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,839
and we should not forget dt term from

881
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,440
here minus

882
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,480
a

883
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:08,640
mu s

884
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:12,400
and that's completes our dt term. Right?

885
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:16,240
Now let's see what happens

886
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,040
with our dw term.

887
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,440
Uh well dw term will be partially from

888
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:25,119
here right?

889
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,280
DF by DS

890
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:30,240
sigma S

891
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,760
from here right

892
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,839
minus

893
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,599
part part from here a sigma

894
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,240
S

895
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:43,359
and this is equal DW

896
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:47,839
uh times DW right and what it is equal

897
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:51,680
to well it is equal to this right yeah

898
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,799
>> um how come we can say that dw equals dt

899
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,319
because I thought we just knew the

900
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,920
standard deviation was the square root

901
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:59,200
of dt but like

902
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,200
>> so dw^ squared is dt

903
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,799
>> but like I thought w was random. I

904
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,079
thought dw was random. So how can you

905
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,839
say that when you square it you get

906
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,000
something deterministic?

907
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:12,799
Uh well that that this is more of a

908
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,160
notation

909
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:21,359
but uh but yeah we we kind of yeah it is

910
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:24,079
not very uh very rigorous notation

911
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:28,240
but that's basically

912
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,880
what uh what uh what it's formula tells

913
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,760
you.

914
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,920
>> Okay.

915
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,319
>> Right. So if you go into uh the strict

916
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,720
proof that that's what you'll get

917
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:41,359
basically for for the second for the

918
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,160
square term right but yet

919
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:47,440
>> add to that when we talked about brownie

920
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:50,960
motion the quadratic variation of

921
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,559
brownian motion is constant

922
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,520
over time intervals.

923
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,160
>> I see. Okay.

924
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,520
>> And so over the infinite intervals.

925
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,440
>> Okay. That makes sense.

926
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,559
>> Yeah. It's combination of infinite

927
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,440
decimal and the fact that the the yeah

928
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,280
the that the standard deviation is of

929
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,280
order of magnitude but yes you are right

930
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,280
it is uh it is kind of slope annotation

931
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,240
uh okay so and this is equal to

932
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:25,240
RF

933
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:25,240
right uh minus R S R A S

934
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:33,119
uh DT T

935
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,440
and because we we knew that this this

936
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:39,280
part is deterministic, right? So there

937
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:43,280
are no DW terms on on this side.

938
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:46,480
So what does it mean? That this has to

939
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:51,680
be equal to this,

940
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:55,599
right? And this has to be equal to zero

941
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:58,960
because right right hand side here

942
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:03,920
is completely deterministic.

943
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:06,400
So uncertainty has to disappear. Why it

944
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,280
disappears by construction because we

945
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,599
from the very beginning we said that we

946
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,319
want to find such an A and that's what

947
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:18,040
we'll get just in a second that this

948
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:18,040
portfolio is riskless

949
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:24,240
or another another way that we can

950
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:27,680
replicate our uh our our derivative. So

951
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:36,119
if this is equal to zero

952
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:36,119
then our a is equal to uh df by ds

953
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:47,040
right

954
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:49,760
and we are done right so what we are

955
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:56,440
done in a sense

956
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:56,440
that we arrive at the following equation

957
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,920
basically. Uh where should I write? How

958
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,920
about this?

959
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:18,680
So our main equation will be this equal

960
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,680
to this. But we'll substitute a

961
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:25,680
and let me write it here. The equation

962
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,319
which we arrive at

963
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,839
df by

964
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:33,680
dt + 12

965
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:36,720
the second

966
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:41,920
f by d s^ 2

967
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:43,520
sigma^ 2 s^ 2 is equal to rf

968
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,920
right

969
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:50,720
minus r

970
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:54,079
df by ds * s

971
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:57,200
And this is the black shells equation

972
00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:01,440
right. So that's what we are looking for

973
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:05,200
and that's what we will be solving.

974
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:08,160
So just

975
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:12,160
to give

976
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:17,119
yeah so in the slides there are nicer

977
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:20,559
and more cleaner write up. Um

978
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:24,720
yeah. So the basically what what we

979
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:28,960
found out that any

980
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:33,280
derivative claim any pay payoff has to

981
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:35,359
satisfy this this this equation.

982
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,640
Well under assumptions of our log normal

983
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,400
mo motion. If if we assume some other

984
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,319
dynamics of the stock, the equation will

985
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:47,040
be different but we still can derive it

986
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:49,599
in in in a similar manner. Right?

987
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:53,200
And but but the beauty of it that any

988
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:56,880
derivative claim uh any uh payout at any

989
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:00,240
time uh time before expiry has to

990
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,680
satisfy the this this equation. More

991
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,680
moreover this equation doesn't depend on

992
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:09,680
our drift

993
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:12,319
on our real world drift

994
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:17,119
and we we'll come back to this uh come

995
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,880
back to this shortly. Uh so so it

996
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:23,760
doesn't matter what what matters is

997
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:26,160
volatility right uh and uh that we we'll

998
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,559
touch upon hopefully we'll have time to

999
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,680
touch upon it further in black shaw

1000
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,799
theory it is assumed constant but it

1001
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:37,359
doesn't have to be it it you can assume

1002
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:40,240
some function or you can assume this to

1003
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:42,559
be stochastic itself which will make the

1004
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,640
uh the equations more complicated and

1005
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,559
more complicated to solve But but once

1006
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,520
again

1007
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:52,400
uh so and that's uh that's what uh

1008
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:56,319
Fisher Black Martin Scholes and Robert

1009
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,960
Merton discovered or published in their

1010
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:02,000
1973 paper. Believe it or not, it was

1011
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,559
quite controversial because uh and

1012
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,920
actually wasn't very much applauded at

1013
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,240
this time, but was recognized by a Nobel

1014
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:16,000
Prize in 97.

1015
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:18,720
Uh and they always fun fact to to say

1016
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,920
that all three of them are associated

1017
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:27,920
with MIT. uh um um Bob Mertin is still I

1018
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,760
think a professor at at MIT which is

1019
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,680
obviously

1020
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:35,760
quite quite nice to to talk about it in

1021
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:41,760
these walls.

1022
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:45,160
So uh now uh coming uh well maybe a

1023
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,160
couple of remarks

1024
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,319
uh yeah uh yeah so v said that so any

1025
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:56,720
derivative satisfy this equation it

1026
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:59,359
doesn't depend on real world uh drift we

1027
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,200
obtained it this equation by by

1028
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:04,640
replicating strategy and that's the most

1029
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,400
important uh the the

1030
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,480
other beauty of it. It's not only

1031
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,040
replicating strategy, it's also a

1032
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:15,680
hedging strategy. Right? So if we know

1033
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:18,480
our A which is actually derivative of

1034
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:22,640
our current price with respect to stock,

1035
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:24,799
we can hedge out all the risk. Right? So

1036
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:27,760
basically by holding option and some

1037
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:30,000
amount of stock this this amount of

1038
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,400
stock our portfolio becomes riskless

1039
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,599
which is very important practical

1040
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:39,359
conclusion. Uh the more mathematical or

1041
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:42,400
technical uh observations are that this

1042
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:45,599
is actually a form of heat equation and

1043
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:48,559
a a good technical exercise would be to

1044
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:51,760
uh to uh to figure out what what change

1045
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:54,400
of variables uh gives you uh the heat

1046
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,799
equation and this is a very wellstudied

1047
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:02,240
and solved problem even though it will

1048
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:04,559
be it has to be numerical. Um so as any

1049
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:08,799
partial differential equation to solve

1050
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:12,559
it uh it will require uh it will require

1051
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:15,280
the uh initial or actually in this case

1052
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,680
final conditions and boundary

1053
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,319
conditions. And what is our final

1054
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:24,000
condition? Well our final condition is

1055
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:26,079
actually our final payoff

1056
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,839
which will be this. This is our final

1057
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:32,720
condition. This we know right. And what

1058
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:36,480
will be our boundary condition for for

1059
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:39,200
call will be that at zero uh the value

1060
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:42,960
of the call is zero.

1061
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:47,520
And the other B boundary condition would

1062
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:51,280
be uh would be that at infinity it is

1063
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,680
actually uh the approaches S as S as S

1064
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,520
as S as S as S as S as S as S as S as S

1065
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,720
s

1066
01:04:53,520 --> 01:05:01,720
minus K right

1067
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,720
uh and if we imply

1068
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,480
uh this

1069
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,920
boundary

1070
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:13,760
uh conditions and uh finite conditions

1071
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:17,599
and this is the conditions for for put

1072
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:20,240
we can uh derive uh the arrive to

1073
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:23,920
analytical or semianalytical formulas

1074
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,640
for for the prices. Of course it's

1075
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:31,680
expressed in the terms of uh uh error

1076
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:35,920
function which has to be tbulated. Um

1077
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,920
uh yeah uh in in more complicated cases

1078
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:42,079
in in the cases of more complicated

1079
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:44,240
dynamics uh of course the the formulas

1080
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,640
are not so nice and most probably it

1081
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:50,240
will require some numerical numerical

1082
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:52,559
integration and numerical uh procedures

1083
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:55,520
which is a big part of numerical

1084
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:59,119
finance. In fact, what I wanted to talk

1085
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:03,200
about is uh coming back to uh

1086
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:04,720
riskneutral pricing and let me

1087
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:08,680
uh

1088
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,680
uh let me

1089
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:16,640
do it here.

1090
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,839
Uh basically how how do we find our

1091
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,480
riskneutral measure and how do we find

1092
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:25,799
our riskneutral PDF?

1093
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,799
Well actually

1094
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:32,319
fine

1095
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:36,599
in the case of log normal it is pretty

1096
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,599
simple because

1097
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:44,920
well our ds

1098
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,920
is equal to

1099
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:53,920
mu s dt

1100
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:57,280
plus sigma s dw. W.

1101
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:01,599
So here is a nice trick. If we take

1102
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:04,160
expectation value of both sides,

1103
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:07,160
then we'll get a differential equation

1104
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,160
for

1105
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,720
well uh for

1106
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:16,480
expected value of this is zero, right?

1107
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:19,680
Because expected value of DW is is is

1108
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:24,599
equal is equal zero. So an expected

1109
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,599
value uh of this will be

1110
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,240
mud dt right.

1111
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,799
So nice differential equation for our

1112
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:40,880
expected value. So

1113
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:43,200
our expected the the expected value of

1114
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,920
of the stock

1115
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,920
should be equal to initial value of the

1116
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,920
stock

1117
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:58,319
time e to the mu t right but for our

1118
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:01,920
riskneutral assumptions

1119
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:06,799
remember so we said that in discrete

1120
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:09,359
case the whole point of uh

1121
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:13,039
riskneutral probability was that

1122
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:15,119
expected value of our stock

1123
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,319
should be

1124
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:21,359
our stock may be compounded by by

1125
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,640
interest rate right well when interest

1126
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:27,679
rate was zero it was constant

1127
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:31,199
it was so uh

1128
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:34,640
in in logn normal uh uh dynamics ds over

1129
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:39,679
s will be martingale martingale So this

1130
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:43,759
has to be equal to s e to the rt because

1131
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,799
in under risk neutral dynamics our stock

1132
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:49,920
has to be has to grow with r. So

1133
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:53,560
basically it tells us that mu has to be

1134
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,560
equal to r

1135
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:04,960
under our risk neutral measure.

1136
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:10,560
Right? So now okay mu is equal to r but

1137
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:15,440
uh but we can easily find a pdf

1138
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:17,440
of of this process at time t and that's

1139
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,480
what it is of log normal process

1140
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:27,719
basically right

1141
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:27,719
with uh with mu sub substituted by r.

1142
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,120
So

1143
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:36,480
yeah so

1144
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:42,719
mu substituted by r and what what I'm

1145
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:47,839
saying that now instead of solving

1146
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:51,920
our black shs equation for any claim our

1147
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:56,480
under uh logn normal dynamics we we

1148
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:58,960
could just take the our payoff and

1149
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,199
integrate it against this pd PDF the

1150
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,679
final PDF and get the value of the

1151
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:06,560
function now as is expected

1152
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,239
expected payoff under risk neutral

1153
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,920
measure

1154
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:16,960
and that's our risk neutral measure

1155
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:20,880
right so that's a nice benefit of course

1156
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:24,080
it is easier for log normal for other uh

1157
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,600
for other processes uh it is not that

1158
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,640
easy

1159
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,719
um but uh it's certainly an added

1160
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,480
benefit.

1161
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:36,400
Another

1162
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:40,480
uh another example which I want to give

1163
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:45,080
you in the past in the last 10 minutes

1164
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,080
is another replication example.

1165
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:50,640
Uh

1166
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:55,159
so

1167
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,159
let's form such a portfolio.

1168
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:06,120
Let's buy a call and sell a put.

1169
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:17,840
So what what what is it? Well, let's

1170
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,840
draw a diagram.

1171
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:25,040
And let's draw a diagram at time

1172
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:27,280
maturity t. Right? So we long a call.

1173
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:30,480
So with some strike K, right? So this is

1174
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:32,480
our strike K. So our call is looks like

1175
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,080
this.

1176
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:38,400
We short a put, right? So put would be

1177
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:42,239
like this. And short put it will flip

1178
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:45,440
it, right? So it's like this.

1179
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:48,960
How does it look?

1180
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:50,400
It looks like just like a forward,

1181
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,320
right?

1182
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:55,040
So

1183
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:58,320
at maturity

1184
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:00,800
by this portfolio has zero uncertainty.

1185
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:05,199
It's forward,

1186
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:07,520
right? So at any time before maturity,

1187
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:09,440
it has to be value the the forward value

1188
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:13,360
of the stock,

1189
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:18,000
right? So it it always has to be so at

1190
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:20,719
at maturity it is S t minus K.

1191
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,800
So uh well

1192
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:26,800
at maturity

1193
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,880
so at any point of time

1194
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,840
the difference

1195
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:34,239
of call and put

1196
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,719
has to be

1197
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:39,440
the difference of

1198
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:42,239
value of the current value of the stock

1199
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:46,600
and to tell the truth discounted value

1200
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,600
of of the strike. Right?

1201
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,679
T minus T

1202
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:57,360
and the beauty of it that we we made

1203
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:00,960
zero assumptions about dynamics of the

1204
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:03,040
of the stock here.

1205
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,880
This has to be true always. It's just

1206
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:09,040
how the payoffs look look like

1207
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:12,239
because we always know forward. It is

1208
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,800
only dependent on uh on uh interest

1209
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:18,080
rate. it doesn't depend on uh on

1210
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:20,640
dynamics of the stock and this portfolio

1211
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,040
doesn't depend on dynamics of the stock

1212
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,920
and it's quite powerful because it

1213
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,600
basically tells you that if this is

1214
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,440
different at any point of time you have

1215
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:34,239
an arbitrage

1216
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:36,480
and to illustrate that I actually

1217
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:42,480
uh

1218
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:46,480
went oh sorry uh went to Bloomberg

1219
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:51,040
took real prices of calls and puts. This

1220
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:56,159
is Apple stock a while ago admittedly.

1221
01:13:51,040 --> 01:14:00,400
uh and uh here I I literally plotted the

1222
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:03,679
data from here for call and for for put

1223
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,640
and literally summed it up and you see

1224
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:10,080
that it it is a straight line and no

1225
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,679
surprise because if if it w wouldn't be

1226
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,800
it would be an arbitrage people will

1227
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:19,280
jump on it immediately people check for

1228
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:21,440
it all the time the beauty of it that

1229
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,640
the the dynamics of The stock is not log

1230
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:28,239
normal and how can we see it? Well, I

1231
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:32,080
also plotted here implied volatility for

1232
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:33,679
I think I did it for call here and if it

1233
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,440
would be log normal the volatility

1234
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:39,280
should be straight line and it is not

1235
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:42,000
right. That's why we need more

1236
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,640
complicated models for for stock

1237
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,520
dynamics. that why black trolls is a

1238
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,440
nice example but but we need stocastic

1239
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,640
relativity

1240
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:56,560
uh or or others jump diffusion is by the

1241
01:14:52,640 --> 01:15:00,000
way uh if tricky thing because the

1242
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:04,080
Martin gales with jumps don't really

1243
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:09,600
work so the the life becomes becomes uh

1244
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:12,400
more complicated so um yeah so that

1245
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,440
that's a nice another nice example of

1246
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:19,440
replication, right? So, and in general,

1247
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:22,000
that's how a lot of things function. You

1248
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,080
what you try to do, you look at the

1249
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
payout of a portfolio and you try to

1250
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,159
replicate the payout with the

1251
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,640
instruments which you have at hand or at

1252
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:34,560
least approximate the payout because if

1253
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:37,280
you did it, you know the price now

1254
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,159
or you know arbitrage. The the other way

1255
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:43,440
to do it is for some form some

1256
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:47,520
complicated portfolio

1257
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:50,400
and find misplacement right and that

1258
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:54,960
then it becomes arbitrage. Nowadays it's

1259
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:57,199
practically impossible but but

1260
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:00,560
people did a lot of things with more

1261
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:06,320
complicated options even 15 20 years a

1262
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:09,040
well 25 years ago I think Jake uh has a

1263
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,000
good story about that how he was

1264
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,920
starting in effect options. Yeah the

1265
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,719
just in another illustration I did the

1266
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,800
same for IBM stock and yeah sure enough

1267
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:21,199
it's the same straight line. I didn't

1268
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,800
plot the implied wall, but it's probably

1269
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:29,360
even uglier here.

1270
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:34,000
Um, yeah, we're about at time. Uh, but I

1271
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:38,640
would leave you uh with a little bit

1272
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,600
food for thought here. Uh, so this is

1273
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,000
called digital option. The payout payout

1274
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,560
of digital option or all or nothing

1275
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,760
option, right? It's basically either

1276
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:53,199
pays you zero if you end up uh out of

1277
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:56,719
the money or it pays you one if you end

1278
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:58,400
up in the money. Right?

1279
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:02,719
Uh

1280
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:05,760
the uh this is how black shs would price

1281
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:08,320
it that this is actually uh how coal

1282
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:12,159
spread looks from uh uh from the data

1283
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:15,520
which I just showed you uh pretty close

1284
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:17,920
to this. So my challenge to you is find

1285
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,760
a replicating portfolio

1286
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,920
which which prices it digital because I

1287
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,760
claim that you don't need to have a

1288
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,640
dynamic of the stock or do any

1289
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:32,000
complicated things here. You can

1290
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:34,159
replicate this uh this payout

1291
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,560
uh practically exactly actually

1292
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:40,880
approximate the the payout uh and uh

1293
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,000
that's how actually how people hedge

1294
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,000
digital options.

1295
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:51,440
Um yeah so think about it. Um for with

1296
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,440
this let me stop stop stop stop stop

1297
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:51,440

an icon. He I mean not only he wrote the

1315
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:51,520
most famous derivatives pricing book uh

1317
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:58,800
and made a lot of contribution to

1318
01:18:54,159 --> 01:19:00,719
quantitative finance. So and I I we we

1319
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,560

1320
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,159

1323
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:13,800
