driven Urban insights uberto the screen

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,279
is yours hi gram thank you thank you

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,599
very much for offering us this floor

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,840
thank you for the introduction CHR and

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,679
good morning and good afternoon every

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,000
Everybody well I'm very happy to be here

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,719
and show you what we do at the senso

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,680
city lab uh let me just try to explain

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,239
you first of all where we are we are a

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,320
lab in the urban studies and planning

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,719
department at

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,480
MIT and what we are passionate is cities

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,879
of course but looking at cities through

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,520
the lens of digital Technologies today

18
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,680
we can look at cities like basically

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,239
living systems living organisms and for

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,239
doing this we actually need new new

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,200
types of approach if you look at cities

22
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,680
as living organisms you probably need a

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,159
biologist perspective you probably need

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,840
a sociologist perspective and this is

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,759
what we try to do in the lab we have a

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,680
huge team of people uh mainly in

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,320
Cambridge we have more than 50 people in

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,400
our lab and what I'm going to show to

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,600
you today is the collective effort of

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
all these great

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,040
researchers and by collaborating a lot

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,040
with cities we also have some

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,840
researchers located in some of the the

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,799
cities that we study most and those are

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,000
Amsterdam Dubai and Realo which are

36
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,399
cities where we develop what we call the

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,920
living Labs where not only we we're

38
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,079
allowed to experiment our work but most

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,040
importantly engage in a continuous

40
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,159
discussion with all the stakeholders of

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,360
the city from the city municipality down

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,360
to the entrepreneurial ecosystems and to

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,159
the

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,920
residents well we of course do this all

45
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,840
over the world with cities with people

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
and we do it also together with

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
different companies and we're very

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,119
grateful of course to to all the

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,360
companies that have supported and do

50
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,400
support our work uh uh and our research

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,519
with the cities and with also a lot of

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,519
research Partners around so today I'm

53
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm going to give you some examples of

54
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,560
our work and I try to categorize them in

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,000
in four chapters

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,760
basically according to the different

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,480
types of technology to different types

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,319
of AI that we're using

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,599
so the first one in this uh catalog of

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,080
different approaches to with AI to Urban

61
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,159
science is what we call Visual AI visual

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,159
AI is the technique of having a computer

63
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,080
to automatically understand what's

64
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,560
happening in an image you might be

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,920
familiar with something like uh like

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,120
it's shown in in this picture which is

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,480
simply understanding and uh uh and

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,360
Counting how many people how many cars

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,360
how many trees we have in a in an

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,879
image well this is of course a computer

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,080
science result but what if you apply to

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
urban planning and urban science what

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,440
are the interesting problems that you

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,480
can try to solve with this we started

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,840
doing this many years ago uh I'll show

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,239
you something old and something new that

77
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,680
we're doing one of the first question

78
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,799
that we investigated few years ago was

79
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,480
the following one we know that trees are

80
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,280
are very important

81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,000
to the the cities not only for

82
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,680
mitigating temperatures not only because

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,159
they're beautiful but because they

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,959
increase biodiversity and they they

85
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,599
reduce pollution but the question is how

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,840
can we quantify better quantify The

87
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,879
Greenery and its impact on the city so

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,200
initially we've done something quite

89
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,519
simple which was take a picture uh a

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,519
Google Street View picture so pictures

91
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,560
which are normally available and uh uh

92
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,920
in and everybody can can use and

93
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,920
download so take a picture select a

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,720
portion do some AI use some AI to Simply

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,400
quantify the green pixels the green area

96
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,560
and then do it for every picture in the

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,520
city meter by meter and create these

98
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,000
kind of maps this is a visible Greener

99
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,000
map that shows at your doorstep where

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
you live what's the visible green you do

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,199
it through the neighborhood throughout

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,600
the

103
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,720
city and by doing this you're also able

104
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,720
to compare different cities this was a

105
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,919
great tool that allowed people to really

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,720
see face to face and quantify their

107
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:51,080
exposure to Greenery in their cities

108
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,039
this had a huge social uh influence we

109
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,680
had people debating over social media

110
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,800
that their neighborhood was greener than

111
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,160
another another one that their city was

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,360
not green as another city and so this

113
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,880
actually changed developed a advocacy um

114
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,919
exercise of people that through data

115
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,960
empowered with data they were discussing

116
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,280
this this phenomena to the point that we

117
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,440
actually open sourced the algorithm and

118
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,160
now any City can run the algorithm uh

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,840
with kuop street view data and have

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,800
their City into the rank here so there

121
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,000
was few years ago but one of the latest

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,000
work that we've done here is to address

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,160
a very dramatic point in our cities so

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,680
look at this number 65% of insects are

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,240
at the risk of Extinction due to climate

126
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,600
change this is a global number of course

127
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,400
this means that entire ecosystems are at

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,360
the edge of collapse uh it could have

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,160
really catastrophic impacts on the on

130
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:04,039
our world and cities are the places

131
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,680
where the the ecosystem ecosystemic

132
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:10,840
balance is more at risk so looking at

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,800
ecosystems today in in cities is more

134
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,039
and more important and being able to

135
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,319
build and plan and use our cities in a

136
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,720
way that more biodiversity uh can exist

137
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,080
it's something that it's crucial to do

138
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,639
right now and that many universities

139
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,880
many practicing our studies today well

140
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,120
the question is how you actually assess

141
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,919
biodiversity in cities well it turns out

142
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,199
that for doing this you just need to

143
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,520
count count insects those little bugs

144
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,880
sometimes they're beautiful sometimes

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,800
they're terrifying but it's what really

146
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,639
uh is

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,240
um what is really what what what is

148
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,000
really making our cities diverse so how

149
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,199
can we do it in a automatic way and not

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,599
simply having a person counting insects

151
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,000
well of course um visual AI techniques

152
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:08,160
are helping here it turns out that it's

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,759
quite easy for a computer to detect the

154
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,560
presence of an insect in a

155
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,039
picture but it's not very easy to

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,560
understand exactly which insect it's in

157
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,840
the picture there was basically a gap in

158
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,160
the literature a gap in what's available

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,240
in technology so together with our team

160
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,800
we developed a computer uh library that

161
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,000
allows to detect and most importantly

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
catalog and classify several several

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
thousands of insect

164
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,440
species and this was the first step

165
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,120
because first you need to be able to do

166
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,080
it with a computer then you need to make

167
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,000
it feasible in real life so we're doing

168
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,400
a lot of research in developing very

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
small cameras that can be deployed and

170
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,800
uh can do all this processing and this

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,159
is not simply a computer science

172
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,840
exercise this includes electronic

173
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:02,240
engineering for example because you

174
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,960
don't want to have a stupid camera that

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
streams all these images to the cloud

176
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,039
and then you have all the computations

177
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,159
the cloud you want to minimize all the

178
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,520
streaming on the camera so the objective

179
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,639
here is to have the computations

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,599
directly on the chip on the camera and

181
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,120
for doing this you need of course to to

182
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,240
optimize all the

183
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,039
computation and this of course is good

184
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,240
for privacy preserving so that you take

185
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,080
an image you compute the number of

186
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,520
insects and then you delete the image

187
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,640
straight away without even storing

188
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,760
it and when you can do it on a on a chip

189
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,680
the third step they were investigating

190
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,240
is creating some Gardens we're working

191
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,360
with entomologists we're working with

192
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,360
arborologist that are are helping us to

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,120
select the right mix of species that

194
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,880
attract the insects that we want to

195
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,839
count so that we can build the small

196
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,680
garden deploy the small cameras leave

197
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,440
them there for uh a number of weeks or

198
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,720
months count the

199
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,160
biodiversity and then eventually move

200
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,079
these Gardians somewhere in the

201
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,279
somewhere else in the city this is very

202
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,680
important for example in case of

203
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,560
Redevelopment of the city we can assess

204
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,279
biodiversity before the the development

205
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,240
after the development and understand if

206
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,959
the the the project the plan was

207
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,399
actually affected so those are all good

208
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,880
examples of visual AI to New City

209
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,480
problems let me go to another big

210
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,320
chapter which is the the sensing Ai and

211
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,160
let start again from a very real problem

212
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,399
that we have in our cities so look at

213
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:45,880
this map this uh is a a map showing air

214
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,640
quality pollution in in a city it's

215
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,600
something invisible uh we know better we

216
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,240
know pretty much if the city overall is

217
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,120
polluted or not but if you look at the

218
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,720
real data you see something quite

219
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,480
interesting pollution really changes a

220
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:07,600
lot in space uh look at those two

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,680
numbers across simply two blocks so few

222
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,120
few hundred meter distance you have very

223
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,760
good air quality or very bad air quality

224
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,839
and this is normal it's because there

225
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,079
are different wind flows is because the

226
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,880
emitters of pollutants are located in

227
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,560
some specific zones and so even if we

228
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,880
know on average the air quality in the

229
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,360
city it's still very interesting to

230
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,320
understand locally what happens well how

231
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,399
do you do it uh you cannot do it with

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,200
fix sensors like on the left hand side

233
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,720
of the screen unless you really want to

234
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,519
deploy fixed sensor every meter in our

235
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,560
in our streets um you cannot really do

236
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,480
it with satellite pictures because

237
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,760
satellite pictures are not accurate

238
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,959
enough uh to to detect their quality in

239
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,120
our streets so what we've uh what we've

240
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,000
done is take advantage of something that

241
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,800
is already moving in our C in our cities

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,880
like

243
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,880
Vehicles we design some special sensors

244
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,600
and attach these sensors to Vehicles if

245
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,959
you take vehicles that are already in

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,399
the city and they already move a lot

247
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,480
like taxis like uh trash trucks like

248
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,399
like police

249
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,240
cars you basically create a network of

250
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,680
moving sensors in the city well this is

251
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,000
the result you're able to with very very

252
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,480
few sensors create these beautiful maps

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,920
that are able to show in this case air

254
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,800
quality in space and time in every point

255
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,120
in the city you show this to people and

256
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,480
you're basically making tangible

257
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
something

258
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,360
invisible making people understand

259
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,120
what's the air quality not in the in the

260
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,959
city but whether kids go to school or

261
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,560
where they live well this was the the

262
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,880
first use case but if you keep using

263
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,720
this methodology which is creating

264
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,800
sparse sensing with moving sens sensors

265
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,040
attached to Vehicles you can do many

266
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,440
other things those are some of the

267
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,160
Cities we've been studying and we've

268
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,160
been deploying our technology too uh

269
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,720
Cambridge was the first one 2017 a few

270
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,600
years ago we studied the air quality

271
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,279
there uh in New York in 2020 we were

272
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,519
interested in in quality but

273
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,920
specifically as a social justice with a

274
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,880
social justice point of view we were

275
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,399
interested in understanding how the the

276
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,839
underprivileged U populations were

277
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:35,279
disproportionate exposed to bad air

278
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,639
quality in Stockholm 2020 we were not

279
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,440
interested in air quality because they

280
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,680
the air quality there is very good but

281
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
we were interested in something

282
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,519
different which is heat uh it turns out

283
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,040
that over Sumer the heat doesn't

284
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,360
distribute uniformly in the city you you

285
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,480
have these kind of heat bubbles heat

286
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,480
islands and the population there is

287
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,279
simply not ready to cope with the heat

288
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,000
so understanding this hyperlocal heat

289
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,279
issues was very interesting from the

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
city and we use the same technology with

291
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,360
a different sensor instead of a air

292
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,600
quality sensor just with a thermal

293
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,440
camera we were able to create these kind

294
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,040
of maps and um and start a conversation

295
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,279
with the city and suggest possible

296
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,399
interventions last example I'm going to

297
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:25,000
show you on this is Rome uh

298
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:28,079
2023 where we had again a different

299
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,320
problem um they had a problem with cre

300
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,240
not on the presence of trees but on some

301
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,800
parasites they would attack trees it

302
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,839
turns out that many of the Centennial

303
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,120
pine trees in Rome are getting sick and

304
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,040
are eventually dying because of very of

305
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,040
a very small parasite that is attacking

306
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,160
them well we can use the same um

307
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,000
approach to detect these parasites with

308
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,560
a combination of visible images and

309
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,040
hyperspectral images it's simple simply

310
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,600
a different type of camera there we are

311
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,399
equipping our our sensor with we are

312
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,440
able to automatically detect Tre

313
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,920
automatically understand the Spector

314
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:15,680
signature of that image which is

315
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,800
basically a proxy of how well the tree

316
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,320
is performing

317
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,399
photosynthesis and do an early detection

318
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,920
of this parasite we're doing it with a

319
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,959
local partner the Italian Carabiner

320
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,199
which are the local Forest Corps and we

321
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,279
equipped some of our their cars with our

322
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,079
sensors and so they go around in their

323
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:39,120
normal operations and perform these

324
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:41,839
analysis let me go to a third um chapter

325
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,720
here a third methodology in uh and a

326
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,360
third approach in using AI for urban

327
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,120
science which which was we called The

328
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,880
Crowd AI so not relying on one single

329
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,920
sensor or a network of sensors that we

330
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,680
distribute in the city but really

331
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,720
relying on people going around and again

332
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,360
let me start from a issue that we have

333
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,560
in our cities uh we're talking about

334
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,079
bridges

335
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:13,079
55,000 more than 55,000 bridges in the

336
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:14,839
US are considered structurally deficient

337
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,160
uh this is a fact this number is from

338
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,360
the Department of Transport well I'm not

339
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,320
talking about this um every engineer

340
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,240
that is hearing this this webinar is is

341
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,600
familiar with this this was the Tacoma

342
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,639
Bridge back in the 40s this was a big

343
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,000
design fault fortunately we know how to

344
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,600
build Bridges

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,959
today you might be familiar with this

346
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,399
the Baltimore Bridge a few years ago

347
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,319
again this was a a problem in the bridge

348
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,639
with a catastrophic consequence but

349
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,240
fortunately not all deficient Bridge

350
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,199
collapsed uh this is a bridge in front

351
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,639
of MIT if you've been on campus the The

352
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,199
Long Fellow Bridge a few years ago they

353
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
had to close the bridge because they

354
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,440
found a crack uh of course the bridge

355
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,639
didn't collapse but it was not

356
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,040
considered to be safe um the problem is

357
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:06,240
that they had to close the bridge for

358
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,040
more than 5 years because they realized

359
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,959
that it was too late and the crack was

360
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,800
actually much bigger than uh than they

361
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,720
realized from a visual inspection so

362
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,800
they closed the bridge for five years

363
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,399
they fixed it but of course if you are

364
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,399
from the Cambridge area you still

365
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,759
remember the the negative impact on the

366
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,720
cities of of closing some such a big

367
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,600
bridge well well what's the problem the

368
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,399
problem is that bridge inspection is

369
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,040
very infrequent and low Tech basically

370
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,600
visual inspection so can we do something

371
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,920
better well we know that every bridge

372
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,319
vibrates uh this is totally normal every

373
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,639
engineer know this and studied this very

374
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:51,440
well and by monitoring this vibration we

375
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,519
can better understand the health of the

376
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,959
bridge we can know if the bridge is

377
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:01,759
structural sound or not so monitoring a

378
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:04,039
vibration is something um that uh that

379
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,199
can that can tell us a lot of things on

380
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,039
the bridge the problem is that it's very

381
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,600
expensive if you want to monitor a

382
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:13,319
bridge vibration you need to install

383
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,039
sensors like here in this image on the

384
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,079
beautiful Golden Gate Bridge in San

385
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,720
Francisco you need to send people

386
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:24,120
install the sensors power them transmit

387
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,199
the data and analyze them it's thousands

388
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,240
of dollars just for one Bridge so big

389
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,520
and important Bridges like the Golden

390
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,200
Gate we can afford it but definitely not

391
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,880
for every bridge in the US or in the

392
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,160
planet so our question and our approach

393
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,440
was can we do something different um are

394
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,039
there different sensors that can sense a

395
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,320
bridge vibration well if you think about

396
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,720
it in your pocket you have a smartphone

397
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,440
and in every smartphone there is an

398
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,120
accelerometer when you drive on a bridge

399
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,440
you're basically bringing an

400
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,320
accelerometer as you're driving on that

401
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,080
bridge and that accelerometer of course

402
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,960
it's taking the the cars vibration but

403
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,000
also the bridge vibration so the very

404
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,200
interesting question and a little bit

405
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,919
provocative was can we use normal

406
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,400
smartphones to measure a brage

407
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,440
vibration well we are at MIT we like

408
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,760
these kind of weird questions a little

409
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,960
bit provocative uh so we decided to go

410
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,280
and investigate it we equipped the car

411
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,400
with some smartphones different types

412
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,039
um a professional sensor like the one in

413
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,960
in Orange that you can see and then we

414
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,679
went on the Golden Gate Bridge uh

415
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,559
driving back and forth and back and

416
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,679
forth getting some data well that's one

417
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,280
of the beautiful things of having

418
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,799
students at MIT that are very happy to

419
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,559
do this because of the research so after

420
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,520
more than 100 back and forth of the

421
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:57,200
bridge we went back to the to the lab we

422
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,840
analyzed data and we discovered that uh

423
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,159
actually good news

424
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,280
cell phones record a lot of vibrations

425
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,320
and we can distinguish the car

426
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,320
vibrations with the bridge fundamental

427
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,520
vibration so we put in a big inter

428
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,760
interdisciplinary team of people and

429
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,720
eventually publish some some major

430
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,520
papers they show this technique of

431
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,200
understanding if a bridge is sound

432
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,360
simply using people's cell phones on

433
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,360
Bridges and then we started a

434
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,120
collaboration with a

435
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,880
with the Italian version of the dot the

436
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,880
Department of Transport we developed an

437
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,520
app we gave it to some to some people we

438
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,840
monitored Three Bridges different types

439
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,720
small and and bigs and the goal was

440
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,679
having something like this uh which is

441
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,440
not telling well the bridge is going to

442
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,159
collapse in two days no that's not our

443
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,120
our our objective the objective is

444
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,720
saying there is something that is not

445
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,360
behaving well in this part of the bridge

446
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,080
you should go and inspect it it's

447
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:05,440
basically a red light that uh that gives

448
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,919
an indication of you should take care

449
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,679
you should inspect more this part of the

450
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,600
bridge and uh and and send specialized

451
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,400
engineer and this is a beautiful

452
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,760
approach because you're really relying

453
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,679
on people to gather the data and with a

454
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,840
very lowcost approach to be able to do

455
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:29,559
early warnings predictive

456
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,240
maintenance and then number four is is

457
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,159
AI for the

458
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,840
informal because most of the science and

459
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,919
most of the urban

460
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,440
planning techniques that uh that we

461
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:44,840
study that Academia study that the

462
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,520
practice study are for the developed

463
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:51,120
word for the formal word well there is

464
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,280
another part of the word which is called

465
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,640
informal uh look at

466
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:02,360
this this is in Brazil HOSA one of the

467
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:06,120
favas those are places where there is no

468
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,600
formal rules for the city to grow and

469
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,039
when uh people basically decide

470
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,080
themselves The Grow of cities you see

471
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,799
something like this which is very

472
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:20,640
interesting from a natural grow point of

473
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:24,279
view but of course it can create many

474
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,679
problems this is the whole picture Ora

475
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,159
you see that it's climbing up on a

476
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,200
mountain and when I'm saying that it's

477
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,880
causing a lot of problems it's not only

478
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,240
because of Health for example um Oria is

479
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,120
one of the places in in the world with

480
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,760
the highest concentration of TB TB

481
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,559
tuberculosis simply because in this very

482
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,480
very narrow streets there's not enough

483
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,919
airf flow to make the the environment

484
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,919
safe and so many times they actually

485
00:21:52,919 --> 00:22:00,279
need to take down some of the houses

486
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:03,279
simply to enhance the air flow and uh

487
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:06,120
and reduce the number of TP cases but

488
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,320
she don't only have health issues you

489
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,000
also have environmental issues uh look

490
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
at this side of the mountains this is

491
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,200
really interesting because you might say

492
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,919
well what happened here why did the the

493
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,799
FAA grow on the left hand side but not

494
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,440
on the central part of the image well um

495
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,120
it turns out that yes the the favel

496
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,000
actually did grow on all parts of the

497
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:32,880
mountains but this part sided away there

498
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,840
was um there was a huge Landslide and

499
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,360
all these houses basically collapsed

500
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,640
with the population on it to the point

501
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,919
that today in in Rosia it's not

502
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,840
infrequent to

503
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:49,240
see those uh systems that are simply

504
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,480
there for announcing to the population

505
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,320
Whenever there is a big rain and a risk

506
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,320
of flood so that the population can at

507
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,200
least Escape so those are the phes the

508
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,760
the the issues that we are experiencing

509
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,279
this in these kind of towns but normal

510
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,080
urban planning techniques are not uh

511
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:13,720
ready to to cope with this um think

512
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,240
about Maps it's very hard to map this uh

513
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,720
these environments simply because a

514
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,320
normal satellite image is not uh enough

515
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,000
to understand the Topography of this

516
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,000
Urban environment that is developing on

517
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,880
the mountains there are no um addresses

518
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,600
of course Amazon doesn't deliver here

519
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,480
because there are no formal addresses

520
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,360
people don't have property titles to um

521
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,559
certifi that they live in that kind of

522
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:47,760
in in that house so our approach was can

523
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:51,320
can we generate new data for helping the

524
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,120
local community and scientists to

525
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,799
address this kind of problems so one of

526
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,919
the first things we we thought is

527
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,360
increase the mapping of these

528
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,120
environments of course you don't want to

529
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,520
to go there with with cameras you don't

530
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,520
go to you don't want to go there with

531
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,640
drones of course because people would

532
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,799
not accept that we would take pictures

533
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,679
of of people so we thought a lighter

534
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:19,919
lighter is a beautiful example of a uh

535
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,360
sensor that is able to create 3D maps of

536
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,200
the volumes but without mapping people's

537
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,080
faces without taking visible

538
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,960
images so together with some with some

539
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,240
local representatives of the community

540
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,279
and together with some MIT researchers

541
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,360
we went to Rosa in Brazil uh mapping the

542
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,200
the fabellas with lighters explaining to

543
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,399
the people why we're doing this and the

544
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,039
choice of this kind of technology and

545
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:49,039
this is the end result

546
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,679
he

547
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,760
so if you start from a good digital

548
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,320
representation of the environment you're

549
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,799
then able to model and to simulate much

550
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,039
better different phenomena for example

551
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:57,559
TB we are able to exactly understand how

552
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,640
the airf flow happens and what could be

553
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:03,159
surgical in interventions for increasing

554
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,399
airf flow for example another example

555
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:07,640
could be property titles we can start

556
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,960
thinking with the local community of

557
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,159
different types of proper property types

558
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,960
may maybe based based on blockchain or

559
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,640
on different approaches this is

560
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,760
something that should of course be done

561
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,120
with the local community but we see

562
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,919
these Technologies as something that

563
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,159
should Empower uh Innovation and um and

564
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,960
new decisions not from the point of view

565
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,840
of the researchers but to facilitate the

566
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,080
dial

567
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,559
and to basically explore what's possible

568
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,880
and how new digital Technologies can

569
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,640
help and solve some of these

570
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,440
issues well let me just tell you a last

571
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,760
project this is something that puts

572
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,600
together many of the techniques that I

573
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,120
discuss today and it's uh it's taking

574
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,919
place in in Amsterdam if you go to the

575
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,600
beautiful city of Amsterdam we were we

576
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,320
have a lab there and we engage with the

577
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,120
mayor and the mayor a few years ago uh

578
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,840
tked us to rethink and reimagine the

579
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,240
urban mobility in

580
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,120
Amsterdam and uh as everything is moving

581
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,559
towards Electric Mobility and autonomous

582
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,200
Mobility we thought why don't we

583
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,960
integrate Electric in autonomous

584
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,320
Mobility but in a very Amsterdam Way

585
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,799
because in Amsterdam you see more water

586
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:25,559
than asphalt you have more canals than

587
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:28,640
roads and so we thought of combining

588
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:31,600
boats and said driving cars in A New

589
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Concept which we called robot which is a

590
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,760
self-driving boat again it was a very

591
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,760
MIT approach uh move fast and break

592
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,720
things get your hands dirty we took it

593
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,080
literally so in in our lab we started to

594
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,640
assemble small boats equipping them with

595
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,640
some different

596
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,679
sensors then we started teaching these

597
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:59,799
small boats how to navigate in uh in

598
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,240
water what you see here is the mat

599
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:04,799
swimming pool where we were testing our

600
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,840
our boats to automatically follow a

601
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,440
trajectory or to automatically avoid

602
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,679
different uh different obstacles that

603
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,279
they might find on the on the way we

604
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,960
have to of course develop all the

605
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,240
algorithms for cell navigation and

606
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,760
multivessel coordination in order to

607
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,880
have different boats to interact with us

608
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,039
and of course this was a big work a huge

609
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,360
work done at Urban studies planning at

610
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,120
the computer science department with

611
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,880
several people

612
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,559
involved and after 5 years of research

613
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,480
we were able to create some new boats

614
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,159
which are functioning and today if you

615
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:48,279
go to Amsterdam you might jump on some

616
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:52,080
of these bolts which as you can see are

617
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:54,559
level five autonomy and are able to

618
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,039
carry around people in an autonomous way

619
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,200
it's interesting to see that reaching

620
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:00,320
level five autonomy on canals is

621
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,919
actually much easier than on the roads

622
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,080
because you have um slower speeds and

623
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,960
less

624
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,480
congestion the very interesting part is

625
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,080
that once you solve the technological

626
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:19,360
part which is having a boat that is able

627
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,840
to self navigate you can be creative in

628
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,200
ways to apply this technology because if

629
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,480
you don't see the boat as a boat but as

630
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,799
a floating pixel you're able to un to

631
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,919
create different use cases like like

632
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,320
this one this is same type of Technology

633
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,559
the same boat but for a different use

634
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,480
which could be trash collection we found

635
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,799
that it's in Amsterdam it's hard to

636
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,559
collect trash normal way and so we

637
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:49,480
thought it moving the trash collection

638
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:52,440
to the canals in this approach where you

639
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,120
have people throwing a trash in the boat

640
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,440
and then the boat whenever it's full It

641
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,039
autonomously Go and dump itself well

642
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,120
there are many things that you can do

643
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,399
today with this we've done the research

644
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,960
part now this research uh has P out in a

645
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,440
in a startup it's called robot. Tech

646
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,399
where they are uh doing the R&D to the

647
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,840
commercialization of this but there are

648
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,399
so many possibilities the possibilities

649
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,279
of creating new pieces of infrastructure

650
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:22,880
for example a Urban Street Market or

651
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,039
Urban Water Market having different

652
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,360
pixels floating pixels different boats

653
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,799
to latch together and uh and create new

654
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,159
spaces or solving some of the mobility

655
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:34,240
issues in Amsterdam like creating um

656
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,840
temporary Bridges whenever you need a

657
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,679
temporary Bridge you can have those diff

658
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,840
different vessels to coordinate and

659
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,760
create a new piece of infrastructure

660
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,039
well those are just some of the things

661
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,720
that we do uh I hope you you understood

662
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,320
a little bit how we can creatively use

663
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,919
technology for addressing different

664
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,480
Urban issues in different parts of the

665
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,559
world and uh and we're always very happy

666
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,639
to think of the next project and think

667
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,440
of the next new exploration of new

668
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:06,919
digital Technologies in different

669
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:11,000
environments thank you thank you ubo for

670
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:14,559
your excellent talk on exploring cities

671
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,639
through AI branding science and design

672
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:21,360
uh I do get a couple questions here uh

673
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:24,519
first one is that you uh your lab works

674
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,120
with many cities I remember every year

675
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,559
you publish a book about the joint the

676
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,159
research project with the city can you

677
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,919
see something about the about this kind

678
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,120
of

679
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,799
City collaboration project with cities

680
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,720
and how you select a city and and how

681
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,440
you work with

682
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,720
it definitely well there are many cities

683
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,399
that we are working today and that we

684
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,519
have worked in the past uh as I said

685
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,039
cities are great test beds for our

686
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:57,039
technology because they offer us a um

687
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,399
sandbox to really deployer technology

688
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,039
and get data

689
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,960
every year we teach a class uh at MIT

690
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:09,039
where we have MIT students to focus on a

691
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,399
specific Urban science technology and we

692
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,320
offer them the possibility to do real

693
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:16,399
projects in some of the cities and

694
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,360
that's why with our partner cities

695
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,320
we every every year we have this number

696
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,799
of students that not only focus their

697
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,960
work on those cities but also go and

698
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:31,880
visit those cities to really have a

699
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,559
360° uh experience of those Urban

700
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,159
problems in those cities and so every

701
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:40,360
year we do this with different cities

702
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:44,399
thank you and also next question here is

703
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,320
uh at one of your recent conferences you

704
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,080
have a

705
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,880
concept uh about

706
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,760
proximity and uh that's very impressive

707
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,840
because got this question can also

708
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,639
related to our next speaker research can

709
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,240
you see something about the proximity

710
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:04,960
concept well well definitely uh

711
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,880
proximity Is Something the the most

712
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,679
fundamental reason why we live in cities

713
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,120
we live in cities

714
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,919
because we we find positive to cross

715
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,000
path with people every day we find it

716
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:25,120
positive to exchange

717
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,960
ideas and experiences and chromosomes

718
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,679
with other cities living close to us so

719
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,919
it was very interesting for us in in

720
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,720
understanding what are the good aspects

721
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,760
of proximity and what are the bad

722
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,279
aspects of proximity uh when you have

723
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,039
too many people in a place you have

724
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,760
congestions you have traffic and you

725
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:46,679
have diseases um we tackled during covid

726
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,279
this question in terms of from from the

727
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,960
remote working point of view does it

728
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,919
still make sense to work in a in a

729
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,840
proximity way does it still make sense

730
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,960
to go to the office and meet colleagues

731
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,000
or not well um we had a great

732
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,159
opportunity during covid

733
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,040
to to analyze a very good data set

734
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,000
coming of course from from our house MIT

735
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,679
or people who were working before in a

736
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,480
normal way so in this in the office and

737
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,240
after so fully remote during covid and

738
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,760
understand the interactions among those

739
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,599
people well we discovered that people

740
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,200
that used to talk with themselves what

741
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,200
we call the uh strong ties

742
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,399
um kept doing their work exactly as they

743
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,520
would what we experience with remote

744
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,440
working fully remote working is what is

745
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,440
in in literature is called the this the

746
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,079
weak ties which are the new encounters

747
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,560
which are the the people that do not

748
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,679
normally talk to each other they may be

749
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,839
a cross path once a year or once every

750
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,040
few months but those connections are

751
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,760
very interesting and dramatically uh

752
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:00,040
useful for exchanging new ideas and for

753
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,880
bringing new Innovation for bringing New

754
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,480
U fresh ideas and fresh discussions in

755
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,720
our social network well it turns out

756
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,599
analizing data that uh only with remote

757
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,320
working you don't have the creation new

758
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,760
wi ties meaning that we always we we

759
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,720
keep talking to the same group of people

760
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,680
and the flow of ideas between different

761
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,599
groups is really really impaired so

762
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,960
those are some of the work that we have

763
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,320
been doing with proximity in the in

764
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,480
trying to understand and the million

765
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,440
dooll question is should we keep going

766
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,160
to the office or not and with which

767
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,280
balance thank you very much we do have

768
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,920
other questions but for the sake of the

769
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,920
time we'll probably leave these

770
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,920
questions for next time
