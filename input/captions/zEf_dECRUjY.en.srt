1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,480
okay so um should we

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,920
continue okay

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,880
so where are we so we we did a little

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,960
detour to Zer knowledge and we even

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,039
showed a zero knowledge proof now I know

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,240
I did it very very handwavy actually

7
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,559
didn't plan to really teach zero

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,320
knowledge even though it's hard not to

9
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,520
because it's so beautiful um but what I

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,480
did want to what the reason I'm pointing

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,320
out this I mean we will use it it's G we

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,239
will touch Z knowledge some more next

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,800
time

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,079
but this protocol is at least half sound

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,960
is half now let's see what happens if we

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,760
apply fimir to it and let's say we apply

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,519
even the random orical model featuring

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,640
the random orical model because

19
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,239
remember we started by asking the

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,439
it sound we don't know and then we said

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,159
you know what but if instead of actually

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,040
a hash function you use random Oracle

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,759
like a completely random function then

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,880
of course it should be sound because

25
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,479
what does it matter intuitively what

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,119
does it matter if the prover is talking

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,000
with a verifier or he's talking with the

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,920
hash function it's kind of so if it will

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,960
sound when he was talking to the

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
verifier the verifier sends him random

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,400
bits it should be tell when talk to the

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,439
hash F because the hash function also

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,399
send them random bit

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,840
almost almost true but but not why let's

35
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,799
look at this example I'm going to tell

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,640
you how I can easily cheat in the random

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,119
oral model okay so I have a g it's not

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,159
in the it's not in the language it does

39
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,079
not have a hamiltonian

40
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,799
cycle what I'm going to do I'm gonna

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,320
hope for the best what do I mean hope

42
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,840
for the best I'm gonna guess your B I

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,880
say you know what let me try to guess

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,039
what the what the B of the hash function

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,079
is going to be I don't know it's going

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,560
to be it's a random function let me

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,240
guess it's zero so because it's zero I

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,200
know I'm going to be asked to open on

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,680
the cycle so I'm going to commit to a

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,280
random

51
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,319
cycle this is some string Alpha I'm

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,000
going to go to my hash function give him

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,400
a x and Alpha my G and Alpha and I get

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,640
back a bit B if it's zero huh I open and

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,560
I'm happy if it's not zero I'll try

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,560
again again I'm going to choose a random

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,440
I can always choose zero or I can just

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,879
choose kind of a random uh bit if it's

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,879
one I'm going to you know I can commit

60
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,280
to all

61
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,560
zeros because anyway I just need to open

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,200
zeros I'll just commit to the all zeros

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,400
and then when you open I give you a pie

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:53,560
and I'll open the non-edges see Zero the

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:57,280
point is I can rerun you in the in in

66
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,440
the in in the actual protocol yeah with

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,560
probility half I win but I I can't like

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,120
I I can't tell you okay let's try oh

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,000
didn't work let me try again say no you

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,799
you failed you you don't get to try

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,440
again I know that if you try again again

72
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,680
eventually you'll win so you got one run

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,480
try with the random Oracle I have the

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,720
Oracle so I can abuse it so I can try

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,360
many many

76
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,120
times and that's how I

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,519
break okay so what did we

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,480
learn let's go back to the random oracal

79
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,959
modotto so first it's not

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,959
secure or not

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,319
sound if PV if the pro if the

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,640
protocol has non negligible

83
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,840
soundness if you

84
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,239
can cheat with probability non-

85
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,560
negligible you're going to try try try

86
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,959
until you it works and then you present

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,640
that as a

88
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,439
proof so that was Leo's question and the

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,920
answer is it's not

90
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,720
sound okay so then you

91
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,000
say

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,639
fine is it sound of the protocol has

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,639
negligible

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,280
soundness and the answer is

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:32,759
no okay so also not

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,759
sound if protocol has NE ible sound

97
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,320
is okay that seems a bit sad but let me

98
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,080
give you the counter example okay so

99
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,759
consider go let's go back to our

100
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,919
beautiful zero knowledge protocol here

101
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,919
and it has only sound is half that was

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,759
kind of the complaint right fine let me

103
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,960
make the sound is negligible even two

104
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,720
the minus Lambda for you okay how let's

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,199
repeat it eventually Le the times okay

106
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,560
so we have a

107
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,120
g I send you

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,600
commitment of a supposedly a random

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,560
cycle you send me a bit I open

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,160
accordingly but then you're like okay

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,759
okay wait I'm not convinced let's try

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,600
again fine I send you another commitment

113
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,000
you send me another random bit I

114
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,680
reveal then he say no no no not still

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
not happy let's do it again and we do it

116
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
land the

117
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:33,960
times now if all the time every single

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,560
time I'm accepted you're pretty

119
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,080
convinced now the probability that I can

120
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,440
cheat is one over two Lambda because

121
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,639
every time with probity have you catch

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:45,039
me if I did all them correctly so it's

123
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,960
very negligible it's exponentially small

124
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,800
now I want to argue I can cheat in the

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,840
random Oracle model how exactly the same

126
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,800
thing how do I cheat I first I do not

127
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,280
have alpha 1 beta 1 Gamma One Alpha 2

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Beta 2 gamma two alpha right okay Alpha

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,720
let's start I I'm the cheating

130
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,440
po I try I guess B1 is g to be zero

131
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,400
Alpha One no fine I work hard I get my

132
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,720
alpha 1 beta 1 Gamma One good now Alpha

133
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,599
two same thing I choose I guess beta two

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,160
but I keep the first transcript I don't

135
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,560
toss it away I keep the first transcript

136
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,759
and then I guess beta

137
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,759
two if I guess correctly good if I

138
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,000
didn't I'm going to redo now and after

139
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,080
count of number of times I'm going to

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,199
get the second transcript probably after

141
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,360
twice but whatever and then I always

142
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:41,440
keep the first kind of I don't

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:45,479
know as many transcripts I had and I

144
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:49,400
extended so I can convince you

145
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,479
yeah repetition ah very good very good

146
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,919
so the question is what about parallel

147
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,120
repetition okay yeah this this SP thing

148
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,440
is fine if you hash the entire previous

149
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,080
transfer

150
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,319
because you can just you can just get a

151
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,319
new commment until you're

152
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,720
happy yeah so let me let me emphasize

153
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,360
actually that's a very good it's a good

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,879
a good a good uh point that you're

155
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,639
making

156
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:25,879
note when we apply F meal I I'm applying

157
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,039
the hat and what I said is oh I do the

158
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,479
same exact attack I get one protocol I

159
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,919
get an like I get one transcript Le the

160
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,360
transcript I'm done note that every time

161
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,599
I hash everything from the beginning

162
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,120
like the hash is an alpha 1 beta 1 GMA

163
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,919
one alpha 2 Beta 2 but so what I'm fine

164
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,159
if I let's say I got the first you know

165
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,280
let's say three transcript worked out so

166
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:54,680
I have alpha 1 beta 1 Gamma One Alpha 2

167
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,000
and Alpha 3 now I'm in the fourth I

168
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,680
guess beta

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,759
four I choose Alpha 4 accordingly I have

170
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,560
from the beginning like the fash and I

171
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,479
hope to see my bet four my I see it I'm

172
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,080
happy I compute gam four and I continue

173
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,599
I don't see it I try Alpha 3 again with

174
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,840
I I don't ask my first two that I

175
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,960
already did successfully I every time

176
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,440
extend and the point is I can always

177
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,639
extend in conon overhead kind of thing

178
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,479
yeah

179
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,840
B so the run time no okay so the

180
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,039
question look how long it I'm bounded

181
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,039
cheating Pro

182
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:36,839
how long does it take me every

183
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,919
transcript I it takes me kind of um I I

184
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,159
I do Conant number an average I do

185
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,000
constant number of tries on average I do

186
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,880
two tries so it's actually quite

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,560
efficient I I can generate my

188
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,839
transcript quite fast because how do I

189
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,880
generate it again I have G I don't it

190
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,440
may not have it may have it may not I

191
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
don't it doesn't have a hon cycle I

192
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,880
don't even know if it has an hon cycle

193
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,079
neither do I care cuz I'm never going to

194
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:08,120
use it how what do I do I choose beta

195
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:11,360
one Rand I I guess beta one randomly

196
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,720
very efficiently I commit because if

197
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,160
it's zero I just commit to a random

198
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,600
cycle if it's one I commit to all zeros

199
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,040
that's very easy and then I apply the

200
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,720
hash with probity half I got the better

201
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,800
one that I chose and then I can very

202
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,120
easily compute my answer gamma one which

203
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,480
is just a trivial opening

204
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,920
and I only need to repeat it like it's

205
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,800
only better half so on the overall I won

206
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,800
need to repeat the same one too many

207
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
times

208
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,560
that's come from

209
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,240
also that is

210
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,399
where that's why that's why this is not

211
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,200
sound exactly that's so I have

212
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,040
negligible soundness but still it's not

213
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,040
sound

214
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,320
exactly okay so this is bad but that's

215
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,519
the only time when it's not sound that's

216
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,880
it like everything else is sound so that

217
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,200
goes to the question about parallel

218
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:15,000
petition so now let me actually give you

219
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,000
a the theorem uh let's see

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,760
so the theorem is

221
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,720
that the FI CH

222
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,440
Paradigm is

223
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,240
sound finally is

224
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,240
sound in the random Oracle model

225
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,959
if the underlying

226
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:16,720
protocol is uh first it has negligible

227
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,720
sound it it has negligible

228
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,200
soundness and constant

229
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,600
round okay so if it has negaal soundness

230
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,040
and it has Conant number of rounds then

231
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,839
it's

232
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,920
sound okay before I had I got NE sound

233
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
is by repeating getting many many many

234
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,600
rounds

235
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,200
yeah oh yeah yeah otherwise you can't

236
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,320
even apply if the public

237
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,639
coin yeah if if it's not public coin you

238
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,959
can't even like complete until it

239
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:03,720
doesn't hold uh so I'm always talking

240
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,399
about public coin

241
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,040
protocols okay but let me say this is

242
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,480
not a characterization this is not an if

243
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,240
and only if we do

244
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,000
have protocols with many rounds for

245
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,800
which this does the random Oracle model

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,040
does apply in particular gkr so gkr has

247
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,959
many rounds so can we reduce intraction

248
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,480
in gkr and the answer is yes we can even

249
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,320
though it has many many rounds and the

250
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:37,360
reason why we can do it is because it

251
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,360
also it sound also or more

252
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,360
generally if the

253
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,079
protocol if the underling

254
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,800
protocol has what's

255
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:57,959
called round by round soundness I'll

256
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,959
Define it later maybe not today

257
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,360
and

258
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,040
any such protocol has round by round

259
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,600
sounds but this is more General and gkr

260
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,079
has round by round sounds so this is

261
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,440
kind of in parenthesis because we're not

262
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:21,000
going to talk about it

263
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,920
today maybe we will we'll see okay but

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,920
let me first prove

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,040
this okay so why is it

266
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,040
uh do it

267
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:52,120
here okay so I want to so let's do the

268
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,880
proof so take a protocol a public coin

269
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,279
protocol with Conant number of BR that

270
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,800
has negligible soundness and I I'm going

271
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,519
to prove to you that it's secure in the

272
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,120
that it sound in the random or when I

273
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,600
apply fe2 me on the random oracal model

274
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,600
okay so uh fix

275
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
any

276
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,360
protocol let's call it

277
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,800
PV for you know let's begin let's assume

278
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,800
just for Simplicity of notation you'll

279
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,639
see how it extends that it's three

280
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,639
messages okay so

281
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,240
suppose uh

282
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:33,000
PV has three messages

283
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,000
and negligible

284
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,040
soundness we'll later see how to extend

285
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,199
it uh more more

286
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,199
rounds so PV let's say there's some X

287
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,079
the question is in the language or not

288
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,040
and you know they both have so before

289
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,079
the hatch there's like Alpha he gets

290
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,560
back random beta he gets me gamma and he

291
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,880
chooses if to accept or

292
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880
not okay now

293
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:11,000
Suppose there exists a poly time a

294
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:14,399
poze adversary P

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,519
star that cheats I want to argue that

296
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
that it means I can cheat in the

297
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:24,399
original interactive protocol so suppose

298
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:27,240
there's P star and X not an L such

299
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:33,759
that the

300
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:38,120
probability that P star with h and V

301
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,120
with h this is kind of the fure Mir I

302
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,880
guess it accepts with probability at

303
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,240
least let's say

304
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,000
epsilon I'm going to argue that then I

305
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,959
can cheat in the

306
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,600
original scheme with probability a

307
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,600
little less than Epsilon but not too

308
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,160
small okay so if there exist a cheating

309
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,759
prover that can cheat in the F version

310
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,360
but in the random Oracle model then I

311
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,720
can cheat I can use him to cheat in the

312
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,720
original

313
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:17,199
scheme okay so how so first note because

314
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,560
uh we're a neg probability this is large

315
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,160
okay so beta is public coin it's random

316
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,279
in I don't know let's call it K but K is

317
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,440
um it's like super logarithmic because

318
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,480
if the only poom many options and one of

319
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,399
them I can cheat so I'll I'll

320
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,720
I can this is not statistical sound it's

321
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,680
um it's uh sorry ah erase what I said

322
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,680
let me try again

323
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,440
so I can these protocols on one of them

324
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,839
I can cheat like for any Alpha I can

325
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,839
always find the beta for which I can

326
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,639
cheat otherwise if I can't cheat on any

327
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,560
beta there's not no point in doing

328
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,880
interaction to begin with I'll just give

329
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,160
you Alpha and fixed a fixed beta I'll

330
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,680
give you gamma and that's it so these

331
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,720
protocols there's always betas for which

332
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,079
I can cheat on and therefore because I

333
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,280
have negligable

334
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,280
soundness beta must come from a super

335
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,480
polinomial Universe if it's only

336
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,880
polinomial then I can play the same game

337
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,280
that I did before kind of hope to

338
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,959
succeed it's like a s

339
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,360
uh too bad in Hebrew we have a very good

340
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,400
saying for this like uh you know the

341
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,319
hope when you cheat with the hope of not

342
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,880
being caught there's a word for it but

343
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:34,840
yeah Americans are too they don't cheat

344
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,840
so they don't have words for this

345
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:43,320
what is that a word okay I'm not from

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,640
con as like confence oh I see lying to

347
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:52,080
someone exactly yeah exactly exactly uh

348
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:55,159
yeah okay so okay so suppose uh there

349
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,960
exists uh fake it till you make it

350
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:01,760
exactly totally uh okay so Suppose there

351
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,159
this a cheating prover okay now how does

352
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,120
he cheat let's see what this prover does

353
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:11,240
this prover gives you he this Pro

354
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,159
outputs so this prover outputs some

355
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,360
alpha beta and gamma that like a

356
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,320
transcript right and this

357
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,960
beta is Hash of X and

358
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Alpha that's how we cheats that's that's

359
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,000
a that's a valid transcript that's a

360
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,919
transcript that will such and such that

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,080
the original verif accepts right so the

362
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,200
in the the prover he just outputs this

363
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,280
and the verifier checks that beta is

364
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,240
indeed h of X and Alpha and this is a

365
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,600
valid

366
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,919
transcript okay now the cheating

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,840
prover he G he gives he sends Oracle

368
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:54,480
queries to his hash function now this

369
00:18:50,840 --> 00:19:00,720
Prov is bounded he's polom

370
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,720
bounded let's say he sends so suppose

371
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:09,919
that P

372
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,919
star sends I know Q

373
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,400
queries to the Oracle

374
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,919
Tage okay he's bounded so he runs in

375
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,360
poly time so what does he do he has

376
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,280
Oracle access he's he he trying to cheat

377
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:30,480
for an a now he can ask his Oracle okay

378
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,520
here's alpha 1 give me beta 1 here's

379
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,120
Alpha 2 give me beta 2 here he saids

380
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
that most Pally many queries because

381
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,960
he's poom bounded so there's some

382
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,400
polinomial

383
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:48,240
Q ques that he sends to H and let's

384
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,240
denote them by Alpha One after Alpha

385
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,159
Q okay now first thing not

386
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,440
that the

387
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:00,159
probability that he succeeds in Jing

388
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
alpab beta G said that Alpha is not one

389
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,360
of the

390
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,360
queries is

391
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,640
negligible if he didn't ask how does he

392
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,200
he doesn't know what beta is the only

393
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,760
way he gives beta which is the right H

394
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,799
is by asking he has no idea what beta is

395
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,480
and so if he didn't ask he can guess his

396
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,000
probability like one like one over two

397
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,200
to the

398
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,760
K okay

399
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:29,679
so let me maybe I'll go here continue

400
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
here so first thing note

401
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,480
the

402
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,280
probability that he that Alpha Beta

403
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,360
gamma are

404
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,679
accepting with

405
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:50,320
X so meaning the verifier accepts them

406
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:55,039
and Alpha is not Alpha One up to it's

407
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,039
not one of them this probability is

408
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,080
negligible and this is because k k in

409
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,080
this is or it's yeah it's like something

410
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,039
like 1 over two to the

411
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,720
K

412
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:11,840
what ah sorry Alpha q and sorry what did

413
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,840
you

414
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:21,480
say oh no Alpha Al sorry oh X Alpha yeah

415
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,320
right but Alpha needs to be one of the

416
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:29,159
alpha ones sorry yeah so he sends okay

417
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:33,120
he sends kind of X comma alpha 1 up to X

418
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:36,279
Alpha K that's kind of what he sends um

419
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,400
I mean he can send other ones but then

420
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:41,279
uh yeah it shouldn't help him so okay it

421
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,799
should be one of the queries he yes

422
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,640
first of all because if he didn't ask

423
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,480
that he has no idea what the beta is so

424
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,960
he guesses the beta correct do one over

425
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,760
two to the K that's negligible okay so

426
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,039
this means that if he succees with

427
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,640
probability Epson that's not negligible

428
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,200
almost with this probability or

429
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,559
probability Epson minus negligible

430
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,400
he doesn't only succeed but he succeeds

431
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,400
with Alpha that he

432
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,720
queried so now I'm GNA use him because I

433
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,960
know that he succeeds with Alpha that he

434
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,240
queried I'm going to use him to cheat in

435
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,159
the interactive

436
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,400
protocol okay again I'm really abusing

437
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,320
not I'm really abusing the random Oracle

438
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,039
model because I'm kind of I'm assuming

439
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,120
that the verifier really the only way he

440
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,360
interacts with the oracle is by kind of

441
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,440
queries and I know the queries and I you

442
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,000
know and I can use it to kind of

443
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,679
cheat so let me now construct pble

444
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,080
star that

445
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,080
cheats in the

446
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,000
interactive in the interactive

447
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,760
protocol okay how do I cheat in the in

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,760
the interactive protocol

449
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,840
a okay so first I'm going to give you

450
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,200
with I'm going to give the same x with

451
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,640
x the same X so this PD star succeeded

452
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,559
with some X and the language I'll use

453
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,760
the same X now first thing I need so

454
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,320
here here I am p double star I'm ready

455
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,400
to go here's x v I need to start sending

456
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Alpha what do I do which Alpha do I

457
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,600
send now what do I know

458
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,440
I know I want to use this guy I can't

459
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,000
cheat I I'm going to use him he's a

460
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,200
cheater I'm going to use him what do I

461
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,720
know about him I know he cheated with

462
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,120
alpha beta and gamma and one of these

463
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,200
Alphas he used as a

464
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,440
query okay which one I don't know but

465
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,159
here's what I'm going to do I'm going to

466
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,919
guess

467
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:59,840
randomly and uh what's the thinging

468
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:02,760
again you fake it so you make it

469
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,919
I'm going to guess randomly in Hope okay

470
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,760
so what I'm going to do I'm going to

471
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,520
guess so what does p star

472
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,520
do first I'm going to

473
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:20,120
guess a random I in Q so just the index

474
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:22,520
which so I know he's going to make Q

475
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,960
queries I don't know yet which queries

476
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,840
but let's say I have a bound on his

477
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,919
runtime so I have a bound so p p star P

478
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,880
yeah P star are there runs in time at

479
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,799
most Q let's say so he queries at most

480
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,039
he makes it most C queries to the Oracle

481
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,320
that I know I'm going to choose a random

482
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:44,600
index like supposedly a random query of

483
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,120
one of the I query to his

484
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,760
Oracle and I'm I what I'm going to do

485
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,559
I'm going to send here Alpha now what is

486
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,320
Alpha ey I don't know what Alpha is but

487
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,679
don't worry what I'm going to do I am

488
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,919
going to simulate the Oracle from him so

489
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm going to pretend I'm the random

490
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,880
Oracle okay I'm going to start by saying

491
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,399
okay P I'm going to use you yeah let's

492
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,559
start you gave me X send me

493
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:12,720
Alpha like generate this generate alphab

494
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,799
GMA now what does p do when he generate

495
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,640
he's like okay let me think Alpha One

496
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:21,720
I'll give him a random beta one okay

497
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,679
Alpha 2 or X Alpha 2 I'm G give a random

498
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,720
beta two alpha 3 random Alpha Four

499
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:31,919
random until Alpha I once I get Alpha

500
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,320
I'm happy I'm like ha Alpha I I'm ready

501
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,399
Alpha

502
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,440
I I get a random beta

503
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:43,200
back what do I

504
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,760
do I tell him oh your answer from the

505
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
Oracle is

506
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,640
beta okay so I'm simulating P Stars

507
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,159
Oracle in my and and like I'm I'm

508
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,640
behaving like I'm the Oracle sitting on

509
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,279
top of P star Okay g Alpha One I'm sure

510
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,000
here's a beta one that's your answer

511
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,240
Alpha two beta two alpha 3 Bet Alpha I

512
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,760
for random I it's beta

513
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,960
now he gives me gamma now okay now he

514
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,760
gives answer and I continue alpha alpha

515
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,240
plus one random let do random random

516
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,200
random random

517
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,480
okay and then he gives me a

518
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,559
transcript but with probity one over Q

519
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:31,000
it's with my Alpha ey if you use with my

520
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,000
Alpha eye hooray I'm going to give the

521
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:40,159
GMA if it's my

522
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,559
Al I'm gonna you know fa well GNA try

523
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,240
again I mean then I

524
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,559
fail so what is the probability so

525
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,600
that's that's my protocol so if if he

526
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:51,320
didn't cheat with a gamma ey with the

527
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,559
with the alpha eye if this Alpha is not

528
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,640
Alpha ey I'm going to you know lose and

529
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,240
say sorry I

530
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
failed what is the

531
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,799
probability so so guess and then

532
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,360
simulate the

533
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,159
Oracle for p

534
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,159
star

535
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,480
randomly

536
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,960
except for Alpha I

537
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:38,559
I use the I simulate via the verifier

538
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,559
for Alpha I answer with

539
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,640
beta that's all and then

540
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:52,320
if Alpha Beta

541
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:55,679
gamma is such that Alpha equals Alpha I

542
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,640
then a you know

543
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,640
then I guess let's call this G then

544
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,519
send

545
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,720
GMA that's that's the protocol that's

546
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:12,320
the that's the cheating prover that's

547
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,320
pble star now what is the

548
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,039
probability that pble star is

549
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,000
accepted again what does pble star do p

550
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,399
star is acceptable with probability

551
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,320
Epsilon so with probability Epsilon he

552
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:30,320
gives me alphab the

553
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:37,559
gamma but he chooses

554
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Alpha after quering he chooses this

555
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:43,840
after quing the Oracle Q

556
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,440
times with different Alphas let's say

557
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,279
with all them he uses the same X

558
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,480
otherwise he's stupid uh but whatever it

559
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:53,159
doesn't really

560
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,600
matter we established that except NE

561
00:28:53,159 --> 00:29:00,039
probability one of these

562
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,039
Alpha is in the I query

563
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,240
so what is the probability that I

564
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:10,320
succeed very nice so the probability

565
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,799
great so the probability I'm out of

566
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,399
space so the

567
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:19,799
probability that p double star is

568
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,919
accepted is at least the probability

569
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:25,720
that P star is accepted over Q if he's

570
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,799
accepted if he chose alpi correctly but

571
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,399
it's random one of them he cheated with

572
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,480
I it randomly so probably at least one

573
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:34,880
over q i and minus the negligible which

574
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,200
is kind of Min is I guess one over two

575
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,200
to the

576
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:43,320
K which is kind of the probability that

577
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,559
he didn't even guess just the the alpha

578
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,559
is kind of he just didn't use one of the

579
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,799
queries but that's really small so it's

580
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,840
still pretty big I mean so there is a

581
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,840
loss there is a loss of

582
00:29:55,399 --> 00:30:00,640
q but but Q is polinomial and if Alpha

583
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,519
is non- negligible then Alpha over Q is

584
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,519
also non- negligible and that's a

585
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,760
contradiction any

586
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:18,240
questions yeah so the actually use like

587
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,200
the random model like where we couldn't

588
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,840
have just put in another half fun it's

589
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,080
like that Top Line there it's it's uh

590
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,600
it's not just it's it's not yes it's

591
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,840
this Top Line there but also

592
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,679
that we the fact that we even have Alpha

593
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:40,159
One up the fact that we can say that

594
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:41,880
there exists alpha 1 up up to Q like the

595
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,519
fact that we're able to

596
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,200
observe what he knows about the hash is

597
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,600
is in the random Oracle

598
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,880
model so the poofs on the random Oracle

599
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,720
model it's really means you know one

600
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,919
need to be careful because people want

601
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:03,320
to okay what's the kind kind

602
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,120
of so okay the Intuition or the the

603
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,039
intuition behind the roral model is to

604
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,360
say let's TR what do we need from the

605
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,440
hash function we want it to kind of look

606
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,960
random we want it to look random like

607
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,600
because the verifiers message are random

608
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,440
we want also to look random and now okay

609
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,480
because we look for and now and that was

610
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,440
kind of the motivation for theorical

611
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,880
model and then it's tempting to say so

612
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,360
now all we need is a hash function that

613
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,960
kind of behaves Rand randomly let's try

614
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,360
to use I know like people say like

615
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,679
pseudo random functions which we're not

616
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,559
defined here

617
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,519
whatever okay but you can but who knows

618
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,840
what

619
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,960
the how will you prove

620
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,279
soundness this proof unless really the

621
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,840
PO what it does is really just runs the

622
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,200
function if all he does if the cheating

623
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,240
po all he does he gets the function he's

624
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,600
like H this really looks like I don't

625
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
know what to do I'll just feed him

626
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,440
inputs see what output I get that's the

627
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,240
only thing I can do

628
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,919
then I can this proof in the random

629
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,840
Oracle model Mak sense but as long as it

630
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,799
can do anything else besides like

631
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,519
blindly feed an input get an output I

632
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,519
don't have a

633
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,519
proof

634
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,480
yeah oh one over two to the K yeah the

635
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,279
only reason I added this negligible

636
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,760
fraction here is there's one over two to

637
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:26,519
the K probability which is Tiny that P

638
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,480
star is accepted with none of the alphas

639
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,880
so maybe it just chose alp that was not

640
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,799
queried at all but you know he managed

641
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,200
to choose better randomly which happens

642
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:39,159
prob one over two to the K because he

643
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,120
does beta should be H and if he didn't

644
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:43,360
ask H then he doesn't know what beta is

645
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,279
and beta is random but there is that

646
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,080
probability that he chooses Alpha that's

647
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,080
not one of the Q so here if he chooses

648
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,960
one of the Q I guess the one he chooses

649
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,960
correctly with probability one over Q so

650
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,480
I get Epsilon over

651
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,679
q but if I I guess I should put here

652
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,320
yeah

653
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:09,120
uh yeah but if he chooses uh randomly

654
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,919
then like I'm I'm out of luck

655
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,919
yeah Q good I how how do I know Q very

656
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:19,559
good question I actually don't know Q

657
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,880
and The Q can the Q even can be a little

658
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,840
bit adaptive so maybe this cheating

659
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,000
prover he gets he sends Alpha One and

660
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,200
depending on beta one that he gets he

661
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,600
decides how many queries he wants to

662
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,960
maybe he's very happy with his better

663
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,240
one and he's done and maybe he's very

664
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,799
unhappy and sends another so it the

665
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,320
number of Q can be adapted

666
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:47,440
but since P star is fixed and I know his

667
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,519
polinomial time so let's say the runtime

668
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,159
of p is Lambda squar Lambda to the thir

669
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,399
I know that he cannot ask more than L

670
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,320
that to the third queries because each

671
00:33:53,399 --> 00:34:00,720
query takes one unit time to

672
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:03,200
ask so I can I can upper bound the

673
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,159
number of queries by the

674
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,000
runtime of P star so

675
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,560
really the probability that is

676
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,079
accepted if if I if I have no idea what

677
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,040
Q is and in the worst case it's the

678
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:16,599
runtime it's kind of ABS on over the

679
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,000
runtime of P

680
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:22,800
star which that I know because I'm

681
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,800
giving P star let's say is an as a

682
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:32,240
circuit that like do

683
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:36,320
Hal no no I'm I I'm promised that P

684
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,000
Stars pomal size I know it halts so my

685
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,839
contradiction assumption is as

686
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,839
follows Suppose there exist a poly size

687
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:48,119
poly size I don't know Lambda to the

688
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:50,879
third size P star now I know that Lambda

689
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:54,040
to the third asks most Lambda sorry that

690
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:57,040
P star asks at most L to the third

691
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,040
queries

692
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,160
I I I think of the circuit of P of P

693
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,920
Star as being a circuit that has kind of

694
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,800
H Gates like random Oracle Gates so you

695
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,400
can feed it like alpha or X and Alpha

696
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,640
and out comes and it's like one gate

697
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,720
it's like one time

698
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,720
unit uh but he cannot have more than

699
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,480
Lambda to the third of them because

700
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,480
that's the size of the circuit

701
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,520
Loops no it doesn't no no no it doesn't

702
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,839
have loops it's like it's yeah no I

703
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,480
mean it can have it there the runtime is

704
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:43,000
fixed like it can compute at most at

705
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,320
most Lambda to the third Gates it has

706
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,320
Lambda to the third gates in

707
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,839
it so any any other questions

708
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,599
okay uh this was three

709
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:09,920
rounds uh what about

710
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:13,440
more so what if you have like

711
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,760
a I don't know a c

712
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,520
rounds what happens then any any guess

713
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,079
in

714
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,960
how the probability decays with the

715
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,960
number of

716
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,960
rounds

717
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,920
yeah exactly yeah exactly so it's going

718
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,560
to be if if you have C rounds or C

719
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,240
messages from the verifier let's say if

720
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,359
you have C messages from the F it's GNA

721
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,839
be something

722
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:44,359
like Epson over Q to the C and to see

723
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:48,079
why it's just uh it's really the same

724
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:51,040
argument what we need to do is suppose

725
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,599
that in each

726
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:59,599
round p star send the most Q queries so

727
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:02,720
maybe he sends a q Q ques of the form

728
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,040
alpha 1 like XC alpha 1 and then he

729
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,760
sends Q ques of the form X alpha 1 bet

730
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,000
like X Alpha Beta and then he sends

731
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:16,000
sorry X Alpha Beta gamma and then he

732
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,440
sends qqu of the form X alha so Q quer

733
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,119
for each partial transcript he has Q

734
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:27,680
queries now if you have C rounds you

735
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:30,680
need to guess correctly for each partial

736
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,560
transcript the correct I I'm going to

737
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,440
guess that so I'm not going to write it

738
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,720
down but like because it's really the

739
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:41,119
same but let me just say it in words

740
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:45,800
pble star what he does is for every

741
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:50,160
round of the verifier he guesses the

742
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:55,160
index of the query of he guessed the

743
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,960
index of the kind of the hash the query

744
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,920
to the hash function which is going to

745
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,400
be used in the

746
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,480
proof okay so he's going to guess and

747
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,319
here we said you guess I now we're

748
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,680
actually going to

749
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,680
guess i1 up to I

750
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:17,960
C okay for each message of the verifier

751
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,560
we're going to guess an index and now we

752
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,720
again just emulate p p star exactly as

753
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:28,160
before so how do I emulate I go to P

754
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,400
star he asks me just Alpha One like if

755
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,480
he ask me just of the form for the first

756
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,800
message like alpha 1 Alpha 2 Alpha 3 I

757
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:41,440
give him random random random random

758
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:43,520
random until he asks for beta for for

759
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,079
Alpha I and then I give beta

760
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,599
I now in between in between he may ask

761
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,000
for bigger he may ask all of a sudden

762
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,000
for X comma Alpha Beta

763
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,920
GMA random then random I give everything

764
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,319
random

765
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,800
but the first point I get Alpha the I

766
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:06,880
query for like the first corresponding

767
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,880
to the like transcript like the first

768
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,680
message then I'm like aha I got it Alpha

769
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,400
I thank you very much I put my Alpha I I

770
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:19,920
get beta I answer beta as the as kind of

771
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,200
the answer from the Oracle and now I'm

772
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,319
happy now I start

773
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,079
counting how like for I to I start

774
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:28,119
counting how many messages are are the

775
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,640
four

776
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,160
Alpha Beta and some gamma Alpha Beta

777
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,960
Gamma 1 Alpha Beta gamma 2 Alpha Beta

778
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,200
until I get I2 all of them answer

779
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,079
randomly once I get and any other

780
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,640
queries for that I don't know what from

781
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:48,800
random once I get to the I to like Alpha

782
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,400
Beta like Alpha Beta gamma I2 like the

783
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,079
I2 I'm happy I run here I put my gamma I

784
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,440
get a Delta I answer with Delta now I

785
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,200
start counting how many qu of the like

786
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,880
qu of the form Alpha Beta Gamma Delta

787
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:09,280
Epsilon sorry Epsilon is fixed next one

788
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,200
I can't until I get I3 I3 and the i3d of

789
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,040
them I give the

790
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,599
answer I just do it for as many rounds

791
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,359
as needed but for me to be Sol I need to

792
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,280
make all these guesses correctly and

793
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,280
each guess is going to be probable to Q

794
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,440
so that's why kind of the probability

795
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,960
decays a lot

796
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,040
yeah does that mean that number of round

797
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,400
is like L security parameters you still

798
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,079
secure yeah good good good no it's not

799
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,440
okay if the number is log it's almost

800
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,200
secure but then the probability is Q to

801
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,520
the log it's not two two Q is not two so

802
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,560
you'll get a little negligible however

803
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,880
so it will be negligible but not too too

804
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:58,240
negligible it's it's going to be kind of

805
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,560
Quasi poly like one over quasi poly so

806
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,839
if you have log

807
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,319
grounds if you know if you happen to

808
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,640
know that the original interactive

809
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,640
protocol has soundness less than

810
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,680
quasi like subexponential let's say you

811
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,920
have the guarantee that a cheating po

812
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,400
cannot cheat except with like one over

813
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,240
subexponential

814
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,720
probability then log rounds will be good

815
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,839
so the number the number round C this is

816
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,400
this is really your your

817
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,920
um your probability of cheating and as

818
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,280
long as

819
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,720
your interactive protocol has the

820
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,800
guarantee that you cannot cheat with

821
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:44,200
this probability then then you have a

822
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,200
proof yeah yeah

823
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,920
replace good good good yeah so um so the

824
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,240
question was can we maybe replace this

825
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,280
but by Q over C to the power of C

826
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,160
because Q is the total number of

827
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,560
queries the thing is so

828
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,599
it's okay I'm not I'll tell you the

829
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,839
the it's not that simple because we

830
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,319
don't know exactly how many so suppose

831
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,880
the prover total asks Q queries we don't

832
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,160
know how many queries he has maybe he

833
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,200
has all of them on the first message and

834
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,240
then just one may and it can be adaptive

835
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,359
it can depend on his answers maybe he

836
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,480
asks Alpha One he gets with to one he's

837
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:31,640
happy he's not gonna ask again and all

838
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,359
the answers GNA be in the second

839
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,040
messages or maybe he asks he says he

840
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,240
sees he sends alpha 1 beta one he's so

841
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,119
unhappy all the Q goes for the first

842
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,839
message so how do you choose the

843
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:50,319
I like how do you choose for me like I

844
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,920
said let's choose them

845
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,720
randomly but you may be able to do

846
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,599
better I didn't you know one can think

847
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,520
can you do better than this possibly a

848
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,920
because you're saying don't forget about

849
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,359
the end end end like the end it's not

850
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,559
gonna most of them you won't go all the

851
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,440
way to the end because so you can

852
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,760
probably choose it more from the

853
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,520
beginning probably you can improve on

854
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,880
this uh I didn't do the calculations

855
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,480
because usually we don't really care

856
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,000
about constants you know uh but you're

857
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,000
saying

858
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,520
oh that's why it's not true in general

859
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,680
like in general you can but I you

860
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,520
probably will can improve it a little

861
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:38,640
bit you know what I mean uh

862
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,920
because yeah maybe you want to choose it

863
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,400
in different distribution not

864
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,720
randomly more more towards the beginning

865
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,480
because most of them are not going to be

866
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,400
at the end but uh yeah there probably

867
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,640
optimization that can be done great

868
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,640
great

869
00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:02,359
questions any any other question

870
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,880
okay so H let's see so maybe I will do

871
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:07,400
then I'm debating if to go to the

872
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,800
soundness in the standard model or to do

873
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,160
the round by round you know what I'll do

874
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,240
the round by round soundness because I

875
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,000
wanna so this says

876
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,559
kill oh good yeah thank you uh this okay

877
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,240
good so what did we thank you what did

878
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:26,720
we prove we proved that the random morle

879
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,559
model is sound the applied to the random

880
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,040
Oracle

881
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:34,680
is sound if you have constant number of

882
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:36,720
rounds and negligible air now K and

883
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,200
mikali protocol has constant number of

884
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,359
rounds four to be precise and negligible

885
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,119
error if you have you take the PCP with

886
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,599
negligible air which you can by we have

887
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,920
pcps with neg air you put it in and you

888
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,319
have four round negligible air you apply

889
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,960
in the random Oracle model it's

890
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:58,400
sound

891
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,720
so is sound in the random orical model

892
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,119
for kilan

893
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,839
M that's

894
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:09,880
great as I said we don't have a so now

895
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,079
you can ask do we have a proof of f

896
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,559
chamir for K mikali in the standard

897
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,079
model OKAY random Oracle model we have

898
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,559
how about standard

899
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:23,440
model and it's this is important because

900
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,839
for a long time people believed that if

901
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,599
we have a proof in the random Oracle

902
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,040
model it means there must be some hash

903
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,760
function for which this protocol is

904
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,880
sounded namely the belief

905
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,359
was if you have a proof in the random

906
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,839
orical model and then if you use it with

907
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:45,400
f something goes wrong like someone

908
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:47,599
breaks it we need to blame the hash

909
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,640
function ex you've used a bad hash

910
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,480
function for f meal okay so typically

911
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,640
you know when f is used in practice it's

912
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,119
used let's say with SH 256 that kind of

913
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,359
a standard offthe shelf hash function

914
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,559
that's used and now if someone ever

915
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:05,160
breaks your hash fun your

916
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:07,240
protocol the conclusion was shot 256 is

917
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,480
not a good hash function use another

918
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,760
hash

919
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,800
function okay

920
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,520
however this protocol is an example of a

921
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,040
protocol it's very natural you know it's

922
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,800
great like it's uh it was invented not

923
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,280
as a counter example for

924
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,559
f yet and it's secured the random oral

925
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,079
model

926
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:34,520
so f is securing the random orac for

927
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,720
this protocol yet there there are hash

928
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,040
functions

929
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,160
contrived but there are contrived hash

930
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:45,079
function such that this protocol is

931
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:48,200
insecure no matter which act in the it's

932
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,680
not secur in the F for any explicit hash

933
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,400
function that you

934
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,640
use it's secure in the anal model but is

935
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,640
not secure with any actual function

936
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,640
family

937
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,440
so what we learned from this is the

938
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,319
renom oral model is a night sanity

939
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,640
check but it's really not a proof I mean

940
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:10,800
we knew it's not a proof but it doesn't

941
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,200
even guarantee it doesn't guarantee that

942
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,800
there exists a

943
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:21,599
proof it's just a minimal San sanity

944
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:25,160
check yet let me tell you in

945
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,400
practice actually that's how people

946
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,119
check that things are secure in the

947
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,720
random work model if it verifies this

948
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:34,559
check they use it and as far as I know

949
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,960
things never broke because of of the

950
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:41,400
random oracal model being insecure so

951
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:44,680
it's more of a theoretical kind of

952
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:48,640
uh interesting thing but actually in

953
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,640
practice it's not an issue

954
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:58,559
yeah yeah so you know okay the question

955
00:47:52,920 --> 00:48:01,480
is anybody trying to break the answer is

956
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,480
you know okay things are broken all the

957
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,839
time okay things are hacked and broken

958
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,520
all the time it's very rare that what's

959
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:10,720
broken is actually the

960
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,680
crypto okay it's not the crypto that's

961
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,280
broken it's but people do try to break

962
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,119
for example one thing that often people

963
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,839
break they use to break is our

964
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:24,079
cryptography uses Randomness we use

965
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:26,599
Randomness in in our crypto and in

966
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,000
practice people don't use like are we

967
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:30,440
use secret Keys we assume our secret

968
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,800
keys are random but in practice where do

969
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:36,319
you get this Randomness and often the

970
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,760
implementations are not done well and

971
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,640
somehow guess what things are turned out

972
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,240
not to be random or not random enough

973
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,319
and and then things are attacked so

974
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,599
things are attacked a lot actually in

975
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:50,079
practice there's a lot of breaches

976
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:52,960
security breaches but

977
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,520
it's very rare that it's in the crypto

978
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,040
itself now why why is it not that on the

979
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,599
crypto

980
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,799
one would believe that just because the

981
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,200
crypto is actually

982
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:04,640
secure and you know it's implementation

983
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,799
that are the problem and how many people

984
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,760
are trying to attack the crypto it's

985
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:10,680
very hard to say but my guess is that it

986
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,319
h say there's a lot of people who are

987
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,559
working really hard to attack the crypto

988
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:17,160
but I'm not you know these are done

989
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:22,200
behind sealed door so

990
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:24,760
a I remember the there's a a fantastic

991
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,079
guy chafi go student in our community

992
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:31,760
called his name is Joe Killian and he

993
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:35,000
was a a professor and he moved to NSA

994
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,960
and I remember once I asked him after a

995
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,359
long time after he was already at NSA I

996
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,319
asked him so you know do you guys know

997
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,160
how to

998
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:48,720
factor and he told me his answer was you

999
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,079
know the worst part about my job I'm not

1000
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,440
allowed even to joke about these

1001
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:58,599
things so you know so the answer is we

1002
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,599
don't know

1003
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:05,280
yeah

1004
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:07,599
exactly okay any any other questions uh

1005
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,839
yeah like this just kind of General but

1006
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,200
like in general do you think like like

1007
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:17,359
private like the NSA like private like

1008
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,359
cryptography I guess like further

1009
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:24,240
than the question was do I have a guess

1010
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,599
so I I do not know the so let me let me

1011
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,680
phrase your question is do I have a

1012
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,799
guess as to if uh the NSA knows more

1013
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,079
than we do my guess would be yes because

1014
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:38,319
um they know everything we know because

1015
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:40,960
we don't hide anything

1016
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,640
and and they have smart people so why

1017
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,119
won't they know a little more you

1018
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,799
know do they know how to factor that I

1019
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:51,000
don't know like do they have like is

1020
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:53,440
their world hugely different than ours

1021
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,319
that I I don't know but I'm sure they

1022
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,079
probably have better something better uh

1023
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,920
than we we know than we do and we've

1024
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,440
seen it in history like I think even RSA

1025
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,920
was invented but actually was privately

1026
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,240
known before so we know examples so why

1027
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:14,000
probably today too but it is kind of I

1028
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,000
wish I you know be nice to know uh yeah

1029
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,079
people

1030
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:27,200
to that that's another thing no people

1031
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:29,119
don't tend to publish their failures so

1032
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,160
it's very hard to know going back to

1033
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,720
your question how much did people you

1034
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:37,000
know when we say look there's no break

1035
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:39,559
okay what does that mean are there no

1036
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,599
how it means we don't know of a break it

1037
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:42,680
doesn't mean there's no break we don't

1038
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,720
know of a break okay how much did we as

1039
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,520
the community try to break it's very

1040
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,400
hard to know because uh like exactly

1041
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,160
your question was very good one people

1042
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,920
don't say that don't report how many

1043
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,200
hours they tried to break and

1044
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,839
fail so

1045
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,799
um so we don't know yeah yeah if you do

1046
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:03,160
break something are you not supposed to

1047
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:05,880
like publish it like tell privately and

1048
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,160
then like wait like six months and

1049
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,119
then oh you're saying if you if you do

1050
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,799
break maybe you you need to be careful

1051
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:16,440
to publish it yeah I yeah uh maybe

1052
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:18,920
people break something all the time no

1053
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,960
one

1054
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,319
no I actually yeah I I actually don't I

1055
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:28,000
know so I don't you know my my job I

1056
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:30,920
don't uh that's not art I kind of do I

1057
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,240
don't usually break schemes I I uh I

1058
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,920
like to kind of construct things I don't

1059
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,440
work on trying to break but I know from

1060
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,040
like folks here that do more security

1061
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:45,000
work and uh it's like uh people get in

1062
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,400
trouble for uh for breaking like uh for

1063
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,480
publishing and breaking things and uh I

1064
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,880
don't know they always we talk to them

1065
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,079
they always mention the word jail in

1066
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,640
their conversations it's like wow okay

1067
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,720
try to stay out of jail try to stay out

1068
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,839
of jail like okay no and you you know

1069
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,280
here in theory Land We it's pretty easy

1070
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:04,480
to St out a jail um they don't run after

1071
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:09,240
us uh

1072
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:11,760
so yeah but yeah you uh this can be a

1073
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,760
dangerous

1074
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:18,799
business any any other

1075
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:22,240
questions okay H so

1076
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:24,880
um I'm trying to think if I wanna maybe

1077
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,119
I'll end with a round by round soundness

1078
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,720
it's not as interesting but let me just

1079
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:33,680
say a few words on it because just uh so

1080
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:37,240
I can check the box I think it's

1081
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,359
yeah group you cannot do it in parallel

1082
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:42,640
good okay so the question

1083
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,680
was going back to the zero knowledge we

1084
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,240
said okay so zero knowledge if you

1085
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,680
repeat it sequentially it still stays

1086
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,200
zero knowledge okay it still say stay

1087
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,839
your knowledge because exactly the same

1088
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,440
reason as before each time I mean I can

1089
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,480
simulate essentially I can simulate this

1090
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,720
this transcript exactly the way I can

1091
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,200
kind

1092
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,599
of attack it in the random Oracle model

1093
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,160
it's like every time I so remember what

1094
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,240
is the definition of zeron alge which I

1095
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:13,359
believe I

1096
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,440
erased ah look at this I didn't okay so

1097
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,200
I want to say for every cheating

1098
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,240
improver for any cheating verifier I can

1099
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,640
simulate the transcript if I repeat and

1100
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,799
Peril I can simulate the transcript how

1101
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,720
I commit let I'm the simulator I'm going

1102
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:26,440
to simulate a transcript for you I

1103
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,599
commit at least at least a physical

1104
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:34,359
transcript with a commitment as a safe I

1105
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:39,920
commit I I I fake it till I make it I

1106
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:42,839
guess better one I commit I oh oh I hope

1107
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,640
V and then I compute

1108
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:48,799
varar answer on my commitment hope it's

1109
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:51,119
better one if it's better one I can open

1110
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,000
and I continue if it's not B when I try

1111
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,720
again and that's how I simulate the

1112
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
protocol exactly as I cheat in the

1113
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,240
random Mor

1114
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,720
what happens when things are sequential

1115
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,520
when things are

1116
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,359
sequential when things are parallel

1117
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,680
sorry when things are parallel now with

1118
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:12,520
in the parallel world you get alpha 1 up

1119
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,559
to Alpha Lambda so Lambda parall

1120
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,640
Petition of the commitments so you

1121
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,440
commit all the Matrix kind all the

1122
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,000
commitments Alpha One you commit you you

1123
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,920
do it in parallel you get all the beta

1124
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,280
one up to Beta Lambda tells you if to

1125
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,880
open with with respect to zero or one

1126
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,920
and then you need to do all the openings

1127
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,920
Gamma One up to gamma

1128
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:47,160
Lambda exactly the the i i the thing

1129
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,359
that helps me simulate is exactly the

1130
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,640
break of the random morical model

1131
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:56,839
exactly exactly now what happens if I do

1132
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:59,799
it in parallel if I do it in parallel

1133
00:55:56,839 --> 00:56:01,680
it's not okay if if V Star was was

1134
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:03,280
honest was completely honest then yes I

1135
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,000
I'll just simulate each one separately

1136
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,240
because he I can do the same thing I I

1137
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,039
just choose these like each one randomly

1138
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,400
Sim each one randomly simulate the thing

1139
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:16,200
is V Star may be malicious here's a

1140
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,839
really problematic VAR suppose V is such

1141
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,920
that I give him all the commitment so

1142
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:22,319
it's digital I so I told you in a save

1143
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,680
but actually there's cryptography going

1144
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,920
on in there let's kind let me just gloss

1145
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,720
over the crypto it's the is going to be

1146
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,280
dig digital so there's just

1147
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,359
bits and now suppose V St chooses beta

1148
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,240
and some function of alpha he applies

1149
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,960
some he's a cheating proof cheating

1150
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,319
verifier he wants to learn his goal is

1151
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:45,240
to learn and how does he learn he gets

1152
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:48,160
all these things he applies some f some

1153
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,559
function f to all of them together think

1154
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,079
of it like a random function I don't

1155
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:55,000
know like a and that's bet one of to

1156
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,400
Beta Lambda and that's what he sends me

1157
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,760
that's the cheating Pro

1158
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:04,200
now how do I simulate this I can I mean

1159
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,839
I can try I can guess beta

1160
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,559
one and try to get this I can't get

1161
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:11,640
guess all the betas at the same time the

1162
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:14,400
thing is I can try to guess beta one

1163
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:16,319
give a commitment here hope for the best

1164
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,920
but the problem is if I do alpha two the

1165
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,000
beta one may change because it's the

1166
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,200
betas are function of all the alphas

1167
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,480
together it's really not clear how to

1168
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,000
simulate

1169
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:29,799
this okay so the question hold is this

1170
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,920
zero knowledge and this was an open

1171
00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:36,200
problem for a very very long time uh

1172
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,160
over 20 years we had no idea people

1173
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,200
really

1174
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:44,760
tried a this we know because people did

1175
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:46,200
publish some partial results and we all

1176
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,240
work like everybody worked on it for a

1177
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,520
very long time uh we shared our

1178
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:56,240
frustration uh and then in

1179
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:59,280
2019 actually here at MIT uh and buun

1180
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,839
our neighborhood uh a bunch of people

1181
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:07,319
I'm going to tell you about it actually

1182
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:09,559
proved that this is not zero

1183
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:11,160
knowledge not Peril zero knowledge and

1184
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:13,760
the way the interesting thing the way

1185
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:18,200
they proved that it's not Zer knowledge

1186
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,400
is actually by proving that the f chamir

1187
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,280
is sound for this

1188
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:27,119
protocol which is very

1189
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:30,119
weird okay so what they prove

1190
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:33,880
is that this protocol this is

1191
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:36,119
a a uh three round protocol you can

1192
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:39,760
apply F chamir to

1193
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,359
it what they proved is if you so you

1194
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,240
know there was a question is f chamir

1195
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:45,280
sound you know in the standard model is

1196
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,920
it sound is sound nobody knew they gave

1197
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,079
kind of a breakthrough result showing it

1198
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,160
sound in the random Oracle model so

1199
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:55,160
that's what I'm going to show you next

1200
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:58,000
time next time we're going to prove that

1201
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:02,240
this protocol is actually

1202
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,280
sound in uh if you apply F to

1203
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,480
it the interesting thing is the fact

1204
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,799
that it

1205
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,799
sound if you

1206
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:13,400
apply shows so this we're going to show

1207
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:15,960
this is

1208
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,400
sound so of course it sound it's sound I

1209
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,720
mean if you just do per par petition

1210
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,640
you'll get

1211
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:25,599
soundness but it's also

1212
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:28,640
sound with there exists a hash function

1213
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:31,640
so there exists a hash

1214
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,319
function such that even this hash

1215
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,319
function under LW under a standard quic

1216
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:39,160
assumption known as learning with air

1217
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,760
we'll talk about later almost learning

1218
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,280
with air with circular security never

1219
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,799
mind there's a standard cryptographic

1220
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,559
assumption so that under that assumption

1221
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:52,880
there exists a hash

1222
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:59,640
family said that this protocol so so

1223
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:59,640
that uh this so that uh this protocol

1224
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:06,599
is is um let me call is

1225
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:21,039
uh is a f sound so it's sound even after

1226
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:26,280
you apply the

1227
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:29,359
F Paradigm to it yeah

1228
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:33,640
a specific protocol yeah and like not

1229
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:36,000
just any Z no not not any not any there

1230
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,599
may be zero knowledge protocols that are

1231
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,280
you can repeat in parallel and zero

1232
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:42,240
knowledge yeah sorry let me clarify I'm

1233
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,039
not

1234
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,599
saying that any zero knowledge protocol

1235
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:49,160
if you repeat it in parallel it's not

1236
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,680
zero knowledge anymore I'm not saying

1237
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:56,160
that I'm saying that this specific

1238
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:59,359
protocol for graph uh hamiltonian

1239
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,880
if you repeat this protocol in parallel

1240
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,319
it's not going to be zero knowledge and

1241
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,960
the reason it's not going to be zero

1242
01:01:03,319 --> 01:01:07,319
knowledge which is this is kind of

1243
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,400
should be really like what you you

1244
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:11,920
should not understand what I'm saying uh

1245
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,400
or at least it takes time to absorve

1246
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:18,039
absorb or at least to me it took time to

1247
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,960
absorb is the reason it's not zero

1248
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:23,960
knowledge is

1249
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:26,640
because actually this protocol is

1250
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,839
secure if you apply the fature it sound

1251
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,119
if you apply the

1252
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,720
F Paradigm to it and this is what we'll

1253
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:36,839
see next

1254
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,839
time so this is weird

1255
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:45,319
yeah exactly so why exactly so why is it

1256
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,920
why is it not zero knowledge so what

1257
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:48,960
does it mean to be zero knowledge it

1258
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,520
says what's the definition of zero

1259
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,319
knowledge zero know says for any varar

1260
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,480
you can

1261
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:59,680
simulate but now I'll I'll be a varar

1262
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:02,960
that you cannot simulate my VAR I'm

1263
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,240
going to be a f v I'm going to compute

1264
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,000
my Beta I'm V Star I want to learn

1265
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,359
something my goal is to learn something

1266
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,720
so I don't want to be able to simulate

1267
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:12,480
you that I didn't learn

1268
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:15,440
anything my goal is just to learn so how

1269
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,799
do I learn I'm gonna choose my

1270
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:21,200
datas as a f I'm gonna H I'm gonna use

1271
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:23,760
the F hash so you told me it sound

1272
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,559
there's some hash family that it sound

1273
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,440
great I'm going to choose a random hash

1274
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:30,880
key this family and my Beta is going to

1275
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:34,079
be has of

1276
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,480
alpha now you're saying you can simulate

1277
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:40,799
me for any ex you can simulate me if you

1278
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:43,279
can simulate me for any ex then you

1279
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:45,279
should be able also to simulate me for X

1280
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:46,480
in the language and for X outside the

1281
01:02:45,279 --> 01:02:49,119
language because you don't know which is

1282
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,039
in and which is out you're poly bounded

1283
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,079
yeah so let's say I want argue there's

1284
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,920
no

1285
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,200
simulator okay let me let me actually

1286
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,839
say this slowly so I'm not going to do

1287
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,480
this round by round on this uh today

1288
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:05,440
it's not that interesting uh but it will

1289
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,440
come maybe to haunt us later but let

1290
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:10,640
me it's nicer to do and we'll just end

1291
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,960
with that we have a couple minutes left

1292
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,720
we'll just end with

1293
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,720
that okay

1294
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:22,760
so again next time we'll see that Peril

1295
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:25,240
repetition of this specific protocol

1296
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,920
with a specific commitment okay with a

1297
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:31,880
specific digital

1298
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:35,480
save is sound when you apply the F to it

1299
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,480
okay now here's the

1300
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:42,680
claim

1301
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,680
soundness or Fe CH

1302
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:52,079
soundness implies that it's

1303
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,079
not zero

1304
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:58,680
knowledge and let me argue that let me

1305
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:58,680
argue that so here's the

1306
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,240
proof suppose it's zero knowledge okay

1307
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,279
so suppose it's wrong suppose I'm going

1308
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,200
to get a contradiction so Suppose there

1309
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:10,039
exist a

1310
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,760
simulator a

1311
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:15,279
PPT there's an efficient

1312
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:17,319
simulator such that I'm just copying the

1313
01:04:15,279 --> 01:04:19,000
definition suppos it's zero knowledge it

1314
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:23,680
means that there's an efficient

1315
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,680
simulator such that for any poly siiz V

1316
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,680
Star

1317
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:33,960
for any cheating

1318
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:35,559
verifier and for every X in the language

1319
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,079
you can

1320
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:41,160
simulate okay so for every for every X

1321
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:44,400
Sim what does Sim

1322
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:49,760
do see an input

1323
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:53,359
X outputs like Alpha Beta gamma that are

1324
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,200
accepted with respect to

1325
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:58,319
X okay because uh

1326
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,720
because the prover is accepted he's

1327
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,920
honest so the Prov is always accepted

1328
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,279
you're talking with an honest prover

1329
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,279
that has a

1330
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:12,119
witness okay so so he should also accept

1331
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:15,480
they're indistinguishable real and ideal

1332
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:16,760
like the real view should be in from the

1333
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,920
the real view should be inum from the

1334
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,000
simulated view the real view output

1335
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,319
something that's accepted so the

1336
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,200
simulator should out put something

1337
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:27,839
that's accepted okay now so first first

1338
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:33,480
I want to argue this

1339
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:36,000
implies that also for X not an L or for

1340
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:38,200
random I should say for or there exists

1341
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,200
at

1342
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:48,880
least such that

1343
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:48,880
Sim and X also outputs Alpha Beta

1344
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:54,640
gamma that are

1345
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,240
accepted so this is

1346
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:00,559
accepted I'll write it like and so this

1347
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,559
should also be accepted

1348
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,520
why why so I want to argue if for every

1349
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,880
ACC in the

1350
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,000
language this efficient

1351
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,240
simulator with orle access to an

1352
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,119
efficient

1353
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,480
verifier with an expected

1354
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,920
transcript there must be one at least

1355
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,200
one exent of the language so that he

1356
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,640
output something that's accepting

1357
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,240
because he can't distinguish in the Ling

1358
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,839
it's hard problem and he's efficient if

1359
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,599
all the time that it's in the language

1360
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:31,160
he outputs accepting and all the time

1361
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:35,160
not in the language then the simulator

1362
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:38,920
broke broke your language he broke n p

1363
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,720
okay so that can't be so there exists X

1364
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,119
not in the language for which he manages

1365
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,039
the gener valid

1366
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:50,200
transcript that breaks the because what

1367
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:53,720
does varar do VAR this means that this

1368
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,720
is hash

1369
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:02,960
of X in

1370
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:08,839
Alpha that's my V Star my V Star applies

1371
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:12,440
F I'm I'm I'm I so okay the V Star that

1372
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:16,599
I'm interested in is the f v star it

1373
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:19,440
takes we assumed that the f is sound

1374
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,440
with respect as some

1375
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:26,799
H this V Star this V Star is going to

1376
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,520
use that h he's going to choose a random

1377
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:30,799
hash key and he's G to choose that's how

1378
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:33,880
he chooses the

1379
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:36,520
beta or he's going to fix an random hash

1380
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,160
key is fixed that's it that's a hash key

1381
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:42,039
it's fixed now Sim has to use that hash

1382
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:42,039
key because otherwise you can

1383
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,520
distinguish so he broke the F so he

1384
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:51,079
broke the

1385
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:53,160
F that means he cannot

1386
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:55,640
simulate there's no simulator a

1387
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:58,400
simulator will break the F so it's kind

1388
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:00,599
of an interesting kind of people

1389
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,160
believed it was a weird state of the

1390
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:04,799
world because people

1391
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,319
believed that in some sense that

1392
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,400
parallel zero knowledge should hold why

1393
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:11,000
not you can't learn what can you learn

1394
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,559
try to learn but people also learn that

1395
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,600
future me is true but these two these

1396
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:19,199
two are not uh don't you can't believe

1397
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,440
both you know and it wasn't clear which

1398
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:23,679
one is the right thing and so now we

1399
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,239
know at least for this protocol f chir

1400
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,920
is is true and it's not zero knowledge

1401
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,960
yeah show something stronger like any

1402
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,040
non

1403
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,799
interactive can be zero knowledge

1404
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,480
basically any any interactive proofer

1405
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:40,480
Which F CH holds can add be zero

1406
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:43,480
knowledge exactly

1407
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,480
yeah

1408
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:56,600
Usef exactly exctly no interaction zero

1409
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:00,640
yeah that's what the pro I see

1410
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,640
yeah yeah yeah okay we're out of time
