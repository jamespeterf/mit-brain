1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Well, I have the absolute privilege of

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,639
welcoming you to the last session of uh

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,880
2025 uh Nanosummit. Um indeed uh this

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,840
session is very special to me, very

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,560
special to all of us here at MIT Nano.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,480
Um it is a session uh we called honoring

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
visionaries in nanocience and

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,720
nanotechnology.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,280
So uh this afternoon we celebrate

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,239
vision leadership

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
qualities that have shaped MIT's role in

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,040
advancing nanocience and nanotechnology

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,200
for years and years and that vision and

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
leadership indeed continues uh through

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,239
what we are doing at MIT nano. You have

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,039
just seen the leaders of tomorrow

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,399
present many great advancements and

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,199
indeed just 0.5% of what actually is

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,960
happening inside our facility.

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:07,520
So a visionary who has been central to

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,400
the story of MIT is MIT's 17th president

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,119
Rafael Refe and I have a distinct honor

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,479
of welcoming him to stage in a moment. I

24
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,720
just want to say a couple of words

25
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,640
before I do so because I believe last

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,640
time he introduced me he said a couple

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,759
of words as well and I tremendously

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,799
appreciated it. Um over the course of

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,920
his career at MIT Rafael's impact on

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,040
both MIT and the field of science

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,159
technology and in particular nanocience

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,360
has been profound. um as a faculty

33
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,680
member he saw the importance of creating

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,720
shared facilities that could bring

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,200
researchers together. And of course the

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,960
very next thing he did is he became the

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,360
director of micros systemystems

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,840
technology labs the predecessor to the

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,920
present MIT Nano an organization that

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,200
defined the path that we are now

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,000
following. He worked to expand those

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,079
shared fabrication spaces and build

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
communities because indeed it's those

44
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,720
communities that build tomorrow that

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,160
human friction of interaction that

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
places like the fab like

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,959
characterization like the immersion lab

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,800
of nano can indeed enable.

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,360
As president of MIT, he championed bold

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,440
investments in research infrastructure

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,440
uh by making MIT Nano possible, ensuring

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,080
MIT could remain at the forefront of

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,280
nanocience discovery.

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,680
Nationally, President Reefe extended

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,720
Vene Bush's vision for the endless

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,840
frontier advanced through academic

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,080
discovery. His tireless efforts shape

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,879
the continued national commitment to

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,920
science and technology advancements and

60
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,319
indeed for years to come. We are changed

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,480
because of what President Reefe has done

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,720
for all of us.

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,720
Because of his leadership here on campus

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,760
and his belief in a power of shared

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,959
discovery, MIT Nano, the innovation

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,560
powerhouse that he stood up, now

67
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,319
supports more than 1,500 users across

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
more than 50 departments. I mentioned

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,560
this at the beginning. That's at this

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,519
point after seven years of existence, tw

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,760
over 20% of MIT research groups touch

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,480
MIT Nano to accomplish their needs. So I

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,879
cannot think of a better messenger to

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,440
tell us about the legacies that he built

75
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:36,319
upon shaped by Vanver Bush and then by a

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,680
remarkable MIT alum Robert Bob Noise

77
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,760
whose story you're about to hear.

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,500
President Reefe, please join me on

79
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,650
stage.

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,270
[Music]

81
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,270
[Applause]

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,120
Vladimir, thank you for such a very

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,720
generous introduction. I guess um if I

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
want you to tone it down, I'll take care

85
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,239
of it at my next introduction of you.

86
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,640
You have heard uh today mostly about the

87
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,799
future and the future you're building.

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,880
My few minutes of remarks is about the

89
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,519
past and where we come from at least at

90
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,120
MIT. So I'm extremely honored and

91
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,960
delighted truly to join you at this Nano

92
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Summit. Uh but also importantly to

93
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,240
announce that we are dedicating the

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:39,960
clean room at MIT Nano in honor of

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,960
Robert Noise of the MIT class of 1953.

96
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,960
As most of you know, I'm sure Bob is the

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,199
person who put the silicon in Silicon

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:01,120
Valley by inventing the first monolithic

99
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,919
integrated circuit based on Silicon.

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,800
In fact, for many years during his

101
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,320
lifetime, he was referred to as the

102
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,960
mayor of Silicon Valley.

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
More than anyone else, it was Bob Noise

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,520
who sparked the micro electronics

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,240
revolution.

106
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,120
His legacy, however, is about much more

107
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,080
than technological brilliance, which he

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,039
certainly was in leaps and bounds. He

109
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,800
co-founded virtual semiconductor and

110
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:36,320
then Intel where he served as its first

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
CEO and where he oversaw the invention

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,199
and commercialization of the micro

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,600
processor.

114
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
Bob noise set new standards for

115
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,080
entrepreneurship

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,440
uh and entrepreneurial leadership in

117
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,080
tech and in the valley as well and it

118
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,639
was a template for generations to follow

119
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:02,680
including that of many MIT alumni.

120
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,680
He was a leading legend.

121
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,440
One day shortly after I became MTL

122
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,800
director, I was informed that Bob Noise

123
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,919
was visiting MIT that day and had

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,080
requested to meet with me.

125
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,800
I was wearing my regular professorial

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,639
outfit, an open color shirt and a

127
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,000
sweater.

128
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,000
I decided that I could not meet such a

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,080
living legend dressed so casually.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,600
So, I asked my assistant to run to the

131
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,600
MIT coupe to find me a tie. Any tie

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
ASAP.

133
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,440
I was desperate not to appear

134
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,560
disrespectful.

135
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,680
She came back right on time. And then

136
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,479
Bob Noise showed up my office

137
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,840
without a tie. Of course he did because

138
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,720
another of his innovations was an

139
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,639
unpretentious informal management style

140
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,280
that has characterized tech ever since.

141
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,319
In fact, in his honor, I'm not wearing a

142
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,639
tie today.

143
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,039
I also want to take this unique

144
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:18,880
opportunity to thank Ray Sta of the

145
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,199
classes of 1957 and 1958

146
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,639
whose generosity has allowed MIT to

147
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,840
honor Bob Noise in such a fitting way.

148
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,840
Ray, do you mind raising your hand?

149
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,800
[Applause]

150
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,840
Rey again I told you that my remarks

151
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,960
were about history. Rey was a peer of

152
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,800
Bob Noise in co-ounding analog devices

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,240
in Cambridge in 1965 and growing it into

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,479
a global leader in signal processing

155
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,639
and processing devices.

156
00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:00,479
Ray's data was for the east coast while

157
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:04,080
Bob Noise was for the west coast.

158
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:08,720
Ray also was and is the driving force

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,360
behind nanoscale research at MIT.

160
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,039
The whole idea of what eventually became

161
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,080
the micro systems technology

162
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,199
laboratories at MIT and MIT's first

163
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,680
classroom facilities in building 39 was

164
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,520
pushed by Rey.

165
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,520
In order to wheel MTL into being, he had

166
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,319
numerous meetings with the MIT

167
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,159
administration at the time to convince

168
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,800
them to make such a bold step. And of

169
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,360
course, Analog Devices was the first

170
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,080
company to commit financial support to

171
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,480
MTL.

172
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,720
Race data also deserves credit for

173
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,480
physically bringing together electrical

174
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,240
engineering and computer science at MIT

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,000
which were on opposite sides of the

176
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,720
street until he gave us building 12 the

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Ray and Maria Stata Center for Computer

178
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,920
Information and Intelligent Sciences.

179
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:11,279
Moreover, Ray Stata gave MIT the first

180
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,279
gift that allowed us to launch MIT Nano

181
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
and Ray has been a driving force in my

182
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,480
own career.

183
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,120
When I joined MIT in 1980, it was as the

184
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,760
first holder of the analog devices

185
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,360
career development professorship which

186
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Ry established in 2022. I had the great

187
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,000
honor of receiving an award named for

188
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,440
him from the Massachusetts High

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,360
Technology Council. And today I'm the

190
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,040
Ray and Maria STA professor of

191
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,040
electrical engineering and computer

192
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,040
science.

193
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,800
When Rey pushes something good always

194
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,000
happens.

195
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,080
So I want to also thank him for

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,560
insisting over decades that MIT remain

197
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,080
at the leading edge in the semiconductor

198
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
space

199
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,279
even when

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,399
even when the country itself thought it

201
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,959
had left advanced chief fabrication far

202
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,760
behind.

203
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,120
When MTL was conceived just as I was

204
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,720
arriving at MIT, it was seen as utterly

205
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,839
necessary.

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,640
The US still manufactured over half over

207
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,279
half of the world's semiconductors and

208
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,279
MIT needed to educate experts for that

209
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,800
industry.

210
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,440
The challenge of course was that

211
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,399
semiconductor laboratories were and

212
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,640
still are extremely expensive.

213
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,440
So it could only make sense in a

214
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,760
university if it was going to be used by

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
a large number of faculty research

216
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,320
groups.

217
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,880
MTL's pioneering faculty solved that

218
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,440
challenge in part by creating a

219
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,000
tremendously attractive collaborative

220
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,240
and collegial culture which included

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,279
weekly microlunches that still exist

222
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,440
today that faculty wanted to join and be

223
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,560
part of.

224
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,440
In 1990, I became the second director of

225
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,880
MTL and had the privilege of serving in

226
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,720
that role for nine years.

227
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,640
But

228
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,360
as the new millennium began, MI MTL

229
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,920
facilities were becoming outdated in

230
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,600
equipment, in space, and some would

231
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,519
argue in concept.

232
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,959
In 1985, Japan had surpassed the US in

233
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,200
global semiconductor market share.

234
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,600
In 1987,

235
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,120
another contemporary of race data and

236
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,959
Bob Noise, Moraurice Chang of the MIT

237
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,880
class of 1952 and 53 had established

238
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,079
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing

239
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,399
Company or TSMC, reshaping the industry

240
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,839
with a foundry model that separate the

241
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,880
manufacturing and design.

242
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,079
And by the year 2000, US Fabs were

243
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,880
producing less than 20% of the world's

244
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,720
semiconductor chips.

245
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,760
Chip manufacturing had become very

246
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,200
capital intensive. The thinking in

247
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,079
industry at that time was that if Asia

248
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,240
wanted to do chip manufacturing, let

249
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:26,079
Asia do it. The US would concentrate on

250
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,800
where the real value added was on cheap

251
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,240
design.

252
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,480
The US also largely stopped investing in

253
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,839
educating students in the semiconductor

254
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,240
space. This included even universities

255
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,839
such as UC Berkeley and Stanford at the

256
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,760
heart of Silicon Valley. In that era, I

257
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:52,279
would regularly hear in Silicon Valley

258
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,279
that software eats hardware for lunch.

259
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,000
I did not subscribe to that claim.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,279
Of course, software and digital

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,920
technologies were are and will continue

262
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,760
to be critical to the economy locally

263
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,680
and globally, but software runs on

264
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,160
hardware.

265
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,279
Advances in one enable and stimulate

266
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,120
advances in the other. Advances in chip

267
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,240
technology and cheap manufacturing make

268
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,160
possible advances in chip design which

269
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,399
in turn make possible advances in

270
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:30,480
artificial intelligence and vice versa.

271
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,560
And I knew that the emphasizing hardware

272
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,519
was going to come back to haunt the

273
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,600
United States.

274
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,920
So when I became provos at MIT in 2005,

275
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,200
I had the opportunity to do something

276
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,079
about it. Fortunately, the deans of

277
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,360
engineering and science at MIT were in

278
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,320
agreement and with their support, MIT

279
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,880
made the bold decision to double down on

280
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,440
semiconductor research and education by

281
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,959
creating MIT Nano just as everyone else

282
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,360
was moving away.

283
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,399
Then came the supply chain shortages of

284
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,680
the pandemic and the US government

285
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,959
suddenly realized that it was a national

286
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,120
security issue when virtually all of the

287
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,480
world's most advanced chips are

288
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,320
manufactured in Asia.

289
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,680
When then Secretary of Commerce Jenna

290
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
Ryondo came to tour MIT Nano into in

291
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,120
2022,

292
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,000
right before the Chiefs and Science Act

293
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:40,120
passed, she said to me, referring to MIT

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,120
Nano, the country needs 10 of this.

295
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,360
Clearly, the future will rely on both

296
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,440
algorithms and semiconductor chips. I

297
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,680
believe that MIT needed to be at the

298
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,160
leading edge of algorithms as well,

299
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,320
which is how the Schwarzman College of

300
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,000
Computing, this building came into

301
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,079
being.

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,560
And with MIT Nano, MIT now has vastly

303
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,600
improved facilities and equipment for

304
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,199
the hardware end of the spectrum.

305
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,079
Moreover, MIT Nano expanded the welcome

306
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,360
offered by what was always a supremely

307
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,920
welcoming community. It has allowed even

308
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,320
more faculty, students and entrepreneurs

309
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,680
across the institute as well as industry

310
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:31,199
leaders and government entities to solve

311
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,440
major research challenges in MIT Nano.

312
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,240
In 2022,

313
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,279
it was a distinct pleasure to name the

314
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,519
home of MIT Nano after Lisa Sue, CEO and

315
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,240
chair of AMD.

316
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,199
Another semiconductor industry leader

317
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,600
educated at MIT.

318
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,880
Lisa, by the way, is MIT through and

319
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,440
through. She has not one but three

320
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,120
degrees from MIT, a bachelor's, a

321
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,920
master's, and a PhD.

322
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,920
Finally, I want to finish by thanking

323
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,399
all of you for being so patient to

324
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,440
listen to so much ancient history.

325
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,480
However, MIT

326
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,800
at the nano scale is a story of

327
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:24,880
leadership that continues to this day.

328
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,199
From Bob Noise to race data to Morris

329
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,279
Chang in the early days of the industry

330
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,680
to Lisa Sue today, MIT has educated a

331
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,959
large number of remarkable leaders in

332
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,240
the semiconductor space.

333
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,519
Now with the Robert Noise clean room,

334
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,040
this remarkable MIT community is ready

335
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,959
to continue to shape the future

336
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
with the next generation of nano

337
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,519
discoveries. You heard many of those

338
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,560
today and the next generation of nano

339
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,240
leaders who themselves will become

340
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,160
living legends in their future.

341
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,480
Thank you so much for including me in

342
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,760
such an important day and thank you for

343
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,000
allowing me to listen to your

344
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,609
spectacular presentations today. Thank

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,339
you.

346
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:13,339
[Applause]
