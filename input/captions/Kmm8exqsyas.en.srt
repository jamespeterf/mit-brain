1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:07,319
all right well welcome everyone um it's

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,080
nice to see you and it's uh I'm sure and

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,719
that we'll hear I hope from the people

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,360
who are joining us on Zoom this morning

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,160
um the title of my talk is an updated

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,760
perspective on gwi Association studies

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,519
um I do want to get into some

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,240
fundamentals of um the study design and

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,560
methodology behind a genomite

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,480
Association study but I'm going to um

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,120
wrap up the the primer lecture on uh

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,840
showcasing a modern genomite Association

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,239
study one that was just published a

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,960
couple months ago and and really

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,640
showcases the power of this singular

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,879
tool in um human genetics and genetic

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,199
epidemiology um and then I'll I'll I'll

18
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:57,280
I'll wrap up with a um with a a very

19
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,320
short vignette on how we can leverage

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
the results of many different genomite

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,600
associations studies to try to

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,040
understand some fundamental um aspects

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,040
of of a particular um trait or

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,360
disease so um genomite Association

25
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,680
studies um leverage a fundamental

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
Concept in genetic epidemiology called

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,400
heritability um heritability is a

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,759
statistic um on a disease or a trait um

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,320
that estimates the degree of variation

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,000
in the in this trait in a pop population

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,920
that is due to genetic variation between

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,600
individuals in that population um there

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,000
are many ways to estimate heritability

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,680
um I've listed a couple of the most

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,960
common uh techniques um we can compare

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,960
individual phenotypic variation among

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,759
related individuals in a population um

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,759
if you have a a study design um of a

39
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,399
nuclear family for example you know

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,280
expected uh um uh trait U Co ices

41
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,200
between the individuals and the families

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,000
based on the amount of uh the uh the

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,720
genetic uh the DNA that's been inherit

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,599
inherited um um through the pedigree um

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,599
you can also estimate heritability by

46
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,760
estim examining the association between

47
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,040
individual genotype and genotype data um

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,920
and by modeling summ summary level data

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,560
from genom Association studies so um you

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,360
only really perform a genom Association

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,519
study on a trait that is heritable um um

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,760
as you know the the purpose of a

53
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,720
genomite Association study is to um

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,760
discover particular genetic variants

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,239
that are associated with your outcome um

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,599
and if a trait has no heritability then

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,319
uh perhaps you would go looking other

58
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,400
epidemiological methods to find the

59
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,640
relationships between that trait and

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,000
other things other risk factors not

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,159
genetic risk factors

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,720
um the another fundamental principle of

63
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,720
um genomite Association studies is the

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,400
this idea of genetic architecture of

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,120
human diseases and complex traits now a

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,519
genetic architecture of a trait um is a

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,120
is comprised of the number of genetic

68
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,560
Losi that are associated with um that

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,720
trait their frequencies if being common

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,120
low frequency are rare and then their

71
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,519
effects and the strong strong or weak so

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,680
this this um graphic that I have up here

73
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,319
is is from a 2008 review um in nature

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,280
reviews genetics that showcases that

75
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,920
when you have a very rare variant with

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,840
high penetrants those are the type of V

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,760
variants that are studied in rare

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,879
disease genetics um whereas in um

79
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,920
genomewide Association studies uh We've

80
00:03:51,879 --> 00:04:00,079
most of the variants that are discovered

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,079
are common frequency and uh low effect

82
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,560
may I ask a question about that abely

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,360
yes um in that bottom leftand corner are

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,840
there really cases where the the VAP is

85
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,439
very low with uh weak effects or is that

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,200
just we're filling up the entire space

87
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,519
with the bubble um you mean that the

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,079
hard to identify genetically section

89
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:25,479
well back in 2008 um the tech the abil

90
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,520
our ability to um uh find genetic

91
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,600
variants with ver that were so rare um

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,680
in the for the purpose of genomite

93
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,000
Association studies was very limited um

94
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,039
so I would say that um nowadays we have

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,240
a much better um ability to identify

96
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,800
variants that are very rare that have

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,039
low effect because we have um in many

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,600
cases whole genome sequence Association

99
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,400
studies that are being performed so

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,840
cohorts with with um full uh spectrum of

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,440
genetic variation du to the the fact

102
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,800
that the technique of whole genome

103
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,479
sequencing has been um um performed on

104
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,479
the

105
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,840
samples um

106
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,440
so I would and I'll say another bit is

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,680
statistical power which I'll talk about

108
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,560
a little bit I will play a role in being

109
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,479
able to identify genetic variants that

110
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,280
are very rare with low and mod moderate

111
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:24,080
effects um so extremely large sample

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,840
sizes would be necessary in that case

113
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,840
are there any other

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,919
questions all right so the purpose of a

115
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,400
genomite Association study on a

116
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,440
particular trait is to dis discover or

117
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,160
Define the genetic architecture of that

118
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,000
trait in the particular um with with the

119
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,240
data sets that you have

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,759
available the generated genotypes

121
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,800
Etc so we um most commonly or

122
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,960
traditionally the genomite association

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,360
study tests this common disease common

124
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,600
variant

125
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:06,319
hypothesis um so uh gas were developed

126
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,319
for variants that were of some level of

127
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,759
frequency of high enough frequency in

128
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,039
the human population to have been put on

129
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,440
this

130
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:20,240
technical um product called the

131
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:23,639
genotyping array um and simply we've got

132
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,960
um single nucleotide polymorphisms Snips

133
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,919
which now have um we have the ability to

134
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:36,080
um read out um gen IC variation that is

135
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:39,800
more than just a a a a coding change but

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,240
that might span many uh from you know to

137
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,240
be a deletion of an alal or a variant um

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:52,000
or or be a a substitution so so nowadays

139
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:56,400
we have a the ability to U see much more

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,120
sophisticated um alic variance variation

141
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,039
than just single nucleotide poly

142
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,759
polymorphisms

143
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,400
but uh generally we we in the situ we

144
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,759
have an alil A Place In The genome where

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,000
there is a change um and the leil has a

146
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,400
kind of a observed frequency in the

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
sample in the population that you're

148
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,120
studying and our hypothesis is asking

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,319
the question you know is the presence of

150
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,319
this nippol Associated or correlated

151
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,680
with our disease and trait so C alil

152
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,160
being perhaps I think the example that I

153
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,000
have circled here with the 25% frequency

154
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,120
in this certain population we want to

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,240
know if the C Al is associated with the

156
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,720
trait we generally want to just scan the

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,039
genome and at every alil where

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,879
there's there's a you know a variant

159
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,759
observed um asked this question so we're

160
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,319
going to be performing a statistical

161
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,199
test at you know millions and millions

162
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,960
of places along the genome but you know

163
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,960
us if you're going to be performing a

164
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:03,759
statistical analysis you have to um put

165
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:07,639
together a model of of the the variables

166
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:11,400
in your Association analysis and um that

167
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,759
requires the us as the analysts you know

168
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:19,520
studying this question to um decide how

169
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,800
we're going to treat the um this genetic

170
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,759
uh the genotypes and The alals observed

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,840
at this particular location how are we

172
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,599
going to code them for our numerical

173
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,719
analysis so that um uh where as as we

174
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,120
look for a

175
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:39,760
correlation um I'm putting up here the

176
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,560
three common genetic models um and uh

177
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,760
depiction of of what model what we we

178
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,839
are imposing in terms of what we're

179
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,240
looking for in in this um in this

180
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,279
statistical analysis the additive model

181
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
um is one where at this particular

182
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,519
location you're looking for a

183
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,560
correlation with or an effect of the C

184
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,880
alal for every individual you'll be

185
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,640
counting um how many Cals they have in

186
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,640
their genotype so an individual analysis

187
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:15,399
has either a zero one or two as the

188
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,000
variable value um that's used in our

189
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,600
analysis uh you could also model a

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,640
dominant or recessive um effect U

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,399
nowadays there are statistical tools

192
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,440
that allow you to do gws with um more uh

193
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,399
sophisticated models like a dominant

194
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,920
model or recessive

195
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,200
model

196
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,440
um this is one of the things where uh

197
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,519
after 1520 years of doing Goos I just

198
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,959
take for granted but um when when Doo M

199
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,480
Association first started there was a

200
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:52,040
question about what was the best coding

201
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,240
of an Al if you're doing a scan of you

202
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,519
know millions of alals across the human

203
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,240
genome um and there was some literature

204
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,079
that came out that um that uh

205
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,519
concluded that if you don't know what

206
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,200
the model is then the added model will

207
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,120
be the best you know generalized model

208
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,600
to use in the uh you know for these

209
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,880
millions of

210
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,880
variants any questions about this I did

211
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,399
build a bit of um time um here for for

212
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,360
us to have questions I think if you have

213
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,079
a question you should go to the

214
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,720
microphone or get get it be passed along

215
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:31,200
to you ah thank you y in the graph in

216
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,480
the bottom left left what's the Y AIS

217
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,079
right um so um think of a a like a

218
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,079
regression analysis where you're trying

219
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,360
to find a best fit um between in a

220
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:47,399
relationship between a covariant and

221
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:52,200
your outcome so um so if we were going

222
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:56,680
to um that this uh this line could uh

223
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,880
represent the uh um the expected change

224
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,240
in the trait value between people zero

225
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,399
or one or one and two as their kind of

226
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:11,680
value for the genotype for the AL yeah

227
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:14,560
so um I would say that this this is

228
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,240
maybe like an idealized model whereas in

229
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,000
real in for a real analysis you'd have a

230
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,680
scatter of lots of different points and

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,279
you're trying to do a best fit like just

232
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,760
a regression type analysis is there a

233
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,320
question from online uh yeah we had one

234
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,560
online if you could go back to the

235
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,760
figure with the effect size and the Leal

236
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,959
frequency

237
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,279
that bottom left corner Nicole was

238
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,639
asking about um ah yes yep that that

239
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,160
size of that bubble they're saying is

240
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,120
still probably a pretty big bubble but

241
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,440
we don't have the heterogen across

242
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,440
populations to be able to capture those

243
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,560
variants yeah so so yes the point is

244
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,120
that low frequency variants that have

245
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,000
slow effects are still going to be hard

246
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,360
to identify because um looking at the

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,040
right population or looking across many

248
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,200
populations um heterogeneity in the uh

249
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,600
the fact that the AL Leo may not exist

250
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,320
in some human populations and so there's

251
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,519
lots of sources of um heterogenity I

252
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,720
would say that would contribute to these

253
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,240
variants being hard to explore so that

254
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,959
sounded Blessed Like a question but

255
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,040
maybe a comment I appreciate that and

256
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,040
people who are on the on the zoom you

257
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,880
can feel free to fill in and you know

258
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,680
more comments because I'm going to keep

259
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,839
things at a pretty high level during

260
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,920
this this primer go ahead in which in

261
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,920
which case would you use a dominant or

262
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,120
recessive model over like an additive

263
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,800
model so like in what context is that

264
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,399
better I would say if you want to do a

265
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,199
genetic Discovery analysis um and you

266
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,519
want to explore the you just you want to

267
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:52,959
test the um the uh possibility of there

268
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,560
being genetic alals with a meres of

269
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,800
effect across the genome in the field of

270
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,720
type two diabetes uh we recently had a

271
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,480
paper published

272
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,360
showing the results of a gen a recessive

273
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,920
genetic a recessive model gwas at a very

274
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,800
large one and then so that was quite

275
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,040
interesting for us to find the genetic

276
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,680
alals that show a recessive effect but

277
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,360
not an an additive effect yeah so it's

278
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,560
just another technique in terms of the

279
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,680
discovery of um genetic variations and

280
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,720
and exploring the genetic architecture

281
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,560
of a trait thanks so I think if it's a

282
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,240
if you have if you have a hypothesis

283
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,839
that things could be um there could be

284
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,320
genetic variants under that have a

285
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,760
recessive model or dominant model or we

286
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,120
want to explore it's you know you would

287
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,560
just uh employ one of those statistical

288
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:48,399
tools that U model recessive effect in

289
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,399
Gs all right so implementing

290
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,600
implementing a statistical a GW

291
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,399
statistical tests here I think it's

292
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,600
really important that if you're about to

293
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,600
embark on performing a genomewide

294
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,639
Association study

295
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,880
um or or trying to understand a genomite

296
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,600
Association study that you find a good

297
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,000
textbook that um it starts with some

298
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,759
fundamentals and

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,560
biostatistics um and uh start

300
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,480
understanding the distribution of out

301
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,920
your outcome and covariates make correct

302
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,720
statistical modeling I would say any

303
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,360
genomite association study start apart

304
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,279
from the genetics looking at your

305
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:32,199
outcome covariant confounding you know

306
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:35,320
making sure that you understand the um

307
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:36,399
the outcome that you're studying uh and

308
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,240
um

309
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,079
are using the appropriate covariates to

310
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,240
control for confounding in your model

311
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,399
I'm not going to talk too much more

312
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,880
about this but um there's tons of

313
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,800
literature out there about um using

314
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,920
genetic principal components as a a

315
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,560
method to control for the problem of

316
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,880
population structure and this

317
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,920
uh the problem is generally stated as

318
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,000
there being differences in AAL

319
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,480
frequencies between groups in your

320
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,279
analysis sample that that track that are

321
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,680
correlated with the differences in the

322
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:20,040
trait or disease that you're studying so

323
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,199
um before you you employ a Goos study

324
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,600
the the um associations between your

325
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,519
outcomes and your co-variates and

326
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,199
understand the structure of your sample

327
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:34,519
so that you um are starting off with a a

328
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,680
a good epidemiological model before you

329
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,440
add in

330
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,360
the genetic variance from the

331
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,480
gws so y the basic question I'm just

332
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,920
repeating it here are the AL the

333
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,720
genotypes of the snip correlated with

334
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,360
the phenotype so for quantitative trait

335
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,759
quantitative traits here are some

336
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,120
examples height blood pressure

337
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,360
measurements gene expression levels

338
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,920
other physiological measures So within a

339
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,040
cohort you have um these variables

340
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:11,160
available to you um we set up a simple

341
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,440
regression framework and most all modern

342
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,839
Geno Association study methods or tools

343
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,319
and techniques just extend this model

344
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,079
and there are edge cases and there are

345
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,800
some pretty cool methods that are out

346
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,480
there but for the purpose of this primer

347
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,279
I want us all to just become familiar

348
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:33,639
with the the the the basic model model

349
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:35,440
that's that's being explored here so um

350
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,800
again if you're not familiar with a a

351
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,040
regression linear regression or multiple

352
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,040
linear regression and you want to become

353
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,680
more familiar with it I would I would

354
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,639
have you go back to some um basic

355
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,720
biostatistics textbooks and just um

356
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,399
start learning about trait variability

357
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,639
correlation and then regression and then

358
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,319
multiple

359
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,959
regression um so we're going to fit a

360
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,560
regression

361
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,839
best fit line like that between a trait

362
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,679
and a snip controlling for your

363
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,559
Compounders um and and if there is a

364
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,120
relationship the the regression estimate

365
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,640
which here I have represented by this

366
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,880
beta snip will be

367
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,559
nonzero um generally if there's you know

368
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,280
we would not expect the um uh the

369
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,959
regression estimate to be nonzero if

370
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,039
there is no association so under the

371
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,760
null hypothesis which is a statistical

372
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:36,080
term for no effect

373
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,919
um we we our estimate will um have

374
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,640
estimates of those variance under M

375
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,160
hypothesis would be zero um of course

376
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,440
when you're sampling they're not which

377
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,360
is what we're going to get into in a

378
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,280
couple minutes about false positives but

379
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,720
um for a uh snip that is associated with

380
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,240
your trait when your um regression

381
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,000
estimate is greater than zero then you

382
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,320
interpret that as saying the alil is

383
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,159
associated with higher values of the

384
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,840
trait and when the estimate is is less

385
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,280
than zero your Al is associated with i a

386
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,280
typo lower values of the

387
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,320
trait now if you have a case control

388
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,000
study design or a binary trait um the

389
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,960
the question becomes if there a

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,480
different in a frequencies between cases

391
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,799
and controls and then the um previous

392
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,280
regression framework is extended into a

393
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:28,919
logistic regression um where the out the

394
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,640
uh the effect estimate is an odds ratio

395
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,240
which is a measure of the increased or

396
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,760
decreased risk of this disease on a m

397
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,520
multiplicative scale and and the odds

398
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,000
ratio under where there's no effect

399
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,080
would it be expected to be one um so an

400
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,679
odds ratio greater than one it it means

401
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,919
that there's increased risk of disease

402
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,840
associated with the Al and odds ratio

403
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,480
less than one decreased risk of disease

404
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,480
associated with the

405
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:02,640
AL um when you perform a statistic iCal

406
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,720
test you're going to have a P value as a

407
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,200
result of the statistical test the

408
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,400
definition of a P value is a probability

409
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,760
so it's it's it's a chance of observing

410
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,200
as strong of an effect as the one you

411
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,559
have in front of you for that particular

412
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,280
variant if there is no

413
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,159
association um and so uh I'm getting

414
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,600
into some more statistical language so

415
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:28,280
if this is unfamiliar to you then I

416
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,120
would again uh invite you to go and

417
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,679
explore for um some of the fundamentals

418
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,960
of biostatistics but when we're um

419
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,080
setting up a statistical experiment we

420
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,320
also we we set prior to doing our

421
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,480
experiment a kind of a false positive

422
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,919
rate that we would expect to um well

423
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,159
that we're going to use and uh you'll

424
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,280
hear sometimes people saying a false

425
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:56,080
positive rate or an alpha level of 0.05

426
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,880
as being one that's an acceptable uh

427
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,480
false positive rate for a single

428
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,919
experiment and this means that if there

429
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,600
is no association between your trait and

430
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,360
your

431
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,480
outcome um if you were to go let's say

432
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,280
and Sample po um uh group uh create

433
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
samples in your population many

434
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,440
different samples of this particular

435
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,640
variant so maybe perform any gws in many

436
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,919
different groups of the people then

437
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:27,120
about 5% of these tests would have a P

438
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:29,320
value um less than 05 so so just due to

439
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,600
sampling variability and just Rand

440
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:36,080
Randomness you're going to get

441
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,559
some um results that have P value less

442
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,960
than your threshold of of determining

443
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,559
something is important but the problem

444
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,039
with genomite Association studies is

445
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,760
that multiple tests when multiple tests

446
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,520
are performed the probability of having

447
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,000
at least one false positive is greater

448
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,039
than Alpha it's just like a a numerical

449
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,640
fact if you work it all out so in we're

450
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,919
not doing a test of a single genetic

451
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,720
variant we're doing a test of millions

452
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,520
or hundreds of millions of of genetic

453
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,320
variants in this one sample that you

454
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,280
have for your genomite Association study

455
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,320
so to um um maintain an overall false

456
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,200
false positive rate of 05 you have to

457
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,080
adjust this threshold of that you're

458
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,640
going to um see uh decide is uh

459
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,000
sufficient for you to call something

460
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,600
statistically significant um and it's

461
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,640
based on the number of independent tests

462
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,880
being performed um so so in you know we

463
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,600
have this Bon Fon method for correcting

464
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,080
P values or adjusting adjusting a

465
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,400
familywise error rates in an experiment

466
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,200
where you're be looking at more than

467
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,520
just one single statistical test um

468
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,640
where you take your overall false

469
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,960
positive rate and divided by the number

470
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,480
of tests now there are um there's a lot

471
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,880
of early literature around on what

472
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,679
should this P value be in the case of

473
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:05,120
genom Association studies and um the the

474
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:09,840
field settled on this this number of 5

475
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,640
time 10us 8 which uh can be obtained in

476
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,159
a couple different ways but based on the

477
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,679
the array the genotyping array

478
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,880
technology available at that time um and

479
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,320
um correlation link equilibrium which is

480
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,159
another population genetics term um that

481
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,440
exists in the human in the the most

482
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,600
likely sample that were that that were

483
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,000
being studying at that time there were

484
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:41,320
about a million independent um regions

485
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,080
of the genome so 05 divided by a million

486
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,480
you get something around five time 10

487
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,679
minus 8 so this is one of the origin

488
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,480
stories of that significance threshold

489
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:54,679
for genomite Association studies which

490
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,840
is um commonly used these days um more

491
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:00,320
um in more

492
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:04,320
modern more recently um there have been

493
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:07,080
other methods of obtaining statistical

494
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,679
significance thresholds and sometimes

495
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,720
for a gen and white Association study

496
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,960
you'll see something like around 10

497
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,080
Theus 9 or 10us 11 10us 12 all justified

498
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,919
by trying to estimate the number of

499
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,000
independent tests being performed in at

500
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,200
in a large scale genomite Association

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,720
study we have a a quick question on line

502
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,880
um could we calculate the risk ratio

503
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,039
instead of the odds

504
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,200
ratio that's a great question um so

505
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:42,840
going back to the model for um a case

506
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,919
control study um I would say that we uh

507
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,520
sometimes a risk ratio could be a more

508
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,480
appropriate measure of

509
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,159
Association um but uh since we're using

510
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,039
a regression framework perhaps it's

511
00:23:52,159 --> 00:24:00,240
easier to obtain an odds ratio from a

512
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:02,400
regression um uh the the uh the whole

513
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,440
the way that this whole formula works

514
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,000
out and you want to get to a a measure

515
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,120
of risk in the case of a binary outcome

516
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
you take that um the regression

517
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,240
coefficient for the snip the beta you um

518
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,039
and use it as a ex it's e to that beta

519
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,600
equals an odds ratio just

520
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,799
mathematically uh so I would say that in

521
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,679
genomite association studies we use odds

522
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,840
ratio because of the ease of calculating

523
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:34,080
it from the the regression a logistic

524
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,159
regression um it's a good point because

525
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,159
if you're studying common diseases in

526
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,880
epidemiology you learn that perhaps an

527
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,240
onth ratio is not going to be a good

528
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,440
approximation for a risk ratio so it's

529
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,520
it's a good point to keep in mind I have

530
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,760
another question you can use the

531
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,840
microphone yeah um from the previous

532
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,799
slide when you have the regression

533
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,600
equation set up yeah so is um is the

534
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,399
goal of the study to discover like these

535
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,000
beta values so would that be done

536
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:02,799
through a grid search or do we is it

537
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,480
just the beta for this snip so the the

538
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:11,760
solution to um I would say that it's a

539
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:14,799
it's a um standard solution for us

540
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,240
solving leg uh like linear regression

541
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,640
which is is not a grid search there's

542
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,039
actually a numerical solution okay um so

543
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,840
it's not a machine learning approach

544
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,720
this just kind of a um there's a a set

545
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,520
of formulas that would be used um to

546
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,399
obtain the estimate from the sample and

547
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,200
then the many many extensions that go

548
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:33,919
off from this it's it gets more

549
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,279
complicated but that's the gist of it

550
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,039
it's it's basically calculated from the

551
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,520
observations in your

552
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:43,039
sample um and uh it's there's a lot of

553
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,279
literature if you want to learn more

554
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,080
about how the regression estimates are

555
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,159
obtained in a multiple linear setting

556
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,640
okay and is y is it like we're finding

557
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,440
all of these betas or just the actually

558
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,200
fit the whole model for every snip and

559
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,960
uh sometimes if your model is really

560
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,159
complicated and this is why we have to

561
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,600
use more modern techniques it can take

562
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,360
several seconds to or like half a second

563
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,520
to actually get these numbers from from

564
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,600
your um you know the the data you have

565
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,279
and so when you're doing a million or

566
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,000
100 million or 500 million um Snips um

567
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,399
it can take a really long time so there

568
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,720
are now a number of techniques that

569
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:26,520
speed up these calculations your

570
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,039
estimations but I really not going to

571
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,919
get into that for the primer thank you

572
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,880
oh

573
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:37,799
sure all right so let's dive let's let's

574
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,399
get into some of these other can we move

575
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,080
quickly through some of these so I

576
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,399
talked about the genom significance

577
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,760
threshold traditionally being 5 time 10

578
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:49,200
minus

579
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,159
8 I'm going to get into describing well

580
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,600
here this is a depiction of a Manhattan

581
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:58,480
plot which uh um we often see for genom

582
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:01,640
white Association studies where a um

583
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:06,279
every point is a snip that's tested and

584
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,279
um on the Y AIS um we transform the P

585
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:12,640
value of that snip by taking a the

586
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,600
negative value of log 10 of that P and

587
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
you know that there's no reason why it's

588
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,640
this and not something else it's just

589
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:23,360
that uh we want a way to let uh variants

590
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:27,279
that have low P values be you know seen

591
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,799
easily so this this um transformation

592
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:33,720
has just was applied and has worked

593
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:37,720
really well for us um so you have this

594
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:41,799
early type two diabetes um um GW you

595
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,679
have a a region on chromosome 10 which

596
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:45,919
had where you see a number of genetic

597
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,919
variants with low P values these are all

598
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,799
in the same Locust they're correlated

599
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,799
with linkage distin liberium in in that

600
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:57,360
area which is I think I said earlier a

601
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,679
population genetics term um but you can

602
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,559
see how

603
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,720
the um the places of statistical

604
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,519
significance Rise Above the Rest that

605
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,279
they look like the skyline of

606
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,799
Manhattan um we use quantile quantile

607
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,399
plots or QQ plots to um look at the

608
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,559
results of a genomite Association

609
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:18,320
studies to make sure that the underlying

610
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:21,279
model is good and that confounding is

611
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,880
well controlled um this is because that

612
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,919
under the null hypothesis um there is an

613
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,880
uh we we expect the uh so when there are

614
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,919
no association between a variant and

615
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,080
your outcome um we expect the kind of

616
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,519
the points in the quantal quantal plot

617
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,480
to follow the x equals y line here just

618
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,880
the way we've constructed it um I would

619
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,519
say nowadays we we've have very well

620
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
powerered genomite Association studies

621
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:51,279
so this was from the early days when we

622
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,679
did not have well-powered and by powered

623
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,600
I mean um statistical power or ability

624
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,679
to detect associations due to having a

625
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,519
large enough sample size

626
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,760
um which I'll I might get into a little

627
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,640
bit um finally um The genome well not

628
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,760
finally this is is kind of wrapping up

629
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,760
some of the the primer like the really

630
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,600
basic Tech um terms that we use um the

631
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,120
genetic variants that we're studying um

632
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,240
we we we don't really uh know if they

633
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:26,640
are the ones that are causing the

634
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,640
association between um our uh the um

635
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,600
whatever causing whatever

636
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,960
um I guess biological or physiological

637
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,600
change that impacts the your outcome of

638
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,000
your

639
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,960
phenotype um and back in the early days

640
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,159
of genom Association studies we were

641
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,399
using genotyping arrays which were

642
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,440
pre-made products that read out the

643
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:50,600
genotype of a particular individual at

644
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,720
all these different set locations and so

645
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:57,399
um maybe it was more like this uh the

646
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,200
the situation where the the red places

647
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:01,880
on along this strand of DNA were what we

648
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,080
actually had available to us in our

649
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,559
genotyping array

650
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:11,120
data um but the true Association here

651
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,039
which is kind of this blue bar or dot

652
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,039
figure

653
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,519
thing uh was the the causal variant but

654
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,080
it wasn't included in our genotyping

655
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,000
array uh thanks to a um technique called

656
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,399
imputation where we can leverage

657
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,840
sequencing data in populations to kind

658
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:29,240
of fill in the Gap because humans share

659
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,120
this you know very very very high

660
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,679
percentage of of the their genetic

661
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,799
sequence um we we didn't so before we

662
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,320
used had this imputation techniques

663
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,720
available to us we just had what was

664
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,880
available on the geny raay which meant

665
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,039
that we might that most likely weren't

666
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,440
being we were not observing any causal

667
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,440
variance so or or the causal variance at

668
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,320
a location

669
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,399
um and and the the reason it worked is

670
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,240
because of this this equilibrium which

671
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,919
is the

672
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:07,480
correlation um between observed alals

673
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:11,919
that are just present due to um the the

674
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,080
changes of of alal frequencies in human

675
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,039
populations we have a quick question on

676
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,480
the previous slide could you touch on

677
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:23,120
inflation in uh the Lambda looking at

678
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,120
the QQ plot um I would so and how to

679
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,000
interpret well I I think that may be a

680
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,639
little more than I want to get into

681
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,240
during the primer but I would say that

682
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:37,320
if you're studying in the context of you

683
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,880
know my Association studies if you

684
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,000
um look at the you know you can study

685
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,480
the distribution of all the variants um

686
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,159
in this in this way and you can of

687
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,399
measure

688
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:53,960
using a metric called the genomic

689
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,240
control measure which uh is the median

690
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,080
test statistic producing that that would

691
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,960
be somewhere in this this this

692
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,679
distribution you compare the observed

693
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,279
median test statistic to the OBS

694
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,000
expected median test statistic and that

695
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,360
basically says you know down in this

696
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,919
part of the

697
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,240
distribution um where you find the

698
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,159
median um that the observed median is

699
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:23,919
larger or smaller uh than what you would

700
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:27,360
expect um and that's just a key uh uh

701
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:31,320
that's a um IND indication that there

702
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,679
could be some modeling issues um some

703
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,240
undetected confounding in your um

704
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,559
analysis and that you should go back and

705
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,600
revisit often or traditionally it's been

706
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:44,519
population structure the need for um

707
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,440
controlling for differ in the Leal

708
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,639
frequencies and subpopulations in your

709
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,240
sample that um could be corrected

710
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:53,519
through the use of genetic principal

711
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,399
components but there are other uh

712
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,799
reasons um that could change that that

713
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,000
could lead you to do it different type

714
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,000
of

715
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,960
modeling all right so um we we have have

716
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,760
depicted here a regional plot which is a

717
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,440
zoomed in version of The Manhattan plot

718
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,720
and for most U genomite Association

719
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,720
studies there'll be Loi where there's an

720
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,039
association the authors of the study

721
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,840
want to say something about those

722
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,720
regions so they'll use a a regional plot

723
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,480
that depicts um U the um linkous

724
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,480
equilibrium stati ICS between your more

725
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,000
here I'll use my mouse like the index

726
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,960
variant this is the variant that has the

727
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,279
lowest B value or that you are the most

728
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,039
interested in and you can kind of uh

729
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,799
calculate pairwise link with all the

730
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,799
other variants and then put them on a

731
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,039
plot so it's it's it's a useful type of

732
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,960
depiction next primer if you're going to

733
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:53,679
be studying learning about eqtls the

734
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,360
idea of things at the regional level

735
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,360
will become really

736
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,120
important um finally here well finally

737
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:05,159
in this whole I think yeah we're gonna

738
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,720
go into a couple different themes next

739
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,879
um I'll cont I wanted to contrast the

740
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,320
observed genetic architecture of common

741
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,480
diseases and biomedical traits um this

742
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,040
is from a uh review in nature review

743
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,200
genetics from 2018 called genetic

744
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,040
architecture the shape of the genetic

745
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,480
contribution to human traits and

746
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:31,280
diseases um H so on the leftand plot

747
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,599
I've showing you the the I'm sharing the

748
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,079
um genetic architecture of type 1

749
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,800
diabetes versus type two diabetes um

750
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,800
from known at that time and you'll see

751
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,480
that there are quite a number of

752
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,960
differences in the genetic

753
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,320
architecture um you'll see that there

754
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,240
are a number of low frequency um

755
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,839
variants that are associated with type

756
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,200
one diabetes um there's this point up

757
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,720
here which is a

758
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,200
a frequent variant U that has a very

759
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,760
strong effect on type 1 diabetes

760
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,599
contrast that with a number of low

761
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,560
effect variant across the alal frequency

762
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,599
spectrum I would say that as um the

763
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,920
statistical Power Of Studies have

764
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,839
increased we actually have been able to

765
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,920
fill in a lot of this the variance in

766
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,280
this area for type two

767
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,200
diabetes um on the right hand side we

768
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,480
have vitamin D levels and L

769
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,560
cholesterol um you know here showcasing

770
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,800
that vitamin D level maybe it's a less

771
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:39,839
heritable trait there are fewer variants

772
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,720
associated with vitamin D level I used

773
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,240
in this

774
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,920
particular figure um and a number and

775
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,800
many more associated with LDL

776
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,440
cholesterol so a trait that you're

777
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:55,000
studying could have any any sort of

778
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,880
genetic architecture um you might have a

779
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,400
hypothesis about what the genetic archit

780
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,319
architecture is but um I would say the

781
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,040
the purpose of further genomite

782
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:06,119
Association studies on all these

783
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,079
different traits and outcomes is to

784
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,640
really kind of Define the Gen genetic

785
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:14,200
architecture of that

786
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,200
trait are there any

787
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:25,319
questions all right so I'm going to dive

788
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:29,960
into some some examples um back in

789
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:33,440
2010 um the there became this this sort

790
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,960
of celebratory depiction of of all the

791
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,440
genomewide association studies that were

792
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,480
discovered because um it was a little

793
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,040
slow goinging in the beginning because

794
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,280
we didn't realize that such that that

795
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,680
statistical power could be as well we

796
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,520
didn't realize that the effects that we

797
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,160
would see out come back here were going

798
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:55,880
to be so low and that the um the the

799
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,680
ability to detect these in a jwi

800
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:03,200
Association study um dependent on the

801
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:06,160
the size the sample size um so back in

802
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,200
2010 you know great we've we celebrating

803
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,200
we found some genetic variants that were

804
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,319
associated with many different types of

805
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,640
traits um in 2014 even better you know

806
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:19,040
it's this is good you know we're gaining

807
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,359
momentum and but in 2019 you know it's

808
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,160
it's saturated so um so many different

809
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:26,280
groups across the world are doing

810
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,880
genomite Association studies on so many

811
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,240
different traits um meta analyses are

812
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,839
coming you know are happening to combine

813
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:42,079
the uh many small samples into a big

814
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:44,400
meta sample and um by this time in 2019

815
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,079
it was pretty well establish that gomite

816
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,880
Association studies were successful and

817
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,880
were a good tool to find the genetic

818
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,359
variance associated with traits and

819
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,040
outcomes I would say it was hay at the

820
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:59,400
beginning around 2010 de there were a

821
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,040
lot of there's a lot of

822
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,440
commentary that um there's a lot of

823
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,760
money being spent on these Juno

824
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,240
Association studies and nothing was

825
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,640
really coming out of them

826
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:15,640
um the small effects are still maybe the

827
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,599
norm um so uh a lot of the things that

828
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:23,760
flow Downstream from genomite

829
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:28,040
Association studies are are now built to

830
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,839
take advantage or uh you use the small

831
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,760
effect genetic variants that are found

832
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,839
um in you

833
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,839
know in in in many different

834
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,920
ways all right so now I'm going to get

835
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,240
into an example of a modern genom

836
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,480
Association study this is a publication

837
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,160
that just came out La uh two or three

838
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,200
months ago um from the um million

839
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,400
veteran the VA million veteran program

840
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:58,040
and um this is

841
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,440
uh this is a group I I know many of

842
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,599
these investigators well and so I was

843
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,000
really happy to see the when when this

844
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,119
this big paper came out a single cohort

845
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,520
whereas often like I said these

846
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:13,880
metaanalyses will be performed to

847
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:16,800
combined many many different uh cohorts

848
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,760
into a single meta analysis but here we

849
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:24,240
have an anal um a depiction of of

850
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,599
2668 traits being studied um in the

851
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,480
million veteran program um and uh

852
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,119
particular analysis uh is important

853
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:39,440
because

854
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:42,079
um the entire spectrum of of uh you know

855
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,319
of diversity within the human or within

856
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,319
the United States I would say um could

857
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:51,480
be better represented in the sample from

858
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:53,800
the veterans program so overall the

859
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,440
number of people contributing this

860
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,040
analysis are six 635,000

861
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:06,280
69 it's just so cool to see

862
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:08,480
this um their particular um you know the

863
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,800
the traits that they're trying to use

864
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,800
the heritable traits that they're using

865
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,359
in this analysis had to do with um fee

866
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,880
codes which are just medical record um

867
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,880
codes uh or outcomes or diseases that

868
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,960
are um derived or um obtained from

869
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,240
medical record data they have laboratory

870
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,040
measures

871
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:35,359
Vital Statistics and then survey

872
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,160
questions so the the type of variable uh

873
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,160
the type yeah the type of variable

874
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:44,280
outcomes being studied here can can vary

875
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,359
and this is a good u a good example of

876
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,119
of a the type of data you can use as

877
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,119
outcomes in a genome Association

878
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,880
study

879
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,079
um let's see they

880
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,200
the um

881
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,760
this is a kind of a depiction of the

882
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,680
traits and the frequency of um of the

883
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,359
binary traits on the left um and the

884
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,440
sample size is available for the um for

885
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:15,079
the quantitative traits on the right and

886
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,880
so here I I guess I would flag that even

887
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,400
in a single sample studying a trait

888
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,400
you're not going to have the same sample

889
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,160
size for every trait because you are

890
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,680
subject to data

891
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,079
availability but it was really cool to

892
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,280
see how there's more than a thousand or

893
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:36,839
10,000 or 100,000 individuals with a

894
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,720
particular condition um being studied

895
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:41,480
here so uh we have

896
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,720
the

897
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,000
um Manhattan plots of their binary trait

898
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,520
results and then their quantitative

899
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,560
trait results um and then the uh on the

900
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,440
right hand side is is the genetic

901
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,319
architecture plot um where uh they've

902
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,599
taken the minor Al so for any variant in

903
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:04,280
the genome the minor Al is defined as

904
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,680
the less frequent Al and and then

905
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:11,200
plotted the effect either the beta in

906
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,480
the case of the um oh yeah flipped these

907
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,560
because I have beta up there and then

908
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,119
odds rati down here so um the the odds

909
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,920
ratio goes up with the binary traits but

910
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:27,280
the point being is that it shows how um

911
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:31,440
you can find common and rare variant

912
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,559
which with large effects on the um on

913
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,680
the uh either the the outcome on the

914
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:39,760
odds ratio scale or a trait um on a

915
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,760
probably some normalized scale here to

916
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,680
put all the traits in the same plot

917
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,280
you'd have to normalize the the the the

918
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:52,839
scale or the the unit of the the

919
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:56,480
betas so I mean you can see here that

920
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:58,119
that variants in that harded de region

921
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,800
are you know are

922
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:03,960
here um and and that really shows the

923
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,960
showcases the power of a genomite

924
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,079
Association

925
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,240
study okay I'm G to wrap up with one

926
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:13,160
more example um uh yeah all right so

927
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,160
this is our toolkit and I've gone over

928
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,800
most of all all of these have a little

929
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,319
plug for some good resources that people

930
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,800
could use um that are up to date a very

931
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:28,440
small vignette is analysis run by a

932
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,160
postdoctoral fellow in my my lab um or

933
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,800
actually she's now been promoted to as

934
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,640
instructor so magdalina svia Gonzalez

935
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,760
ran an analysis to to detangle the

936
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,079
heterogenity of hyperinsulinemia so this

937
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,920
is fasting insulin levels along with my

938
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,079
colleague Miriam udler who's also an

939
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,359
associate member here at the road

940
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,520
Institute and here um I'm G just GNA go

941
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:53,680
skip through some of the basics but our

942
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,720
aim here was to use the genetic approach

943
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,040
to elucidate or explain the mechanisms

944
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,640
that underly the relationship between

945
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,359
insulin concentrations so and

946
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,160
cardiovascular risk so the gist of is we

947
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,280
that there are many reasons for a

948
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,119
fasting insulin to be increased in a

949
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,960
person and we want to understand what

950
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,559
those reasons are and and we took an

951
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,640
approach where we we found a set of

952
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,359
variants ass associated with fasting

953
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,040
insulin we leverage the type 2 diabetes

954
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,520
knowledge portal which is a wonderful

955
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,520
resource that came out of the broad

956
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:33,079
Institute and now a you of a worldwide

957
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,440
success um for curating um the results

958
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:39,280
of associate genetic

959
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,319
analysis um but then we took traits that

960
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,480
were from all these other or we took

961
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:46,760
gwas results from all these other traits

962
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,720
and and we're going to leverage this um

963
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:54,319
concept of plat tropy um to find

964
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,119
similarities of in associations so this

965
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,640
is just a depiction of a heat map

966
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,920
showing the effect

967
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,319
of these we know these Snips are all

968
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,839
associated with type two di with fasting

969
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:07,160
insulin um but now we're looking at what

970
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:09,680
they're the associations are with all

971
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,800
these other traits and we see a place

972
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,880
you know a something that's kind of

973
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,960
different um what I'm highlighting here

974
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,839
is a particular variant which um has an

975
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,000
association with triglycerides level um

976
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:26,200
and a bunch of other traits but in an

977
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
unexpected pattern so most all the other

978
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,640
snips if they're associated with

979
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,359
triglycerides might have been a you know

980
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,240
associated with increased triglycerides

981
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,079
but this particular snip is associated

982
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,079
with decreased

983
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,800
triglycerides and Pat tropy is is

984
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:48,359
defined as a an observation of a

985
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,480
particular variant being associated with

986
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:51,960
many different

987
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,920
traits um and then there's a whole field

988
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,440
of of trying to understand how how that

989
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,160
works if it's one trait affecting

990
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,480
you know many traits or if the variant

991
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,760
through different mechanisms are

992
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,720
associated with these different traits

993
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,520
here our hypothesis is that there may be

994
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,720
a common mechanism so another set of

995
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:14,040
variants who with we found having some

996
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,079
pattern of associations across many

997
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,319
different traits we found that very

998
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:23,760
interesting and so we we're using this

999
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:25,160
as a a starting point for a more um

1000
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,440
in-depth

1001
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,960
analysis all right

1002
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,280
so so I'm going to stop here because I

1003
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,319
and we have a time for a few

1004
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,359
questions and um I think then we'd wrap

1005
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:41,119
up around 9:25 between 9:30 and then

1006
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:42,720
people can go over to the MBT lecture hi

1007
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,079
thank you so much um I was wondering is

1008
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,440
it possible to bring um gwas approach to

1009
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,359
bear on larger mutational events like

1010
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,440
structural variants and if so how would

1011
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,640
you do that so that that is an extension

1012
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,520
of gomide Association studies where um

1013
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,720
you would want to have a cohort multiple

1014
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,880
coant where structural variants were the

1015
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,880
alals um that were being studied so

1016
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,040
structural variants are defined as um

1017
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,520
insertions or deletions in the human

1018
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,960
genome that are greater than 50 um base

1019
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,440
pairs long so as I was mentioning

1020
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,640
earlier in this talk that we have now

1021
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:22,359
the ability to see these insertion and

1022
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:26,160
deletions as um uh alals in our um in

1023
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:29,079
our sequence um there's also now uh some

1024
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,960
techniques um getting better every year

1025
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:34,599
I think this is an area of really rapid

1026
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,359
development in human genetics um to to

1027
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:40,400
look for large scale uh genetic

1028
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,040
variation and so um in the case that you

1029
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,480
have a data set where you have

1030
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,319
structural variant calls in a cohort you

1031
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,200
can perform a genomite Association study

1032
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:51,200
just like um that I've shown here so you

1033
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,440
just you're just starting with a

1034
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,520
different sort of alals but the real

1035
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,800
challenge in the field right now is

1036
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:01,440
getting these structural variant

1037
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:04,040
um that uh created using the available

1038
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,640
genetic data that you have in a sample

1039
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,559
and there are a lot of nuances about

1040
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:11,480
that um having to do with the the um

1041
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:16,400
kind of the technique that uh we use

1042
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:19,040
typically to get from a person's DNA

1043
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,520
sample cut we cut it up into tiny little

1044
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,559
pieces and then there's a you know a

1045
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,119
process through which the the genotypes

1046
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:29,440
are read out and so so that process of

1047
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:33,319
cutting up the DNA uh interferes with

1048
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,359
the detection of large scale changes um

1049
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:38,839
so at a very small scale there there's

1050
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:41,000
these long read sequencing techniques

1051
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:43,960
that are being employed and hopefully

1052
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,240
there'll be some impr um new methods and

1053
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,319
new approaches that will allow um many

1054
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,040
different cohorts that have student

1055
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:54,480
typing data to leverage kind of the

1056
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,280
maybe a reference panel of this this

1057
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,640
long read sequencing to to kind of

1058
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,119
impute

1059
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:05,640
the long read read type structural

1060
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:07,839
variance in their cohorts so just a it

1061
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,400
an exciting extension to genomite

1062
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,960
Association studies hello uh so one term

1063
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,160
that I see often in ja literature is the

1064
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,680
liability scale I wonder if you could

1065
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,319
like comment on the idea behind

1066
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,559
converting a trade value to the

1067
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,559
liability scale I I

1068
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:31,000
think it's a I thought about putting

1069
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:36,400
something like this uh in the

1070
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,520
heritability piece um uh because um you

1071
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,520
can technically only calculate

1072
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,760
heritability of a binary trait on a

1073
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,680
liability scale um I I think it's it's

1074
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,440
more slightly more advanced concept but

1075
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,200
a

1076
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,280
liability

1077
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,280
um uh the the concept behind liability

1078
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,559
uh U assumes that there's some

1079
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,240
underlying distribution

1080
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:02,799
above which when a threshold a person's

1081
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,280
value for that whatever whatever

1082
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:06,720
underlying trait passes some threshold

1083
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,359
and they're going to be diseased or

1084
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,599
there's a pathologic like there's a

1085
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:16,440
there's a consequence and so there's a

1086
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:18,040
lot of statistical um work to to explain

1087
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,280
this so I'm not not going to do a very

1088
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:25,119
good job on the Fly um the books that I

1089
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,520
actually uh have you know used as

1090
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,359
references have much better detail

1091
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,640
explanation

1092
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:35,079
um there's more to be

1093
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,440
said about and and it really has to do

1094
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:40,880
with the underlying model like the

1095
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,680
assumptions that between um of how how

1096
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,400
you get to this uh you know disease

1097
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,400
status and what underlying how you can

1098
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,839
measure the underlying causes um which

1099
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,839
are typically unknown
