1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,920
Uh our special guest today is Dr. Ellen

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,200
Stoofan, under secretary for science and

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,759
research at the Smithsonian Institution.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,719
Uh the lecture is made possible by a

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,960
bequest of the late Major Lester

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,560
Gardner, a member of the MIT class of

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
1898.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,640
Uh the lecturesship is earmarked for

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,519
annual presentations on aeronautical

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,760
history. Obviously, it's been broadened

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,599
since then. Over the years, we've been

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
honored by luminaries in the field,

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,800
including Igor Sikosski, Jimmy Doodel,

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,719
Von Brill, and Neil Armstrong. Recent

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,399
speakers were Gwen Shotwell, and Charles

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,120
Balden.

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,239
A remarkable individual, Major Gardner

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,239
played not one but two critical roles in

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,640
the advancement of aviation in the early

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,719
years of the 20th century. First with

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
the encouragement of Grover Loning and

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,559
Jerome Hunac and Glenn Martin, Major

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,440
Gardner organized the Gardener

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,079
Publishing Company publishing aviation

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,960
who's who in American aeronautics the

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,799
rubber age and later aviation

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,520
aeronautical engineering which was the

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,400
predecessor of aviation week which many

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,320
of us like to read. In addition, Major

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,720
Gardner was among the founders of the

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
Institute of Aeronautical Sciences,

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,040
which later became the Institute of

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,680
Aerospace Sciences, which was one of the

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,560
progenitors of the American Institute of

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,240
Aeronautics and Astronautics, AIAA,

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,720
which is the professional society

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,439
associated with the field. An air

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,840
officer in World War I, Major Gardner

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,000
was a recipient of numerous aeronautical

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,000
awards, including the Daniel Guggenheim

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
Medal in 1947,

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
given for outstanding achievement in

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,400
advancing aeronautics, particularly for

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,680
his conception organization, Institute

45
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,360
for Aeronautical Sciences. With this as

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
background, let's turn our attention to

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,240
our speaker today, Dr. Ellen Stoofan,

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,960
Under Secretary for Science and Research

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,880
at the Smithsonian Institution. uh in

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,680
which job she oversees the science

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,360

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,040
administration, planetary science. Dr.

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,200
Stove has focused on the Smithsonian's

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
collective scientific initiatives,

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,520
commitment to research, addressing

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
current issues such as biodiversity,

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
climate change, global health, search

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,720
for life in our solar system beyond. As

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,040
the former chief scientist of NASA, Dr.

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,599

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,640
humans to Mars and developing strategies

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,160
for NASA to support commercial activity

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,680
in LEO. She hold masters she holds

NASA student service medal and the

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,239
explorers club lol Thomas award. Without

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,920
further ado, uh allow me to welcome Dr.

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,879
Ellen Stoofan the 2021 Lester D. Gardner

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,560
lecture. Let me turn it over to you.

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,159
>> Thank you uh so much and uh it is such

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
an honor to be here and of course all

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,440
those things at NASA I I did only with

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,599
the permission of my uh boss Dr. Newman

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,840
here. Uh let's see.

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,239
I was just saying after years of a year

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,560
of Zoom, I can actually share my screen.

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,519
Okay. As I said, um you know, thank you.

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,000
It's such an honor to be here today. Um

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,000
and I I thought that um given the um

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
excitement at least in the planetary

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
science community certainly but I think

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,159
in the broader community also um going

96
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
on of the last month's landing of the

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,400
Perseverance lander and the about to be

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,319
flight of um Ingenuity which uh uh uh

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,599
Dava has right behind her there. She

100
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,959
joined me on Mars. Um, you know, I

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
thought it would be interesting to

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,239
really talk about this issue of

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,720
exploring planetary surfaces with robots

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,280
and humans. Um, for those who are close

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,759
to the space program, you know that

106
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,240
oftentimes there's been a discussion as

107
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
though uh robotic exploration of the

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,759
solar system and human exploration of

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,240
the solar system are two things that are

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,639
opposed to each other or in conflict.

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Why do we need to send humans? Um

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,479
there's always been um especially there

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
has been a thread in the planetary

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,040
science community sort of oh anti- um

115
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,960
human exploration. Um and I think we've

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,720
moved beyond that. But I think it's

117
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,919
really interesting to step really far

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,680
back and look at the at how we explore

119
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
planetary surfaces. And I'm going to go

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,240
through a couple different examples

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,919
today and how we use different

122
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,639
technologies

123
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,479
um to get the science that we need. And

124
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,320
I'm just going to argue that humans are

125
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,759
actually just one of those technologies,

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,720
one of those skill sets that are

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,000
available to us as we try to answer uh

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,680
really big scientific questions.

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,400
I also um have to apologize that I have

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,039
a hard cut off um right at 3:00 because

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,479
I have to go um give another talk. So I

132
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,840
want to apologize, but I'm going to try

133
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,759
to um finish well in advance to a answer

134
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
uh questions.

135
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
I thought it would be interesting to

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
start with um this slide which is

137
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,440
actually an artist rendition of the

138
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,080
exoplanet some of the exoplanets that

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,840
were discovered by the Kepler mission

140
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,720
because today I'm really going to focus

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,960
on solar system exploration but one of

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,360
the things I really want to emphasize is

143
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,440
is the fact that we've discovered these

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,199
uh thousands of exoplanets obviously

145
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
with with the recent numbers really

146
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,919
jumping up with the results from the

147
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,400
transiting exoplanet survey satellite

148
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,960
that this is putting our solar system

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,120
into a much needed and much broader

150
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,280
context. I think this makes this whole

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
question of how we explore planetary

152
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,680
surfaces interesting especially as we

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,919
move into the era of the James Web Space

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,319
Telescope as we think about larger and

155
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,759
larger telescopes. We're going to be

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,639
starting to use um astro astro

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,080
astronomical techniques to do planetary

158
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,520
science, which of course we did in the

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,199
beginning of planetary science. And

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,759
we'll be circling back around to that

161
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
again as we start really trying to get

162
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,880
at exoplanets. How earthlike are they?

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,360
What are the processes that that we see

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,880
uh taking place? Um

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,919
okay,

166
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,039
there we go. Um okay, but back to our

167
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,280
solar system. So obviously it's been 60

168
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,479
years that we've been um exploring our

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,280
solar system and during that time

170
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,960
obviously NASA has amazingly been able

171
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,039
to visit and in many cases revisit all

172
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,800
of the bodies in our own solar system

173
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,360
and given that I'm talking with Alan

174
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,759
Stern in my next uh appointment after

175
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,479
this one I have to mention of course um

176
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,360
including Pluto or quiper belt objects

177
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,520
we have also explored um beyond just the

178
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
major planets of our solar system and of

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
course series and comets and asteroids.

180
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,400
So, a really comprehensive exploration

181
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,479
and I'll be pointing out in a couple

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,800
different places this has actually

183
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:29,280
really differed from the uh exploration

184
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,160
plans and approaches that have been used

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,919
by other countries. Um, and I'll be

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,400
talking about Venus and Mars today.

187
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,240
Obviously, those were um the planets

188
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,360
that were most studied by the then

189
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,520
Soviet Union, now Russia. um which to

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,400
chose to rather than do sort of the

191
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,400
expansive uh reconnaissance of the solar

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,720
system that the United States did in

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,639
instead chose to focus on on just a few

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,319
bodies.

195
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,280
But I'm also going to argue that as

196
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,680
we've gone out and tried to answer

197
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,479
scientific questions, it's been a

198
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,599
function of of both what technologies do

199
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,319
we have available to us um to go and

200
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,039
answer scientific questions and then of

201
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,360
course how much funding is available to

202
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
actually go ahead and implement those

203
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,720
missions because obviously as a

204
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,960
scientist if we had all the money in the

205
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,800
world I would be everywhere with some of

206
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
the most advanced techniques. possible,

207
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
but there's only so much money.

208
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
Technology is only ever at a certain

209
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,719
state. So, we balance those things and

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,320
come up with priorities. And this has

211
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,320
now been uh as most of you know um put

212
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
into routine through the national

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,519
academyy's decadal surveys which lays

214
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,600
out uh 10-year plan recommendations that

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,800
they give to NASA and NASA balances

216
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,279
those recommendations against its budget

217
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,680
and and sets out priorities of what

218
00:08:51,279 --> 00:09:00,000
exploration uh can be accomplished.

219
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,800
And as we bring in human exploration,

220
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,320
that brings in way other motivations for

221
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,880
why we explore. Um my uh many of us are

222
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,720
are good friends with um John Grunfeld

223
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
and he put it I think better than most

224
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,320
people have. Um he would say we would

225
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
explore for fear, greed, and knowledge.

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,200
And the knowledge part is the the part

227
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm going to focus on today. Um the fear

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,720
part he he said was the uh the

229
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,680
geopolitical you know we're trying to

230
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,160
we're trying to show uh superiority as

231
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,480
we did in Apollo in the cold war to say

232
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,880
we have technological superiority. So

233
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,800
that's sort of the fear. Um greed is

234
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,800
obviously the era that we're moving into

235
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,440
right now. Are there actually commercial

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,120
reasons that drive exploration forward?

237
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,160
I think many of us feel it's a little

238
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,480
early for that. Um but but still that is

239
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,279
a motivator for why we might move into

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,279
the solar system. Um and and then

241
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,040
there's the whole inspiration piece. But

242
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,800
today I'm really going to focus on what

243
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,959
drives us forward in a scientific sense

244
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,600
and how do those questions become more

245
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,680
complex as we move and we learn which

246
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
then modifies the questions and then

247
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,000
again we have to have technology and

248
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,360
funding um catch up to allow us to

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,640
actually implement those plans. Um,

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,640
let's see.

251
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,560
I also want to point out that one of the

252
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,519
things we've certainly learned as um as

253
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,399
we've gained more and more knowledge um

254
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,920
and as we've been able as I I said said

255
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,440
in the first slide showing the Kepler

256
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,279
exoplanets

257
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,600
um that we always have to be really

258
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,079
cautious as we frame questions and move

259
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,320
outward because we

260
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
not only live in a single solar system

261
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
that we now know differs greatly from

262
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,680
many many of the solar systems we've

263
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,200
been able to observe but we're also

264
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,320
exploring our solar system at a point in

265
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,120
time and I really have loved this slide

266
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,600
that Don Brownley put together um

267
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,839
because all of these are the earth you

268
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,800
have the early earth with a magma ocean

269
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,519
you have the blue earth dominated by by

270
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,839
seno bacteria you have ice covered

271
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,480
snowball earth so you really have to

272
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,360
think we're not only investigating our

273
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,440
solar system as a unique place in the

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,560
universe, we're actually also getting it

275
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,040
at a certain point in time. And so as we

276
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,079
frame scientific questions, we have to

277
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,160
be really thoughtful about the fact um

278
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,399
that the time in which we are exploring

279
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,240
it is is not representative of the

280
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,320
entire history of that solar system. And

281
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,880
that obviously becomes really critical

282
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,519
as we go to places like Venus and Mars

283
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,120
that we know have gone like the Earth

284
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,640
through pretty radical changes

285
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,399
throughout their history. And so when

286
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,399
we're trying to answer scientific

287
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,320
questions, a lot of the times we're

288
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,839
trying to grab an understanding of

289
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,279
something that happened billions of

290
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,920
years before and therefore those

291
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,839
questions are quite hard to answer. Um

292
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,200
this is another reason why I'm so

293
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
excited. You know, most people are

294
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,160
looking for that blue planet Earth 2.0.

295
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,160
I want to find that really cool magma

296
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,920
ocean planet because you know my whole

297
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,279
career people are like oh yeah the magma

298
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,800
ocean planet and then we do this and

299
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,360
you're like can we go back to that magma

300
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,000
ocean planet really cool and the thought

301
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
that with as we develop more and more

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,519
powerful telescopes we're going to

303
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,480
actually be able to study examples of

304
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,720
these around our galaxy I think in other

305
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,720
solar systems I think is incredibly

306
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,720
exciting.

307
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
I thought it would be interesting and

308
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,519
obviously this is something we all know

309
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,519
quite well as we think about this

310
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,920
question of when do we use robots? How

311
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,560
do we change how we explore a planet

312
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,000
historically? How do we decide when to

313
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,360
go to do humans to go through how we

314
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,240
normally and how historically we have

315
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,240
explored the solar system? As all of you

316
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,880
well know, we started with flyby

317
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,839
missions. Whether it's a Pioneer, a

318
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,440
Mariner, a Voyager, uh those are the

319
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,120
easiest technologically. That's

320
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
certainly why we started out with them.

321
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
To get into orbit around a body is hard.

322
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,160
It was a technology we didn't have. So,

323
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,360
we started with flybys. or we were

324
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,279
trying to do something like the

325
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,200
reconnaissance of the outer solar

326
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,279
system, the Grand Tour mission, where we

327
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,519
know because of a unique lineup of the

328
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,600
planets with Voyager that we could grab

329
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,399
a whole bunch of planetary systems out

330
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,000
in the outer solar system with one um

331
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,839
mission, one mission, two spacecraft.

332
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,240
So, we choose a flyby mission partially

333
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
because it was a technology reason, but

334
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
then partially because it's

335
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,480
reconnaissance. It's easy to do. It

336
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,560
might suit a specific situation. But

337
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,360
then pretty quickly we want to get into

338
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,720
orbit. Why do we want to get into orbit?

339
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,120
Obviously sustained look at a planetary

340
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
surface, much better knowledge of the

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,959
gravity field so that we can understand

342
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
the interior of a planet uh and

343
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,639
obviously looking at change over a

344
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,519
planet with time. We get that global

345
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,760
view, the global data sets that then

346
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,760
actually help us figure out if we want

347
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,160
to land on the surface, where are we

348
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,839
going to go? because we only can land in

349
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
one place normally and we want to make

350
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,360
sure if we're spending all this money

351
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,639
that we're landing in the right place.

352
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,959
So using an orbiter we gather huge data

353
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,480
sets to try to understand where best to

354
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,720
land on a planetary surface. Um first

355
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,040
steps are always a robotic lander

356
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,000
usually without mobility because they're

357
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,160
easier to do. um you have a specific set

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,160
of tech of scientific questions usually

359
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,199
a combination of measurements of an

360
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,760
atmosphere if there is one a surface um

361
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,680
trying to understand the basic chemistry

362
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,839
uh is normally how we stand out all the

363
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,560
way to more simpler static landers like

364
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,240
an insight lander on Mars um that's

365
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,000
trying to answer a really specific

366
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,079
question for which you need a static

367
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,920
lander you have a seismometer you want

368
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,399
to go you want to sit on the surface you

369
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,880
don't want to move um so you go back to

370
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,279
that static lander

371
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,519
But as your questions become more

372
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,320
complex, as you understand the geology

373
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,519
of a surface, being in one place is not

374
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,519
good enough. You need mobility. Uh and

375
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,920
then your choice of mobility obviously

376
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,680
depends on your destination.

377
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,320
uh whether it's ground mobility or

378
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,800
aerial mobility and that is also driven

379
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
by the geology because if you go to a

380
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,560
place and I'll come back to this in a

381
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,000
minute as we go to Venus if your

382
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,399
geologic units are tens to hundreds of

383
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,920
kilometers across a rover is really

384
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,440
difficult because you're going to have

385
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,040
to go really far distances um before you

386
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
actually get to answer the questions

387
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,399
you're trying to answer. So in a case

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,160
like that, you really want aerial

389
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,079
mobility where you can get from point A

390
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,120
to point B and they're far apart much

391
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,639
more rapidly. Sample return is usually

392
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,279
obviously the next if it's

393
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,440
technologically feasible because as you

394
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,920
well know we can't repeat uh ground

395
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,920
laboratories um on a planet. We can do

396
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,839
really well. Um but the best

397
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,560
laboratories are still located here on

398
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,560
this planet. and then a human lander.

399
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,959
And whether your human is the vehicle

400
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,160
for sample return as it was with with

401
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,160
Apollo or whether humans are are are

402
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,560
doing a function beyond that is is

403
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,079
something uh we can discuss. And

404
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,839
obviously the moon is going to be the

405
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,160
typical sequence of how this happened.

406
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,040
It started with flybys, both pioneer and

407
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,880
luna missions, impactors in the case of

408
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,759
the moon because that was an easy thing

409
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,560
to do and get you some good data. um

410
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,399
Luna, the Rangers, the Surveyor program.

411
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Russians called all their ma missions

412
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,680
Luna. So pretty much you say Luna, you

413
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
you're talking about one of these

414
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,600
missions. And then obviously surface

415
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,040
mobility, uh robotic in the case of the

416
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,880
Luna missions with the Luna, uh and S

417
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,360
then sample return with one of the later

418
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,920
Luna missions and obviously the the US

419
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,680
went to to surface mobility and sample

420
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,320
return with humans um during the Apollo

421
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
mission.

422
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Uh and just to iterate again, even

423
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,360
though science was not driving the

424
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,839
Apollo program by any stretch of the

425
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,640
imagination, um it was definitely

426
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,799
geopolitical conflict as we all know.

427
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,600
Nevertheless, you still had to follow

428
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,760
that similar sequence of exploration

429
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,120
because you needed the knowledge in

430
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,199
order to be able to conduct uh safe uh

431
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,199
human operations. So you were not going

432
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,880
to be able to land on the surface and

433
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,600
move around unless you had had flyby

434
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,440
missions, orbiters, landers, this

435
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,039
sequence because you needed to gain the

436
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,280
knowledge to understand that it was

437
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,120
actually safe to conduct human

438
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,720
operations. So those surveyor missions

439
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,520
were really critical in understanding

440
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,840
the surface density, understanding safe

441
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,200
landing sites for Apollo. And so that

442
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,480
same sequence of um of exploration and

443
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,480
actually in this case um you there was

444
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,400
amazing science that came out of it. It

445
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
wasn't driven by the science but you

446
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,360
needed the knowledge to actually help

447
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,480
move the technology forward uh to get to

448
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,280
where we need to go. And that sequence

449
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,799
especially I think Apollo also really

450
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,000
illustrates

451
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,799
um that it's technology ready readiness

452
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,600
driven right we also started with simple

453
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,600
missions the missions got more complex

454
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,080
uh we learned to land on a planetary

455
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,400
surface we learned to take back off of a

456
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,640
planetary surface and we couldn't do

457
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,799
those things until we had developed the

458
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
technologies in order to be able to do

459
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,200
them. you needed the driver, the science

460
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,120
driver, but then you also needed the

461
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,600
technological capability to actually go

462
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,120
ahead and implement uh the mission that

463
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,080
you were trying to do.

464
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,520
Um so today I'm just going to visit the

465
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,840
similar sequence with some of my

466
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,679
favorite places um in the solar system.

467
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,559
You know, I can never resist um talking

468
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,120
about Titan down there in the uh lower

469
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,039
right. Um I'll visit Earth very briefly

470
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,080
at the end. Um, I'll start out with

471
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,080
Venus there in the upper left, uh, and

472
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,120
come around to Mars, which obviously has

473
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,520
the most complexity, um, and I think

474
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,400
some of the most interesting, um,

475
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,520
stories. Now, Venus is is particularly

476
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,679
interesting, I think, um, long a target

477
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,720
of exploration by the Soviet Union, and

478
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,440
that's Vanera 14, uh, down there, a

479
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,640
surface image from Vanera 14 at the

480
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,640
bottom of the slide. Um, and as as you

481
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,640
well know, Venus is a particularly

482
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,799
fascinating target in this solar system

483
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,400
and now especially even more so in the

484
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,400
in the context of exoplanets because

485
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,400
here you have this planet that's about

486
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,080
the same size as Earth. Uh, it's made

487
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,160
of, we think because of similar

488
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,240
densities, made of probably largely the

489
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,240
same materials as the Earth. It should

490
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,760
only be 10 to 20 degrees centigrade

491
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,720
hotter than the Earth because of its

492
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,280
proximity to the Sun. Um, and yet it's

493
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,799
gone through this very different um,

494
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,320
evolution,

495
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,280
losing an oceans's worth of water

496
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,240
probably about three and a half uh to

497
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,960
maybe four billion years ago. Uh,

498
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,520
dominated by volcanic activity is a

499
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,320
typical uh, Venuian surface that you see

500
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,480
at the top center. Uh, these are Mellin

501
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,720
data that you see at the top, Mellan

502
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,280
radar data and Mellin topographic and

503
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,400
radar data on the globe at the left. So

504
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,799
again, an Earth-sized planet, but a very

505
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,280
very different evolutionary

506
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:39,039
path. Uh lack of a magnetic field. Um uh

507
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:43,440
just an absolutely fascinating planet.

508
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,840
We started in this case exploring Venus

509
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,120
uh in a similar sequence. First we had

510
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,720
flyby missions, then we had orbiters um

511
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,039
in the case of the US Pioneer Venus and

512
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,440
and then the Mellan mission.

513
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,679
uh and in the case of the Russians, a

514
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,000
large number of missions including a

515
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,159
large number of surface landers as well

516
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,840
as the Vanera 1516 uh radar orbiter. Uh

517
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,159
and then they also had a balloon

518
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,880
mission. So adding that mobility uh

519
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,679
piece with the Vega balloons um down to

520
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,440
the surface. The US has uh long

521
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,320
investigated

522
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,000
going back to Venus um with several

523
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,799
different kinds of missions. one of

524
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,240
which is a static lander for that um

525
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,480
seismology uh investigation. Very hard

526
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,039
to do because you need to keep a

527
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,200
seismometer alive for at least probably

528
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,600
three to six months. You really want it

529
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,760
to last for a couple years uh so that

530
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,679
you can catch not just one quake quake

531
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,840
but a large number of quakes and a large

532
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,000
enough one that it actually sets up

533
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,840
resonances in the entire planet so that

534
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,919
you can get a deep interior structure of

535
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,840
the planet. Part of the mystery of

536
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,159
understanding why Venus went down this

537
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,480
very different uh evolutionary path than

538
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,919
Earth did is really to get a detailed

539
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,559
interior map. But as we all know, it is

540
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,840
500° centigrade on the surface of Venus.

541
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,760
Um so it is very hard to operate uh

542
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,520
surface landers. As most of you probably

543
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,159
know, the Vanera landers actually burned

544
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,480
up from the out inside out because they

545
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,640
were so well insulated from the Venujian

546
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,400
atmosphere that the electronics inside

547
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,120
could not vent. So they actually

548
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,240
overheated from the inside only lasting

549
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,720
a few hours on the surface.

550
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,200
But we have these hugely significant

551
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,039
questions for Venus like are these rough

552
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,280
bright areas you see in the center of

553
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,919
Venus. Those are called tessra. They're

554
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,720
continentlike regions. And if they have

555
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,679
granitic rock that would tell you that

556
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,799
Venus indeed held a lot of water and and

557
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,720
held water in its interior early in its

558
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,120
history. So the composition of these

559
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,240
regions is really critical. So we have

560
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,360
to think about what would our ideal next

561
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,559
mission to Venus be. Uh there have been

562
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,039
a couple orbiters uh both from Japan and

563
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,880
from Europe uh that have gone to Venus

564
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,880
mostly studying the Venujian atmosphere

565
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,320
which has a whole series I'm a surface

566
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
geologist you can tell. Oh yeah the

567
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,159
atmosphere. Um, so we've had two

568
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,679
missions that have really focused on the

569
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:19,200
atmosphere uh since Mellin, which Mellin

570
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,480
ended in 94. So really long time ago.

571
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,080
I'm obviously a little bitter about

572
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,200
this. Um, and we have not been back to

573
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,240
the surface of Venus to address any of

574
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,480
these huge questions that Malan unveiled

575
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,200
about why Venus went down this different

576
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,760
evolutionary path. In this current

577
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,799
discovery round, there are actually uh

578
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,760
two missions being uh proposed. Uh one

579
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,600
of which is a surface uh probe lander

580
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
that would last for a couple hours, get

581
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
surface chemistry and atmospheric

582
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,400
chemistry. And the other one is an

583
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,559
orbiter mission uh that would get um

584
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,720
near infrared. You can see through some

585
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,400
of the windows in the atmosphere and get

586
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,640
some of the surface chemistry. for

587
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,559
example, would be capable of detecting

588
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,440
erupting volcanoes

589
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,360
um and would also get much higher

590
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,960
resolution topography which would help

591
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,360
us answer some of these questions. Full

592
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,279
disclosure, I am a I'm a collaborator on

593
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,440
that mission called Veraritoss. So,

594
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,559
there are missions to get back and we've

595
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,039
long looked at at at mobility for Venus

596
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,600
mostly in balloons. Um because with a

597
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,640
balloon you could go up to higher levels

598
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,919
in the atmosphere uh where it's cooler,

599
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,640
cool your electronics down uh use the

600
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,039
super rotation to move uh and then lower

601
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,919
back down to the surface where it's hot,

602
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,080
you know, do some surface chemistry, pop

603
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,919
back up higher where it's cooler again.

604
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,320
Unfortunately, those are fairly complex

605
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,480
missions that would require technology

606
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,279
development, might require high

607
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,080
temperature electronics. Um, and

608
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,760
therefore, the science is there. We know

609
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,240
what questions, we know what we want to

610
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,039
do, but the funding and the technology

611
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,799
are both lagging behind. Um, so Venus is

612
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,480
a really frustrating place, but because

613
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,799
because of these high temperatures, um,

614
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,720
really expansive exploration of the

615
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,600
surface, which is what we see at Mars,

616
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,440
is needed at Venus, but the technology

617
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,880
is holding us back in a way that doesn't

618
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,640
allow us to do it affordably.

619
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,720
Now, I'm going to go I clearly like

620
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,520
extreme places because I'm going from

621
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,600
Venus, which is very hot, uh, to Titan,

622
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,400
which is about 90° Kelvin on the

623
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,159
surface. Um and Titan again follows one

624
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,159
of these typical progressions. First

625
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,120
really studied by the Voyager spacecraft

626
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,600
in flyby mode of the Shatternian system.

627
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,279
Um one of the largest moons in the solar

628
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,679
system and as you can see from the

629
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,520
Cassini image uh obviously the next

630
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,440
following a flyby we had the orbiter

631
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,039
mission to the Saturnian system of

632
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,720
Cassini. Um Titan is the only uh body in

633
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,840
the solar system with a substantial

634
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,720
atmosphere mostly nitrogen like ours. uh

635
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,799
and uh Jonathan Lenin and Sushi Lata put

636
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,279
together a great uh paper talking about

637
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,600
the fact that methane has this whole

638
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,159
cycle where it's being released from the

639
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,640
subsurface goes up into the atmosphere

640
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,039
is uh photochemically

641
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,440
uh split apart but you also have this

642
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,440
whole cycle where it actually rains

643
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,760
methane and ethane on Titan. There's a

644
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,960
whole hydraologic cycle with hydro

645
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,559
hydraology being uh replaced by

646
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,600
hydrocarbons. Um so a really fascinating

647
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,880
place and the only other place in the

648
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,279
solar system where we actually have um

649
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,000
open bodies of liquid in this case seas

650
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,799
and rivers of liquid methane and ethane

651
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,880
exchanging gas with the atmosphere and

652
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,400
potentially places to go to understand

653
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:49,360
the limits um of life in in our solar

654
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:52,480
system. So really interesting place.

655
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,000
So even though uh Cassini was actually

656
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
an interesting mission because it

657
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,080
combined being an orbiter with actually

658
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,840
having a surface probe so that you got

659
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,640
down to the surface with the Huygens's

660
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,760
mission. But clearly with the discovery

661
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,039
of these bodies of open liquid um on

662
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,520
Titan the the seas of Titan which are

663
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,240
predominantly located at the northern uh

664
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,480
the northern pole quickly became an

665
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,240
object of study for potential future

666
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,480
exploration.

667
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,799
So I spent about five years working on a

668
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,200
proposal for NASA called the Titan Mari

669
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,240
Explorer. It's an artist conception you

670
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,520
see at the at the uh right and on the

671
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,240
left is a map of Lijia Mari which is one

672
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,640
of the larger seas on Titan where you

673
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,039
could fit as you see the dash line in

674
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,960
kind of the center of the sea. Um that's

675
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,720
the landing ellipse arrow ellipse. So

676
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,559
you can actually fit um landing a probe

677
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,039
right directly into the sea which would

678
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,520
then float on the surface. Um and those

679
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,600
are just uh Monte Carlo simulations of

680
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,559
some of the paths uh that the lander

681
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,559
would take. The floating probe uh based

682
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:03,600
on wind models uh for uh Titan those uh

683
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,440
windy green lines uh and and the little

684
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,200
uh rose diagrams are just the elevation

685
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,159
of the surface to say how far would you

686
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,880
be able to see to the horizon.

687
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,039
So this mission is a particularly

688
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,720
interesting example of technology

689
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,080
readiness

690
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,720
uh allowing us or not allowing us to go

691
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,880
do a more in-depth ex uh exploration of

692
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,039
a planetary surface. The question was

693
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,960
pretty clear right only open bodies of

694
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,080
liquid in the solar system so high

695
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,000
priority target not to mention

696
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,200
exploration of the limits of life in our

697
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,600
solar system. Does life require water uh

698
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,640
to evolve or does it just require a

699
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,720
liquid? Could liquid methane and ethane

700
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,159
uh serve that role? So very interesting

701
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,440
astrobiology target along with this

702
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,960
uniqueness of of a hydraologic like

703
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,720
cycle.

704
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,159
But the problem is you have to live for

705
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,840
a very long time um in order to explore

706
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,480
this in in a very cold environment. So

707
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,480
at the time NASA came forward with a a

708
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,720
program uh for what they called

709
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,720
government furnished equipment which was

710
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,000
a technology test of an advanced

711
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,799
sterling radioisotope cooler uh which

712
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,600
used plutonium to create a hot side and

713
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,320
a cool cycle to drive a sterling uh

714
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,200
engine to provide the power. This is

715
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,840
perfect for Titan because the waste heat

716
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,240
from the ASRG would actually keep the

717
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,840
temperature inside the probe. um at at

718
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,520
sort of close to earth ambient

719
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,200
temperatures. So you wouldn't have to do

720
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,440
any exotic um sealing of the capsule. It

721
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,200
would just stay nice and kind of toasty

722
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,919
uh inside allowing us to use

723
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,360
conventional electronics and survive on

724
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,279
the surface of Titan. Um the problem is

725
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,840
the advanced sterling radioisotope

726
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,919
generators were not at a high enough

727
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,919
state of technological readiness to

728
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,559
actually be put on a spacecraft mission

729
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,960
and sent across the solar system. Um so

730
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,520
in the end NASA actually abandoned the

731
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,000
program um for a while of even working

732
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,600
on the ASRGs because they were having

733
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,520
such trouble getting the technology

734
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,919
readiness level up much beyond a TRL4

735
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,039
a and so in this case it was a really

736
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,760
frustrating example the science is there

737
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,679
the funding was almost there but the

738
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,720
technology actually wasn't ready this

739
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,039
you can do this mission um on solar but

740
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,880
it's obviously on and batteries but it's

741
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,240
obviously very hard. Um, and

742
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,799
conventional um, RTGs are make it less

743
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,960
optimal. So, you really needed a

744
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,240
technology solution to help you out with

745
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,559
this and it didn't happen. So, that's

746
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,320
really sad, but luckily for me, we're

747
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,480
still going back to Titan and for

748
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,960
everyone, not just me. Luckily for

749
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,240
everyone. Uh, so you work with what you

750
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,559
can, right? There are still lots of

751
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,200
compelling science questions for Titan.

752
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,600
Um and so uh this is Zibby Turtles

753
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,799
Dragonfly mission which was selected a

754
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,799
few years ago. Um it's an octacopter

755
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:11,120
that will uh land on Titan uh I think in

756
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,520
I think right now the date is 33. Um

757
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,360
and explore the equatorial zone where we

758
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,600
get intermittent rain. So there are

759
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,760
surfaces that get wet and get dry and

760
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,000
there are areas that we think are dried

761
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,200
out areas where there had pre previously

762
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,120
been standing liquids. So again, not

763
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,960
probably, in my opinion, quite as good

764
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,919
of a target as those seas at the North

765
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,039
Pole, but really still able to address

766
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,240
some of these outstanding

767
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,120
astrobiological questions for Titan and

768
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,559
using mobility in a different way. You

769
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,440
know, in the lakes, we were actually

770
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,919
using just the the wind moving the probe

771
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,320
around on the lake surface, but in this

772
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,399
case, we could actually use aerial

773
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,279
mobility because the Titan atmosphere is

774
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,240
so dense and cover actually pretty far

775
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,240
distances and explore a lot of different

776
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,399
geological terrains from the dunes that

777
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,360
you see here in this artist conception

778
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,000
all the way to an impact crater uh

779
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,919
that's a little further on its on its uh

780
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,279
journey.

781
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,519
I want to spend uh uh the last part

782
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,080
obviously talking about this place uh

783
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,399
Mars um that you see behind me and on

784
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,080
the screen. Um and Mars is obviously,

785
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,519
you know, as we look at the path of

786
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,840
exploration, um I find the Mars story to

787
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,360
be a particularly fascinating one

788
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,279
because again, you have this very

789
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,000
similar progression, right? We went from

790
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,840
orbital missions, uh we refined the

791
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,399
science questions, we landed on the

792
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,399
surface, we then developed mobility, and

793
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,440
right now we're looking at moving into

794
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:46,559
an era of of sample return and human

795
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,559
exploration. So following very much this

796
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,480
kind of uh cookbook that we laid out

797
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,480
with the moon, we've been doing the same

798
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,200
thing with Mars, but laid out over a

799
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,039
much much longer time period. And the

800
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,559
length of that time period, I'm going to

801
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:03,039
argue, has to do with not just funding

802
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,440
and technology, but also has to actually

803
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,159
do with the science and how we progress

804
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,080
the science forward. So most of you know

805
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,919
obviously Mars along a target of

806
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,240
fascination because of these dried up

807
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,799
rivereds that you can see that was are

808
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,360
uh pointed out seen in the mariner data

809
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,080
fly by m early flyby missions but then

810
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,480
of course uh well mapped um by the

811
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,519
Viking mission with its two orbiters and

812
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,799
two landers on the surface and because

813
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,399
we got this amazing Viking data set of

814
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:38,000
Mars we've been able to with subsequent

815
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,799
orbiters but also subsequent landers

816
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,440
get down to the surface and then use

817
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,200
mobility to try to answer more and more

818
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,559
sophisticated

819
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,039
uh questions.

820
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,960
But with the Viking lander, which is

821
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,799
over on the far right, we also stumbled

822
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,799
in a way that I think is particularly

823
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,320
interesting because obviously as as most

824
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,240
of you know, one of the prime questions

825
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,640
that Viking was trying to answer was the

826
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,440
question we're still trying to answer is

827
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,919
did life evolve on Mars? And I think a

828
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,679
lot of you know the story that um my dad

829
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,760
worked for NASA. I was at the Viking

830
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,119
launches. I was 14 years old to date

831
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,560
myself. and Carl Sean and Jerry Soffen

832
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,639
were there and they were giving talks

833
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,040
about why we were exploring Mars and

834
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,639
looking for life. And I said, "Wow,

835
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,599
that's really cool. I'm going to be a

836
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,520
planetary geologist and do that, too."

837
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,079
And that's what I've done. And here we

838
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,760
still are talking about was there life

839
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,919
on Mars? How are we going to try to

840
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,399
figure this out? But obviously, as you

841
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:41,200
well know, the Viking lander experiment

842
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,480
used the science that we had at the time

843
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,040
and our understanding of life to design

844
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,440
an experiment to search for life that

845
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,159
was just fundamentally flawed based on

846
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,000
Mars and what we now know about Mars. We

847
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,919
were never going to get a positive

848
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,079
result from the Viking lander

849
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,240
experiment. putting putting water and

850
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,320
nutrient-rich uh mixing that with a soil

851
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,040
at the top of Mars surface is not going

852
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,040
to do anything for you because of the

853
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,440
fact that the top surface of Mars is so

854
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,920
heavily radiated full of things like

855
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,000
perchlorates. But we didn't have enough

856
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,839
information to design that experiment in

857
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,240
the way. So it wasn't that those people

858
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,079
were doing anything wrong. They designed

859
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,000
the experiment to answer the science

860
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,480
question with the information they had

861
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,320
at the time. But of course, there was a

862
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,640
feeling that when they got a negative

863
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,720
result to the life experiment on Viking,

864
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,880
that there was a lot lack of interest

865
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,800
from NASA and the scientific community,

866
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,720
not really from the scientists, but

867
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,160
certainly from the broader public. Oh,

868
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,760
there's no life on Mars. It's just

869
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,640
another dead planet. Why go back? Um and

870
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,400
as time has gone on that did have a

871
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,280
partially cause a pause along with

872
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,200
funding issues of exploring Mars. But

873
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,960
then as we got more sophisticated

874
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,920
realized and understood Mars better, we

875
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,240
designed more and more complex missions

876
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,400
to Mars that really followed this

877
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,920
premise of trying to understand the

878
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
first thing you have to do is step back

879
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,599
and try to understand the habitability.

880
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,760
And obviously one of the things that um

881
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
that Curiosity

882
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,119
uh has done for us and this is obviously

883
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,680
a shot of Gail Crater from the Curiosity

884
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,520
lander. Those beautiful beautiful layers

885
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,280
of rock that we know many of them were

886
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,520
laid down in water. This issue that

887
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,079
water did persist for very long periods

888
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,280
of time on Mars and that we know that

889
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,880
habitable environments existed. We also

890
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,720
have gotten much more sophisticated

891
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,480
about what would it take to actually

892
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,440
find life on Mars. Um, and this is from

893
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,320
a a NASA astrobiology website called the

894
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,560
ladder of life that I particularly like

895
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,320
because it really gets to this issue of

896
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,720
how do you design a scientific

897
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,000
experiment to actually try to answer the

898
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,599
question you're trying to answer? And

899
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,280
you think that's trivial. Any of us who

900
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,920
are scientists or engineers know that's

901
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,040
not trivial. It is really hard to make

902
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,760
sure you're designing your instrument to

903
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,599
really get at the answer when you might

904
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,119
not actually know what the answer looks

905
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,000
like. And obviously there is now over

906
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:20,000
the last uh well it's not obvious over

907
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,359
the last 5 to 10 years increasingly

908
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
interesting study by astrobiologists

909
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,720
around the concept of life as we don't

910
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,560
know it. because this ladder of life

911
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,800
which is basically how we go about

912
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,079
searching for life uh in our solar

913
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,160
system and then beyond does really is

914
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,560
really based on earth life. So we look

915
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,280
for biomolecule components, we look for

916
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,200
functional molecules like DNA or RNA,

917
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,119
we're looking for metabolism and then

918
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,119
ultimately Darwinian evolution when we

919
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,520
search or design an experiment to search

920
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,599
for life. the scientific community is

921
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,839
having increasingly interesting

922
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,960
conversations about how do you search

923
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,480
for life as we don't know it. Um and

924
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,000
obviously some of these things still

925
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,040
hold.

926
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,200
So, as we go into a new site on Mars

927
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,880
with Perseverance, and this is Jazerero

928
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,760
Crater, uh, where the Perseverance

929
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,640
lander is now sitting, a really good

930
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,160
example of how that orbital data, and

931
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,760
you know, I sort of presented on that

932
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,000
early slide this how we explore

933
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,720
planetary surfaces, this kind of linear

934
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,839
progression. But of course, it's not. We

935
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,599
need increasingly sophisticated um

936
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,000
orbiters to get ground data that helps

937
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,400
us then decide and refine where we send

938
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,720
landed missions. And in this case, these

939
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,960
colors on this are from orbital data

940
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,160
telling us there are clays on the

941
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,800
surface in this uh delta region on Mars.

942
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,359
Uh that would be an environment, the

943
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,760
type of environment in which life could

944
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,920
originate. Hence the choice of that for

945
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,240
the perseverance uh landing. And of

946
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,000
course, here is Perseverance itself

947
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:03,359
being lowered down uh onto the surface

948
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,880
um of Mars um having on it a series of

949
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,119
experiments

950
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,280
uh different instrument tools that will

951
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,640
help us get closer to this question of

952
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,680
did life evolve on Mars? Um and of

953
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,200
course, one of the really fun things uh

954
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,920
about uh this is this is an image. I

955
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,800
think it's it it's uh one that just came

956
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,320
down I think yesterday of uh the

957
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,760
Ingenuity helicopter. So now combining

958
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,720
not just uh mobility on the surface as a

959
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,920
rover but also bringing aerial mobility

960
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,720
along and I was I have been not joking

961
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,079
all along the Ingenuity helicopter as

962
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,520
most of you know has a piece of the

963
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,160
right flyer fabric on it and I keep

964
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,720
saying that future astronauts have to go

965
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,720
pick Ingenuity up and bring it back so

966
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,280
that we can put it next to the right

967
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,960
flyer in the Air and Space Museum uh at

968
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,119
some point in the future. Sorry, I set

969
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,079
an alarm so that I would stop talking.

970
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,839
Um, so I think this will be a really and

971
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,240
we're all looking forward to Ingenuity's

972
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,720
first flight next week, but this idea of

973
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,400
bringing along a recon tool to allow you

974
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,560
to better scope out where the rover is

975
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,440
going to go next, I think is a really

976
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,880
good example of of robotic tools.

977
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,359
Obviously, the other interesting thing

978
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,119
about the Perseverance mission is it's

979
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,880
going to lead to that next step of

980
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,640
sample return that we've only done uh on

981
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,680
another planetary body at the moon.

982
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,280
We've obviously done it uh for both uh

983
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,359
asteroids

984
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,880
um and for uh deep space particles, but

985
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,320
we really are looking and obviously

986
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,440
other countries have also done it for

987
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:45,599
comets, but really looking forward to

988
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,160
seeing the implementation of the Mars

989
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:53,359
sample return mission um that is now

990
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,280
notional for the uh late uh 2020s. Um,

991
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,160
but the problem is obviously even with

992
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,800
these really wonderful cache samples

993
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,280
from uh Perseverance, they're still

994
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,440
going to be really limited. Um, and the

995
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,599
problem is, as we all know, is that if

996
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,359
life evolved on Mars, which we think

997
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,440
there's good scientific reason to think

998
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,599
that it would have. What we really want

999
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,760
to know is to what degree of complexity

1000
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,839
did it get? How widespread was it? How

1001
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,000
varied was it? And one small sample is

1002
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,160
not going to answer that. And so to me,

1003
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,160
the only way you're ever going to answer

1004
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,720
these really complicated questions about

1005
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,760
the evolution of life on Mars is by

1006
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,359
sending humans. Um because it is this

1007
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,760
question of not just looking at one

1008
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,760
rock, but looking at thousands of rocks,

1009
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,480
not just moving around one crater, but

1010
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,119
moving around many regions of Mars. Um

1011
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,720
and so being able to have humans on the

1012
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,640
surface is actually uh the best way to

1013
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,040
move this forward.

1014
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,680
But Mars is really hard. Humans are

1015
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,599
always going to rely on robots in order

1016
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,400
to be able to function on Mars. Whether

1017
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,200
it's from orbital data, uh whether it's

1018
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,400
from reconnaissance tools like uh like

1019
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,520
small helicopters that can do recon. Um

1020
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,440
and in particular also, I would argue um

1021
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,880
from things like artificial intelligence

1022
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,359
that are going to help humans make

1023
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,680
decisions, especially when they're well

1024
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:17,440
out of signal uh any kind of immediate

1025
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,599
signal contrast um from Earth. So really

1026
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,920
important to send humans but also really

1027
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,079
important not to underestimate

1028
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,560
uh the difficulty in actually getting

1029
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,040
humans to Mars.

1030
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,599
But I think um just to close and then

1031
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,400
I'd love to take questions.

1032
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,560
Um when we explore planetary surfaces

1033
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,720
our our ultimate aim is always to get

1034
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,200
back to try to understand how planets

1035
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,880
work with the ultimate goal of really

1036
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,359
trying to understand how does the earth

1037
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,119
work. Um and and these questions have

1038
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,760
become even more critical when we look

1039
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,240
at things uh like climate change and say

1040
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,079
we really need to understand how

1041
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,920
climates evolve and change on other

1042
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,920
planets. We really want to understand

1043
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,480
how life evolves and changes and

1044
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,880
possibly goes extinct on other planets.

1045
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,440
Uh and and I think the earth is also a

1046
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,000
really good example of the fact that we

1047
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,160
best explore and we do the best science

1048
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,599
when we have humans and robots working

1049
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,160
together. And and it's to me always been

1050
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,480
a false argument of trying to choose

1051
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,400
between humans and and robots. And

1052
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,560
instead we should really think about

1053
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,800
what question are you trying to answer?

1054
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,359
What is the best tool? And humans are a

1055
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,680
tool in our toolbox and how do we move

1056
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,920
the science forward by choosing the

1057
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,280
appropriate tool and how do we keep pu

1058
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,200
pushing technology forward as our as our

1059
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,079
uh questions become more and more

1060
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,440
complex. So uh thank you and I will stop

1061
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,920
there.

1062
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,079
>> So Dr. Stoven, thank you very much for a

1063
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,240
fascinating talk that laid out both the

1064
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,400
the technological things we got to do as

1065
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,400
well as the scientific questions. You

1066
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,319
know there are some on this Zoom call

1067
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,400
who are technologists actually studying

1068
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,240
the advancement of technology. Maybe

1069
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,960
they'll take some lessons from what you

1070
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,280
said there. So let let's open it up to

1071
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,280
questions. Can you please uh if you have

1072
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,119
a question put up your hand which is in

1073
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,440
the reactions

1074
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,440
uh and I will call upon uh you

1075
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,640
questions anybody

1076
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,800
Jeff Hoffman. So Jeff do you know

1077
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,839
anything about Mars?

1078
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,599
>> Well yeah

1079
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,680
>> just a little bit.

1080
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,240
>> Our our Moxy experiment is going to

1081
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,880
provide some of that 20 show us how to

1082
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,520
provide that 20 tons of oxygen. But just

1083
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,240
two comments. The first on you know

1084
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,359
related to humans and robots just to

1085
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,240
make sure everybody appreciates that

1086
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,520
right now it takes hundreds of people to

1087
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,240
operate one little robot on Mars which

1088
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,240
which really is kind of amazing when

1089
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,200
when you think about it in terms of the

1090
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,800
relative efficiency of human and robotic

1091
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,839
exploration.

1092
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,720
Um, and the second thing uh that that

1093
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,240
I've I've always tried to talk to my

1094
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:17,200
roboticist friends is,

1095
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,520
you know, right now we operate uh

1096
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Perseverance and and all the Mars rovers

1097
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,920
and everything, you know, so

1098
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,960
conservatively because there's only one

1099
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,200
of them and, you know, unlike the Hubble

1100
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,400
telescope, we can't go and fix it if it

1101
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,480
breaks. So, so we're extremely limited

1102
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:40,000
in what we're willing to do. Imagine if

1103
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,880
you as a roboticist could be on Mars

1104
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,119
with your robots and able to fix them if

1105
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
they break and also reconfigure them if

1106
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,240
they're, you know, new experiments

1107
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,160
become available. and um and and so I

1108
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,200
think that's the real future of human

1109
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,520
robotic cooperation is is is having

1110
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,560
people in the same working area at the

1111
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,160
same time in places that humans can get

1112
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,960
to. Obviously, there's always going to

1113
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,599
be places that only we can send robots

1114
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,440
to. But anyway, thanks thanks very much

1115
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,040
for your talk. Yeah, and Jeeoff, those

1116
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,040
are really good points. And I I used to

1117
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,560
make use the example I think it took the

1118
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,960
opportunity rover about eight nine years

1119
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,280
to go 26

1120
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,839
uh miles. So I always say, you know, a

1121
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,520
human most many humans probably you, not

1122
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,599
me, you know, can can run a marathon in

1123
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,359
in a number of hours and yet you had

1124
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,680
this rover that it took eight years to

1125
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:36,960
go that far. And and I think human

1126
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,160
mobility um as you say, risk aversion is

1127
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,000
a big deal. Um and and it's frustrating

1128
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,640
to me now with perseverance you're like

1129
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,640
have we gone anywhere yet and you're

1130
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,560
just you know not that we wouldn't be

1131
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,800
very cautious with humans that we send

1132
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,960
also but and I think that human and

1133
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,599
robotics robots together is really

1134
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,680
critical for example there are zones on

1135
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,240
Mars that right now the scientific

1136
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,079
community has said that humans should

1137
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,319
not go there because there still could

1138
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,000
be accident life on Mars there's zones

1139
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,280
where we think there is water close to

1140
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,960
the surface uh a and therefore humans

1141
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,400
shouldn't go there from both sides

1142
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,400
contamination. You know, we don't want

1143
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,560
to come contaminate Mars life. We don't

1144
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:21,040
want to uh get COVID like you know some

1145
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,560
kind of um pandemic disease from Mars

1146
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,240
life which I am actually not worried

1147
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,480
about but some people obviously are

1148
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,400
concerned about it. And so the idea that

1149
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,920
humans could approach zones where we

1150
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,400
think that water was close to the

1151
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,800
surface, send robots in to find out if

1152
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,960
that's true or not, send robots in to

1153
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,280
actually assess it, see if there is um

1154
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,200
some extent life, um is a really

1155
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,200
critical one. So that humans and robots

1156
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,440
working together is totally the way

1157
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,680
we're going to explore Mars in the

1158
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,319
future. Um and I think most of us who

1159
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,160
lived through this versus debate have

1160
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:54,079
always been very frustrated. Why are we

1161
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,680
arguing about this? It's it's kind of,

1162
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:01,040
you know, not a not a useful argument.

1163
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,119
>> Okay. Thank you. So, David Newman.

1164
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,280
>> Hi, Ellen. Thank you. That was an

1165
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,880
incredible talk. Really enjoyed it. Um,

1166
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,000
looking for students hands. Oh, good.

1167
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,920
One's coming up. So, I'm going to be

1168
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,640
quick so we can try to get you more, but

1169
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,720
um trying to channel maybe a a question

1170
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,280
or tea up something for you to comment

1171
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,280
on on behalf of a lot of our students

1172
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,400
that are watching too. Uh first thank

1173
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,440
you for uh chairing the um transition

1174
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,839
for for NASA. That was I know an amazing

1175
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,400
amount amount of work and effort. Uh so

1176
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:33,520
thank you so much for doing that.

1177
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,119
Maybe what one or two pieces of advice

1178
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,040
would you give the the new NASA

1179
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,960
leadership team coming on board um to

1180
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,800
help with our lunar? We'll just keep it

1181
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,520
the question to what's your what maybe

1182
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,760
some words of wisdom for um exploring

1183
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,839
the moon and Mars in the immediate

1184
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,599
future.

1185
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,800
>> Um I'm not supposed to talk about

1186
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,480
anything that happened during the

1187
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,760
transition. So I have to be care but I'm

1188
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,240
very I you know I have lots of opinions.

1189
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,079
So I have to be careful how I answer it.

1190
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,000
So

1191
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,079
you know if you look historically so

1192
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,440
this is a whole another subject you know

1193
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,119
talk too um you know or hopefully I hope

1194
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,319
you guys have had one of these talks if

1195
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,960
not we you should get one um on this

1196
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,880
whole issue of of the politics and I

1197
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,480
think the last you know especially 20

1198
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,040
years have been super interesting as

1199
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,920
we've done this moon versus mar you know

1200
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,079
what became a moon versus Mars kind of

1201
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,079
discussion um and I think it was

1202
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,119
particularly interesting obviously over

1203
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:39,119
end of Clinton, uh I guess through the

1204
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:41,920
Bushes, um Obama, Trump, um now to Biden

1205
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,240
of what is where are we going with human

1206
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,400
exploration? What is the target? And and

1207
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,400
frankly, when I first got to NASA under

1208
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,240
under Obama, I had someone say to me,

1209
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,160
"Oh, the destination actually doesn't

1210
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,319
matter." And I'm like, "No, actually,

1211
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,640
the destination does matter. It matters.

1212
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,240
It matters to me as a scientist, but I

1213
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,559
think it matters to everyone. You just

1214
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,559
can't plan human exploration and not

1215
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:07,520
care where you're going. Um, and so I do

1216
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,920
think for NASA as you look at at it

1217
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,839
being changed from its purpose being

1218
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,200
changed sort of every four to eight

1219
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:18,000
years for human exploration combined

1220
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,359
with a lack of resources

1221
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,480
um and very high expectations

1222
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:27,839
makes it very hard for the agency to

1223
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,800
succeed. Um and I think the challenge

1224
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:34,000
for the and the opportunity

1225
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:38,800
for the incoming administration is going

1226
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,720
to be the um emphasis on

1227
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,839
uh balancing presence in low earth orbit

1228
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,319
>> with again stop pitting things against

1229
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:51,520
each other as we worked on David. It's

1230
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:54,640
not moon versus Mars, it's moon to Mars.

1231
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,160
Um, and so this continuity of of

1232
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,119
purpose,

1233
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,800
um, that we actually started joking

1234
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,240
about the transition team, I think we

1235
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,640
heard it from every single person we

1236
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,000
talked to. Continuity of purpose. I

1237
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,000
think that continuity of purpose is

1238
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,520
really important for NASA and it doesn't

1239
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,680
matter what administrations you're

1240
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,079
talking about, what parties, you've got

1241
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,440
to let NASA have some continuity of

1242
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,480
purpose or we're not going anywhere.

1243
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,359
>> Okay. Thank you. So George, there's a

1244
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,280
question from a student.

1245
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,720
>> Thank you Dan. Thank you Ellen very much

1246
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,960
for your talk. Um I I'm a PhD student in

1247
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,839
the engineering systems lab. I work with

1248
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Professor Dec and also with Professor

1249
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:39,760
Hoffman and I'm kind of following up on

1250
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,319
Jeff's question about humans and robots

1251
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,480
on on planetary surfaces.

1252
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:50,000
Um so it's interesting that uh there has

1253
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,920
been this gap of about seven eight and

1254
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,119
then 10 years between different

1255
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,520
generations of Roberts Pathfinder in 96

1256
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,480
per spirit and opportunity 2003

1257
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,839
curiosity 2011 and then perseverance

1258
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,079
2021 so the gap is about 7 to 10 years

1259
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:10,960
and it's actually slightly increasing as

1260
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:14,480
we're going along. So um maybe the the

1261
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,960
other use of humans is not that they are

1262
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,000
faster scientists and better scientists

1263
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,960
but that the cycle of evolution of

1264
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,359
robots can accelerate when humans are on

1265
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,119
planets with robots and I wonder what

1266
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,480
your thoughts are on that.

1267
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,640
>> You know I think that's a really good

1268
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,559
point because frankly that seven to 10

1269
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,960
years that you're seeing it is actually

1270
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,000
a pretty typical cycle for for NASA

1271
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,640
flagship missions. you can afford to do

1272
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,319
a flagship or a multi-billion dollar

1273
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,559
mission

1274
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,720
about once a decade um and that's come

1275
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,640
out of the decadals and NASA is often in

1276
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,480
the planetary science division and

1277
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,400
because after the um famous ALH841

1278
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,400
there became a Mars program line in the

1279
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,720
budget so there was a little more money

1280
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,760
so they could sometimes squeeze two

1281
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,839
flagships in in the in in a decade one

1282
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,599
Mars and one maybe to the outer solar

1283
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,599
system

1284
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,720
But but this is where that funding

1285
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:13,119
piece, right, becomes really critical.

1286
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,040
And then frankly, it's it's compounded

1287
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,640
with a risk aversion, right? Because

1288
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,800
then you're thinking, this is my only

1289
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,400
chance to go to Mars in this decade. I

1290
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,880
know it's going to cost me billions of

1291
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,359
dollars. So, do I want to really have a

1292
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,280
next generation rover or am I just going

1293
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,359
to take more or less a carbon copy of

1294
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,359
the Curiosity rover because it worked

1295
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:34,400
and do it again? So all of a sudden you

1296
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:37,040
also get this risk aversion to pushing

1297
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,640
technology development because you're

1298
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,160
you know this is my this is my chance to

1299
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,880
go to Mars in the decade. I'm not taking

1300
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,240
any risk. And so I really do think that

1301
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,319
if you saw humans going to Mars the

1302
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,640
investment in in the robotic

1303
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,480
technologies would go up because as you

1304
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,880
say humans are going to need these tools

1305
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,800
to work with. The human exploration

1306
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,599
program tends to be better funded than

1307
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,880
the planetary exploration program. And I

1308
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,720
think there's going to be a demand,

1309
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,200
right? Because now humans are going to

1310
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,960
really need these robotic tools. And I

1311
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,079
think it's going to lead to this much

1312
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,680
better robots and humans. And for me,

1313
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,160
that's exciting because that means way

1314
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,079
more science. And so I I think we're

1315
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,359
going to move into a really exciting

1316
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,839
point, whereas right now we really are

1317
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:25,359
limited by this kind of pace of

1318
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:28,079
available budget flagship a decade kind

1319
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,400
of um situation.

1320
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,280
>> All right. It's 3:00. So, thank you very

1321
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,040
much.

1322
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,480
>> Uh, let's let's thank her again.

1323
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,160
>> Thank you. This was really fun. I'm

1324
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,119
really sorry. I could I could talk to

1325
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,880
you guys all day. I'm really sorry.

1326
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,040
>> Thank Thank you, Joyce, for what you did

1327
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,319
in setting this up. And thank you all

1328
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,800
for attending. I'll let

1329
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,319
>> Can you

1330
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,280
All right. Thanks everybody. Sorry I

1331
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,160
have to run.

1332
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,400
>> Byebye.

1333
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,400
>> Thank you.
