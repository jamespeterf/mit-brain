9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,800
>> Okay, cool. Uh so so we we've uh been

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
grading the the assignments and uh we

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
realized that there were a couple of

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,040
things about how to write rules that we

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,040
hadn't necessarily gone through uh and

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,280
uh and one thing that we would like to

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
see in the next assignment uh are a

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
couple of uh are a couple of things that

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,360
that I'm going to read out now, but

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,879
we'll uh we'll probably send out an

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,280
email as well so you can have it for

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,840
reference. Um, so, uh, having a

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,000
paragraph or a overview that broadly

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
explains what the game is about is

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,039
actually really, really useful. Uh, you

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
know, just jump jumping straight

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
straight into the, you know, this is

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
this is how you set up the board and

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,119
this is how you, you know, uh, you take

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,880
a turn. Um, you know, that's the meat of

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,640
the assignment, but just to sort of help

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,080
people get a grasp, especially if you

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,920
thought about your theme really really

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
hard in this next coming assignment,

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
your theme is right there. Explaining

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,360
what are you you know, who are you in

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
this game? What are you trying to do?

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,080
Uh, you know, what's your uh what's

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
what's your overall goal in broad terms,

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,000
not necessarily, you know, very specific

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
game terms. Just having one paragraph is

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
a really really good idea. Um, and

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,640
really like short, concise paragraph.

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,280
And that's that's that's one thing.

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
Okay. Uh, two, a list of components, you

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
know, uh, in the card game will be like,

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,720
you know, we have this many of this many

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,439
red cards, this many blue cards, that

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,640
that sort of thing, just so that we know

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,479
that we've got everything. Uh, it also

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
helps sometimes to be able to establish

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
the vocabulary of the game really really

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
early. So, if all your red cards are

52
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,759
attack cards and all your blue cards are

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
defense cards and you want to say, you

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,640
know, your your deck should have 25 red

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
attack cards and 25 blue defense cards.

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Now, we know if you use the word attack

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,880
card and defense card later, we now know

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,160
what it means. Um, sometimes it's

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,039
obvious from just looking at the cards,

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,480
but frankly, you know, when when we are

61
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,599
opening up these cards, usually there's

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
one person looking at the cards and

63
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,480
somebody else looking at the rules. Uh,

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,400
and just having that information

65
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,160
redundant is uh kind of nice. Um, let me

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,120
see.

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,360
um the the number of players uh uh in

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
this particular in this particular

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
assignment I'm trying to remember what

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
the requirements for it was like two to

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
four

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,400
>> two two to four

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,280
>> yeah two uh two to four number of your

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,239
of your previous uh projects actually

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,720
allowed more more players less less

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,959
players we want an explicit line that

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,680
says this is how many players your game

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,120
supports

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
just just one line make it like an

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,080
ability bullet points and by but by by

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,000
the way bullet points being concise um

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,319
you know making things really easy to

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,480
read uh is a is is is um highly valued.

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,599
Um one one thing that you absolutely

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
should do is make sure that you're

86
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,800
testing your written rules as well as

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,319
your game. You know um don't just test

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
the rules of your game and then you

89
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,760
write it down and you're never actually

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,000
testing the written version of your

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,599
rules on some one line. Uh you need to

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
be able to test the written rules as

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,920
well. There was some there was some

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,599
games that clearly did that and some

95
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,560
games I clearly did. Um and it and it

96
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,560
showed um by the way no one really did

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
badly last assignment. I just this is

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
this is I I'm nitpicking because because

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,040
this is this is what bumps you from B to

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,519
A. Um let's see. Expected playing time.

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,360
Um especially in this next assignment uh

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,720
you know if your game tends to take 30

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,159
minutes uh or your game tends uh tends

104
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,200
to take 10 uh just state it uh if there

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,879
if in some games it takes a really long

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,560
time to set up and a really fast time to

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,480
play then you just state you know

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,319
expected setup time blah expected

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,640
playing time blur. Um

110
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,760
there was a lot of assumption in the

111
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,480
rules and in the design of the game that

112
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,159
your players are male. Uh this is a very

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,320
male

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:22,479
uh uh proportion class right right now.

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
But uh don't assume that your players

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,400
are all male. It's actually really kind

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,800
of off-putting to read a set of rules

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,000
that just assumes that if you're playing

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,000
this game, you are a guy. Um, so there

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
are a couple of things that people have

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,639
done in academia to sort of like address

122
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,800
that issue. I've seen ver I've seen

123
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
papers where they sort of use uh

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
non-specific uh third person pronouns

125
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,639
and just swapping he, she, he, she all

126
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
the time unless they're talking about a

127
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,479
specific person. Uh but it but in your

128
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
case when you're thinking about your

129
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,120
themes and like don't assume that your

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,280
players are male. You can cast them in

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
the role of a male but you don't say

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,759
don't don't assume that a player itself

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,320
is male. Yeah.

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,080
>> So I'm just going to say put put this

135
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,880
out there in the English language is

136
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,520
actually very masculine oriented. So the

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,000
proper way to say in a third person if

138
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,320
you're not saying one says this it's

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,560
actually appropriate to say he. That's

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,560
actually proper in English language. And

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,039
I'm saying that it's off-putting from a

142
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
marketing standpoint to make assume that

143
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,479
your players.

144
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
>> I'm saying.

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,280
>> Yeah. Uh it it goes more to than than

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
just non-gender

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,880
than gender specific pronouns. It it

148
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,880
goes way more than that. There was a lot

149
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,880
of assumptions on like uh

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,600
there were specific rules that assumed

151
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,160
that you were a straight male in a

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,039
couple of games. Uh so let's let's be

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,560
clear about that. Okay. Uh,

154
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,000
>> I was just going to mention that it from

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,759
what I've seen in a lot of rule books,

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,919
it seems like a lot of people solve this

157
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,520
problem by just

158
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,880
replacing the assumption that the player

159
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,840
is male with the assumption that the

160
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,680
player is female. Like even uh yeah,

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,199
I've noticed this even every single

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,440
pronoun in every like post second

163
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,039
edition Dungeons and Dragons book is

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
female.

165
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,759
>> Interesting.

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,600
>> And that's actually kind of an

167
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
interesting way to deal with it, right?

168
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
It's just like you hand the lamp lamb

169
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
shader and said we got to use a pronoun

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,160
but we don't want to use language that's

171
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,039
going to turn people off the game. So

172
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
we're just going to swap all the

173
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,639
pronouns around and all of a sudden you

174
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
actually have a more marketable game.

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,000
You have a game where someone going to

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,240
read the rules and you know and if

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
they're not a straight male reading the

178
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
rules and it's like okay you know uh

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,800
clearly this was a gender pronoun swap

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,039
but but I can read these these rules

181
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,479
that can make make sense. Whereas, you

182
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,319
know, someone who's not a straight male

183
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,160
reading rules and and going, "Oh, this

184
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,680
game's not for me, so I'm not going to

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
play the game." You know, that that that

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
kind of reaction does happen. Uh, you

187
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,720
know, board games are supposed to be

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
inclusive. Board games and card games

189
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,400
are supposed to sort of like be these

190
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,240
huge socially enabling games uh and and

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
performance. So, keep that in mind. You

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
want people to feel welcome when you

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,560
read your um if I can just interject. So

194
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
something that I've seen um happens a

195
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,759
lot like bridge literature is they make

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,759
your partner so one person specifically

197
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,280
is female and the others are male and

198
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
that way you kind of have this

199
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,840
inclusivity but then it helps clarify

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,560
who you're talking about. So if you are

201
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,680
writing up examples or you know sample

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,199
terms or that kind of thing, you can

203
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
think about doing it that way as well

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,880
because it it does the whole inclusivity

205
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,280
but then again kind of clarifies who

206
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,800
you're talking about in the in the

207
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
>> and you know we're at university we're

208
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
trying to be like progressive about

209
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,199
this.

210
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,560
>> I find it's generally people's aversion

211
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,919
to writing using

212
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,440
um pronouns which are gender neutral. So

213
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,280
there

214
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,919
um specifically

215
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,319
people worry that there's an ambiguity

216
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,080
between singular and plural and that's

217
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
why you shouldn't use that kind of

218
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,919
pronoun. But for the most part it's

219
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
always I it's almost always obvious when

220
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,759
you're talking about one person or

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,280
multiple people. So

222
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,720
>> I don't even see really why this is

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
still an issue really.

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,360
>> Yeah. It's one of those things where

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
it's not technically correct to say like

226
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,639
if I'm referring to a single person to

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,080
say they or their but like but then if

228
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,639
you if you're reading other things

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,199
they'll say do that. Um a lot of people

230
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,560
just are using he or she now. I mean

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,080
it's certainly awkward. It's kind of an

232
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,479
awkward but you can also use second uh

233
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,800
if you use second person language you

234
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,039
know you you know when it's your turn

235
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,880
you blah blah blah. And uh also um I'm

236
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,279
trying to think the word player is a

237
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,200
great substitute for a lot. It's like

238
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,479
player one, player two. You can just

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,600
revert to those terms.

240
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,040
Um and it's tough. It's tough to write

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
stuff like this, but you know, sometimes

242
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
I find under constraints writing gets

243
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,600
better. Uh because you know, you're more

244
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,440
focused on how your your your writing is

245
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,760
going to be received. And we're trying

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
to encourage everything in your games to

247
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,560
be better.

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,600
Um, I guess this was something that I I

249
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,080
hit on earlier. Um, try to go for short

250
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,200
sentences like not paragraphs of pros.

251
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,640
Those are actually difficult to read

252
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,279
when you're trying to like also process

253
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,200
what the moves are going to be. Uh, go

254
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,720
for active voice rather than passive

255
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
voice. uh you know it's I personally

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,440
automatically write passive voice when

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm writing any report and I have to I

258
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
have to like physically cheat myself and

259
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,600
you know and tell Microsoft word to

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
highlight every single instance of

261
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,080
passive voice so that I can actually

262
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
correct that um Microsoft Word doesn't

263
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
do a great job in highlighting every

264
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
single instance but uh you do this often

265
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,240
enough you start picking it up yourself

266
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,320
it's actually easier to read it it's

267
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
it's uncomfortable that you're moving

268
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,399
from the from the appeal of writing

269
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,040
technical papers into writing into

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,920
writing for general public but active

271
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
voice is easier for some of you in

272
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,920
check.

273
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,160
Um

274
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,760
this one I might need more more help and

275
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,720
detail um lists of steps and actions.

276
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
So, like if you are

277
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
when you're going through the

278
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
instructions, it's really helpful to

279
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,079
have numbered sequences. Like instead of

280
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
having a a chunk of pros that saying

281
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
first do this, then you do this, just

282
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,519
bullet point it or make it a numbered

283
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,399
list. And it's a lot easier for people

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,480
to follow. Um, generally speaking,

285
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,640
bullets versus numbers, like you should

286
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,640
use a numbered list if a sequence really

287
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
matters, whereas a bulleted list is more

288
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,839
like these are the things that are

289
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,000
important. just not necessarily a

290
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,839
temporal relationship between them.

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
>> Yeah.

292
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
>> So, you know, just just some tips. In

293
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
the end, every single game that we

294
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,959
played, we could play. Uh, you know, it

295
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,920
didn't take us long to figure out what

296
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,640
what was necessary. Um, the games were

297
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,720
good. Uh, the games were entertaining

298
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,800
and uh for the four player uh games, we

299
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,440
brought in extra people to come in and

300
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,760
play and we all had had a blast. The

301
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,000
two-player games was just two of us. And

302
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,480
uh yeah um I'm actually really really

303
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
impressed because this is the

304
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,760
it's a market improvement over previous

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,760
version previous. So

306
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,959
polite golf

307
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,839
y

308
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,600
um all right so so that was uh the stuff

309
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,079
on the assignment and now on to

310
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,079
intellectual property.

311
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,560
This is this is actually um actually how

312
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,920
many people figured out what the that we

313
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,519
had given you the wrong chapter to read.

314
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
Okay. All right. For those of people who

315
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,399
ended up reading rereading chapter 3,

316
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm sorry. Uh it's not a huge chapter,

317
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,560
but um I kind of want to talk about two

318
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
different things. Uh which um both of

319
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,920
which are related to intellectual

320
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,600
property. And one is the version of

321
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,320
intellectual property that presented to

322
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,800
you in the book. Um, you know, in that

323
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,800
sense, that's kind of the game designer

324
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,040
uh um

325
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,680
concept of what intellectual property

326
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,240
is. Often it means a franchise. Often it

327
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,440
means somebody else's story world or

328
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,959
characters. Um maybe it's real people

329
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,800
and their images, you know, like their

330
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,760
faces and and their bodies. If you're

331
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,240
doing sports games, you have to deal

332
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,760
with that a lot. Um, if you there was a

333
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,480
conference this last weekend and uh

334
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,800
there was and one of the the old gardens

335
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
of of the Boston game development team

336
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,279
uh who now runs iRacing was talking

337
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,680
about the amount of effort it takes to

338
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
actually license a NASCAR car because

339
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,320
it's not just the car but every single

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,800
logo that's on that car. um and uh and

341
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,079
and the person who's inside it and the

342
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,160
uniform that they're wearing, every

343
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,720
single logo on their uniform and and

344
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,360
their face, you know, and that's that

345
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,360
that's a lot that goes into licensing uh

346
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
for that. It uh it helps that the person

347
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
who now owns iRacing is also the same

348
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,800
person who owns the Red Sox. So, they've

349
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,760
got the bankroll to be able to like do

350
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,839
all this. Um but, you know, uh but

351
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,480
that's that's kind of the the idea of

352
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,200
what uh IP is from an industry point of

353
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,079
view. And um that there's a couple of

354
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,480
things that you can do uh that that you

355
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,560
can do and to to consider that not just

356
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,200
all right how do we design this game so

357
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,360
that we can minimize how much IP we need

358
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,760
to license because licensing IP

359
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
generally means licensing money that

360
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,000
needs to be exchanged. Um either that

361
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,760
means you're splitting up your royalties

362
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,279
or you're just putting up money up

363
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,440
front. Of course this goes for things

364
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,440
like licensed music for instance. EA has

365
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
entire music department. Sega has an

366
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
entire music department whose job is

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,279
either to create their own music or more

368
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,519
likely license popular music. Um and uh

369
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,440
of course with with harmonics you know

370
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,560
that's half the business right right

371
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,760
there probably more at this point. Um

372
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,040
and then the other thing that you can do

373
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,399
is that assuming that you are working

374
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,480
with a license and the reason why you're

375
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,200
working with license say Lego Star Wars

376
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,279
which came up last in in the last class

377
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,680
how do we do justice to it? How do we

378
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,199
sort of make sure that the fans of those

379
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,839
particular

380
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,199
intellectual property franchises are

381
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
going to look at this game that we're

382
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,399
creating and say, "Yeah, that's that's

383
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,079
faithful. That makes sense." Um, we'll

384
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,720
be actually playing a lot more of those

385
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,360
games, I think, later on, uh, for things

386
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,199
like like Battle Star Galactica. Um, but

387
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,600
let's take Lego Star Wars as one

388
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,120
example. You know, the the idea of if

389
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
you're a fan of Lego, then you're

390
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,800
probably a fan of building things up

391
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,079
with little plastic blocks. you you like

392
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,760
making stuff combined and um and you

393
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,079
kind of like the whole blockiness that

394
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,600
that look of it. So the folks who make

395
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,000
Lego Star Wars Tra I think they're

396
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,399
called Traveler's Tales um and Lego

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,680
Indiana Jones and and those adventure

398
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,440
games kind of had to play that up. They

399
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,839
made a lot of obstacles in the game,

400
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,000
things that were uh that you had to put

401
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
together with parts. Um, sure it's just

402
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,560
it's just just holding down one button

403
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,320
to assemble it from a bunch of

404
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,320
disconnected parts. But creating all

405
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,839
that animation and sort of making this

406
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,680
is the main this is one of the main game

407
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
mechanics of the entire game was a

408
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,399
decision they had to make and and

409
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,320
they're very consciously making that

410
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
because it's Lego where we're going to

411
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,199
assume people are going to make things

412
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,000
and then you find parts in the entire

413
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,760
game that you um can later go back to a

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,560
trophy room and you can see your

415
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,000
trophies sort of statues and objects

416
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
from the game world that you're trying

417
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,560
to do um sort of build up. So the more

418
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
parts you find, they're like the hidden

419
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
collectibles that you find in Grand

420
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,600
Theft Auto and they're kind of hidden

421
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,279
away in secret locations and you find

422
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
more of them, you know, you go back to

423
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,480
your toky room and oh wow, you have

424
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,120
X-wing, you know, or you have part of an

425
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,120
X-wing. You haven't found half of it, so

426
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,959
all you've got like are the wings and

427
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,959
none of the guns or something like that.

428
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,480
Um, and that sort of, you know, they

429
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,639
they've managed to figure out a way how

430
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,040
that weaves back into basic game

431
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,160
mechanics, but it's still appealing to

432
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,160
uh to to Lego fans. you know, if you get

433
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,839
chopped in half by a lightsaber, you

434
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,199
fall into pieces. You don't actually

435
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,720
bleed, you know, um when the people when

436
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,120
the characters walk, they kind of walk

437
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
like that, you know. Um they're a little

438
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,800
bit more flexible than actual Lego

439
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,000
pieces, you know. They don't just move

440
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,079
legs at right angles. Uh but

441
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,880
but they try they try really really hard

442
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,519
to make everything look plasticky. Um

443
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,600
and uh and it pays off. The same thing

444
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,399
goes for Star Wars, right? You know what

445
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
are the things that people expect from

446
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,399
Star Wars?

447
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
>> Lightsabers.

448
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,000
>> Lightsabers. Okay. Anything else?

449
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,399
>> The Force.

450
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,279
>> The Force. Okay.

451
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,480
>> Darth Vader.

452
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,440
>> Darth Vader. You got to have Darth

453
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,120
Vader. Well, if they're doing it on the

454
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
episodes four, five, and six. Actually,

455
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
I believe Darth Vader is still an

456
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,800
unlockable in episode 1, 2, and three

457
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,440
because people expect there to be a

458
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,199
Darth Vader. Uh more generally just the

459
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
the main characters from the films.

460
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,680
>> Yeah, the main characters from

461
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,120
>> from films.

462
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,360
>> Uh dark fights.

463
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,959
>> Dark fights. I mean like like like ah

464
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,800
that's actually interesting because I

465
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,240
believe they actually didn't do that.

466
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,399
They didn't get to uh they didn't manage

467
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,480
to put that in and but in a lot of other

468
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,839
Lucas games they they they focus mostly

469
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,880
on space flight.

470
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,600
>> Catch phrases.

471
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,760
>> Catchphrases. Uh, I think they weave the

472
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,839
catchphrases into the names of the

473
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,280
levels because they can't because that

474
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,160
that's not actually actual dialogue in

475
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,600
the entire

476
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
>> Nobody's Nobody ever says, "I've got a

477
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,000
bad feeling about this."

478
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,439
>> I think I think the title I think that's

479
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,280
the title of the levels and I've got a

480
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,880
bad feeling about this because there's

481
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,640
no dialogue. No one says anything. The

482
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,439
only the only thing that says anything

483
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,360
is R2-D2.

484
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,280
License to voice. Um,

485
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,000
>> actually I have a a really good example

486
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,880
of catchphrases in um I think Rose

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,880
Squadron 64. There's this line in one of

488
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
the Star Wars movies where Luke is like,

489
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,120
"Our two of my that stabilizer's broken

490
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,039
loose. See if you can't lock it down."

491
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,920
Every like second time you get shot,

492
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
they play that recording.

493
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,160
[Music]

494
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,480
And then there's even like a cut scene

495
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,320
where this other pilot is like, "Luke,

496
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,919
my stabilizer's broken, Lewis." And he's

497
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,520
like, "See if you can't have your R2

498
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,520
unit lock it down.

499
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,679
So yeah, I mean a good example like the

500
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,240
far end the worst end was that game.

501
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,400
>> You can overdo it. You can overdo it.

502
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,480
>> Um I'm trying to remember how the force

503
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,200
works. I think you can assemble Lego

504
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,760
blocks from a distance in uh in in Star

505
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,280
Wars if you're playing Obi-Wan. Uh you

506
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,520
can like it's kind of and then like

507
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,039
things just

508
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,039
all Yoda. Um yeah. Uh obviously Darth

509
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,679
Vader's in there. users in the first cut

510
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
scene.

511
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,880
>> You know that bear that

512
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,480
>> Yeah. Yeah. You got to have again all

513
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,679
all all all the big characters have got

514
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,520
to be there, right? You got to have your

515
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,720
nuke, you got to have your Z3. And the

516
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,880
interesting thing about that for Lego

517
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,799
game, again, this is this this is a nice

518
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
mix between Lego and Star Wars is that

519
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,679
you can play any level with any

520
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,360
character. So, um after you beaten it

521
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,120
once, I think you unlock the ability to

522
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,480
swap characters in, which is more of a

523
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
Lego kind of thing, right? I'm just

524
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,960
going to take the characters from this

525
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,919
from the Harry Potter set and put them

526
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,559
into the Lego skip and see what happens.

527
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,160
Um, but you know, uh, that's that's one

528
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,919
thing that you get you get to unlock all

529
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,679
these characters. So, you can play the

530
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,360
whole game with being like the

531
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
>> um I think I like

532
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,039
>> you want to have the locals like touch.

533
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,919
Oh yeah, the locations of

534
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,120
on and kind of like some at least some

535
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
acknowledgement that there is some

536
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,080
sequence of when people go to each

537
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
hotel.

538
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,440
>> Yeah. The Yeah. The game Lego games in

539
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,200
particular basically like follow the

540
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,039
events of the movie specifically. So

541
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,039
it's like each separate event in the

542
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,559
movie is kind of its own level.

543
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,240
>> Yep. Yep. Yeah. Mostly cantina is one

544
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,480
chunk of is one level and you beat that

545
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
and you want two. What happens after the

546
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,600
cantina

547
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
escape from Tatooine?

548
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,440
>> Yeah, tattoo

549
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,960
after they get off Tatooine.

550
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,320
>> Uh,

551
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
>> probably some Death Star.

552
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,640
>> Death Star.

553
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,080
>> Yeah. Yeah. Oh, right right. Right.

554
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
>> I was going to say someone should invent

555
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,679
a game where, you know, all the Lego all

556
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,280
the Lego games and you can use any of

557
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,679
the characters interchangeably between

558
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,039
them.

559
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,039
>> Well, there's one company who already

560
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,280
has technology for for for that. You

561
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,679
know, I would love to see Lego Star Wars

562
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,760
slashing the endurance.

563
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,200
you know, and and even better if you can

564
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,520
change the console to Indiana Jones,

565
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,880
which is a budget,

566
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,520
>> like takes off a hat.

567
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,919
>> Yeah. Like blaster whip.

568
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,120
Um, one thing which uh the game these

569
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,360
particular games have done a really good

570
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,720
job with as of bringing music over. Um,

571
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
actually, every single Star Wars game

572
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,120
has been very very careful about making

573
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,400
sure that it sounds like Star Wars, the

574
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,320
sound effects and the music as well. Um,

575
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,840
plus a lot of it is actually developed

576
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,840
with the Lucas Arts license. Um, which

577
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,440
is obviously under the Lucas umbrella.

578
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,520
So they they make it makes it a little

579
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,960
bit easier. Lucas is actually the the

580
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,720
the company um of the whole Lucas

581
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,880
family, Lucas Arts, Lucas Film and

582
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,400
everything. Um, it's actually really

583
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,440
really tightly centrally controlled by

584
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,120
George Lucas uh himself. Partly for

585
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
quality control, partly for control

586
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,159
freak issues. Uh but you know in in the

587
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,400
end what it does make it really really

588
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,720
easy as for say how many folks played

589
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,200
the force unleashed.

590
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,080
>> Um the live action trails are awesome

591
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,760
>> the second one.

592
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,600
>> Oh I haven't seen live action trailer.

593
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,960
>> They they do really good. They blend the

594
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,240
in game footage live action. They go

595
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,679
back and forth and it's really hard to

596
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,440
tell where

597
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,720
>> you have like really cool lights.

598
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,640
>> I actually wonder whether the character

599
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,480
is actually based on the case of a real

600
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
>> It must be because it's the exact same

601
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,559
case.

602
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,320
>> Okay. Um yeah. uh a lot of techn a lot

603
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,640
of the assets that they use in the

604
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,640
movies uh were brought over into the

605
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,320
game obviously with some with some

606
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,120
tweaks to make it run better in the

607
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,799
game. Um a lot of stuff in the uh in the

608
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,880
force unleash like when you use your

609
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,799
force powers and you smash things uh

610
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,440
which is actually most of the game as I

611
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,880
recall. Um a lot of that that same

612
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
technology is actually technology that

613
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,840
they use in the films to simulate things

614
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,400
being smashed. Uh, that being said, that

615
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,919
particular example is probably not a

616
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,360
good instance of something that any

617
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,799
player is going to notice. It's like,

618
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,120
why do I care that things that are

619
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,760
breaking in the game break exactly the

620
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,520
same way in the movie, but you know, um,

621
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,200
but they do more more more usefully. You

622
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,200
see art assets, you see the same concept

623
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,039
art, you know, moving between the

624
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
between the games really smoothly.

625
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,280
Travis Tales is actually um and the Lego

626
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,280
Star Wars games are uh a little bit

627
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
further out. Obviously, those are third

628
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,240
party. Those are separate from the

629
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,679
Lucasf family. They had to actually

630
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,039
license both Lego and Star Wars. Um, but

631
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,080
Lego already had a relationship with

632
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,919
Star Wars obviously because they're

633
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,919
making these toys. Um, so it's a little

634
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,480
bit easier for them to to to negotiate

635
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,640
that. And that's a game developer issue

636
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,240
I believe uh with a post mode of how

637
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,840
they actually manage that. Um, so you

638
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,600
know, uh, but you know, uh, again,

639
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,000
they're going to be very, very careful.

640
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,360
Even Lucas, even though it's not Lucas's

641
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,360
own company, they're going to be very,

642
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,799
very careful that is at least matching

643
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,919
up with Lucas's control of the product.

644
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,240
Um, and if you're a developer working

645
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,640
with a license, often it's just a long

646
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,400
process of just earning trust back from

647
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,280
the uh from the original license

648
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,360
holders. Jason Dean is actually uh our

649
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,559
art director in this lab and he used to

650
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,159
work with um THQ which made a lot of uh

651
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:15,600
DS and Wii titles specifically on uh

652
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,640
Disney and Pixar products. Um so uh one

653
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,679
one problem with the DS is that it's not

654
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,799
it doesn't have a huge amount of uh 3D

655
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,880
processing quality. Uh whereas you know

656
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,640
obviously the six movies they've got all

657
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,520
the power in the world to do awesome

658
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,440
looking 3D. Um, so some of the tricks

659
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,159
that they had to do to be able to get

660
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,520
the characters, you know, to be faithful

661
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,559
to the characters in the um in in a

662
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,480
movie are kind of interesting. So, um,

663
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,080
do if folks remember Pixar films, you

664
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,840
know, there's a lot of them have these

665
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,200
opening and closing sequences that are

666
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,120
actually animated in completely

667
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,880
different style. Like maybe it's

668
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,600
handdrawn, maybe it's paper cutouts. Um,

669
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,559
and uh, and those are still emblematic

670
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,240
of pixel style even though they're not

671
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,039
super 3D realistically rendered. And a

672
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,720
lot of the DS games that that Jason be

673
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,080
worked on will use those tricks. They

674
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
they'll make a game instead of making it

675
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,320
look like it's all 3D, they make it look

676
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,880
like it's all cut out of cardboard. Uh,

677
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,159
because that's that's that's part of the

678
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,000
movies. Um, and the DS has a much easier

679
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
time with that.

680
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,799
Um,

681
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,799
one thing that's kind of useful, uh,

682
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,760
when you're thinking about what to take

683
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,559
from a franchise or a license is to look

684
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,120
at the verbs that, uh, that that that

685
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,360
come out from that franchise. Uh, and I

686
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,679
kind of I I think we have enough time.

687
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,279
I'd like to do an exercise where like we

688
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,360
pick up a franchise and um and you just

689
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,640
try to come up with a bunch of verbs

690
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,120
that sort of make that franchise unique

691
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,600
or at least you expect to see in that

692
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,600
franchise. Is there um but I like some

693
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,440
some examples. Um I'm going to just

694
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,080
start with movies and see if we can get

695
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,200
at least one that everyone's fairly

696
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,039
familiar with and uh and and if not then

697
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
I'll try books or or other kinds of

698
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,440
media properties. Anyone want to throw a

699
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,480
movie that maybe everyone in here should

700
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,000
be familiar with?

701
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,720
>> Independence Day.

702
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,440
>> Independence Day. Has anyone not seen

703
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,480
Independence Day?

704
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,120
>> Okay.

705
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,640
>> All right. Actually, let's let's just

706
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,760
throw out a few rins. So, does

707
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,760
Independence Day Twilight?

708
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,880
>> Okay. All right. I'm going I'm going to

709
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,760
go this way. Any

710
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,360
>> day

711
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,480
>> Twilight.

712
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
>> Lord of the Rings.

713
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,000
>> Lord of the Rings.

714
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
>> Inception.

715
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,440
>> Inception.

716
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
>> Iron Man.

717
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,799
>> Iron Man.

718
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,559
>> The Matrix.

719
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,080
>> The Matrix. Okay, we hit seven and I

720
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,880
think that's all I can remember. So, uh,

721
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,799
Inception, Iron Man,

722
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,120
uh, The Matrix,

723
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,000
>> Paris Day's

724
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Day, Twilight,

725
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
>> never seen Twilight.

726
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,039
>> Um,

727
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,039
>> I'm going to pick Inception. How Who's

728
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,760
not seen Inception?

729
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,679
>> Haven't seen Inception.

730
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,000
Which which have you seen?

731
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,640
>> I've seen all

732
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,159
not all the other ones. Yeah.

733
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,760
>> The slight problem is a matrix that

734
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:23,000
there's already a number of on it. So

735
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,000
everyone seen

736
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,039
>> it

737
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,600
all.

738
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,320
>> Montipython.

739
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,279
>> Montipython.

740
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,360
>> Does anyone not know Montipython?

741
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,360
>> Holy Grail.

742
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,360
>> But I think Home Alone. Home Alone.

743
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
>> Homeown.

744
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,400
It might have been a Home Alone game,

745
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,400
but I but I bet no one here played it.

746
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,480
>> Home is impressive.

747
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,360
>> They were for the original Game Boy.

748
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
>> Oh, okay.

749
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,440
>> It's actually one of the first Game Boy

750
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,919
games my brother ever got.

751
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,320
>> Yeah.

752
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,000
>> Okay. Um

753
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,200
>> I haven't tried Lord of the Rings, but

754
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,559
maybe a specific Lord of the Rings. Uh,

755
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
which is the king?

756
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,520
>> I haven't seen

757
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,760
what

758
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,120
>> fashion.

759
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,679
>> No, not really.

760
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
>> No.

761
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,039
>> Fashion. I've seen Fellowship.

762
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,520
>> Wait, what about the Matrix? The Matrix.

763
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,919
>> Oh,

764
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,480
>> no. The Matrix. There too many games on

765
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,120
it.

766
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,159
>> Yeah. So,

767
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,720
>> two towers.

768
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,200
>> I'm going to Okay. All right. I'm really

769
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,400
curious how Ferris Builders Day off as a

770
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,039
game. Uh I'm going to if somebody would

771
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,000
like to volunteer a quick summary of

772
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,919
what Ferris Buer's Day Off is about

773
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
which is Matthew.

774
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,120
>> Uh well

775
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,440
>> well okay so the basic idea is the main

776
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,880
character Ferris is played by Matthew

777
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,080
Broadick. Matthew.

778
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,760
>> Uh, the idea is that like he's the

779
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,640
infamously super popular clown, like

780
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,840
class clown kid in school, and he

781
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,440
decides to just play Hookie with

782
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,840
essentially his girlfriend and his best

783
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,080
friend. And the whole movie is them

784
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,559
going around the city getting into wacky

785
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,600
misadventures while the principal tries

786
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,760
to catch him playing hookie because he

787
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,960
hates

788
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,080
>> and it's awesome. Yeah,

789
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,720
>> it is incredible.

790
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,399
>> Yeah.

791
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,919
>> Um, so actually that whiteboard would be

792
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,279
>> Has anyone heard the fight club theory

793
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,279
of day off?

794
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,159
>> Best friend.

795
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,159
>> Yeah. Cameron.

796
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,760
>> Um, I'm going to stand up this screen.

797
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,000
Um,

798
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,480
>> wait. Who hasn't seen Fight Club?

799
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,720
>> Fight Club.

800
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,640
>> Has anyone seen Fight Club?

801
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,120
>> That's another one.

802
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,520
today.

803
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,520
>> Yeah, but I feel

804
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,480
that way actually because I think I

805
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,840
think that game would have benefited

806
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,080
from the exercise that we're about to

807
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,480
do.

808
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,480
>> How could that even

809
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,600
>> like both controllers control the same

810
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,000
character?

811
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:11,000
>> Metal Gear Solid stuff right there.

812
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
>> Psycho.

813
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,960
see.

814
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,720
>> So, we're just going to bring up a

815
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,559
notepad thing. And I kind of and I want

816
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,000
people to start thinking about verbs.

817
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,600
What are the verbs that are that either

818
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,320
are make Paris Day kind of unique or

819
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,919
really you that's what you think of when

820
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,919
you think of Paris Day? When you think

821
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,399
of Paris Day?

822
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
>> Yeah. Verbs. What do they do? What do

823
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,159
the characters do?

824
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,760
>> Bad karaoke.

825
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,480
>> Bad karaoke.

826
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,039
>> Sing.

827
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,279
>> They sing.

828
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,840
>> Sing.

829
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,559
>> Well, they

830
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,200
deceive.

831
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,360
>> What?

832
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,360
>> They deceive.

833
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
>> Let's let me make sure we

834
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,399
>> live life.

835
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,399
>> Lie. They lie.

836
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:10,080
>> Okay. So, uh they they

837
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,559
deceive or lie. Uh they run.

838
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,320
>> They run or elude.

839
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,159
>> They run.

840
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,159
>> They they definitely do.

841
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,159
>> Yeah.

842
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,760
>> They drive.

843
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,760
>> They drive.

844
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,440
>> They do more than what? They trick.

845
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,279
>> They trick.

846
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,760
>> Yeah. Let's deceive you.

847
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,760
>> Yeah.

848
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,080
>> They be spontaneous.

849
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,960
>> They be spontaneous.

850
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,960
Uh, they improvised.

851
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,399
>> They get in trouble.

852
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,120
>> They get in trouble. There's got to be a

853
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,799
verb for

854
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,520
>> and get out of trouble.

855
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,799
>> They mischief.

856

>> Mischief.

857
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
>> Mischief.

858
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,640
>> Mischief. That's a word that should

859
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,960
probably be in there. I mean, that might

860
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,840
be actually a back of the box or or

861
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,440
tagline.

862
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,720
What else?

863
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,159
>> Anything else they do there?

864
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
>> Behide.

865
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,480
>> They hide. I guess that's that if I run

866
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,840
elude those kind of stuff

867
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,360

>> they may impress

873
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,039
>> they impress

>> uh at some point

876
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,480
>> relaxing

877
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,799
basically

878
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,480
>> one guy is very relaxed

879
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,600
>> they is they hack.

880
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,399
>> Do they hack into the computer

881
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,279
>> in the into the uh school computer?

882
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:47,279
>> Yeah, I forgot all about that. I

883
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:51,840
>> was going to say board games.

884
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,760
>> There is only board games. Yeah,

885
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,880
>> that that's too easy. That's a movie.

886
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,320
>> That game was that saying the only right

887
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
move is not to play.

888
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
>> Yeah, that

889
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,760
>> that's four games.

890
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,480
>> Um well, they don't ruin it. Let's see

891
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,600
what else. It's a classic line you hear

892
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,120
that you haven't seen.

893
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,320
>> Do they ever support each other or do

894
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,640
they just like

895
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,200
>> stress each other out?

896
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,200
>> Stress each other out.

897
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,399
>> Scheme is so much better than plan.

898
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,760
>> I don't like these negative words.

899
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,120
This this may not be what the main

900
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,360
characters do, but uh they campaign

901
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,760
uh they they they run a campaign to save

902
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,880
Ferris.

903
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,120
>> Um so Ferris, the idea is that Ferris is

904
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,840
basically pretending that he's ill and

905
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,760
deathly ill. And so so a bunch of the

906
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,840
students in the school are running a

907
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,200
campaign to raise funds for his medical.

908
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,360
>> Well, everyone says in like the police

909
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,120
station police station, she goes, "Oh,

910
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,679
tell your brother to feel better." And

911
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:02,000
also the water tower scripted on it.

912
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,000
>> Yeah. So, so yeah. And and and you can

913
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,320
think about what those those works

914
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,799
associated with like you know putting

915
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,320
signs up and painting.

916
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,320
Um and you know if you look at this list

917
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,640
and the list can probably get much

918
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,960
longer than this but this is a fairly

919
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,799
fairly unique collection. maybe not so

920
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,840
unique if you compare it to other sort

921
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,679
of high jinks movies, but it's not like

922
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,480
we've had a lot of video games in

923
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,440
particular that are in that vein. Um,

924
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,480
and uh and and we pro probably should

925
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,880
have because it sounds like it's going

926
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,679
to be heck a lot of fun. Um I actually

927
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,320
the one game that makes me that reminds

928
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,919
me of this is actually Bully uh which

929
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,919
was released by Rockstar where you sort

930
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,000
of do these things but it's much more

931
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,440
vengeful. It's it's much more I'm going

932
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
to get I I I I'm going to show the other

933
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,679
bullies in in the school how it's done.

934
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,279
Um

935
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,600
>> whereas this one is kind of more good

936
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,600
nature. Um they they parade actually.

937
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,000
>> Yeah.

938
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,960
>> Mr. Parade is also part of the sing

939
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,360
badly part.

940
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,720
>> Yeah.

941
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,200
>> Because they go parade and then they

942
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,800
sing.

943
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,159
>> But singing madly wouldn't have the same

944
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,240
impact if there wasn't a brass band

945
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,919
behind it.

946
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,240
Um,

947
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,839
so you know, you can think about how any

948
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,200
of these verbs, and we we've done this

949
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,679
exercise of like taking verbs and

950
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,200
turning them into game mechanics before.

951
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,359
And you can think about how any of these

952
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,159
verbs could actually be turned into a

953
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,720
game mechanic. The goal, you know, kiss

954
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,800
might be a goal or it might be a rule of

955
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,879
mechanic to be able to accomplish some

956
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,280
something. Uh, parade might be a

957
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,520
setting, campaign might be, you know, a

958
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,560
collection of mechanics uh that feed off

959
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,000
each other. There could be a whole

960
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,599
system that basically tells you how

961
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,119
successful your save ferris campaign is

962
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,119
going. You could make a game just all

963
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,000
about saving ferris, you know, uh as

964
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,679
opposed to playing ferris wheel itself.

965
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,760
Um

966
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,240
uh

967
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,240
yeah, you know, and and and that's kind

968
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,680
of one exercise that you can do when

969
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,520
you're thinking about your real world

970
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,839
systems in all the systems that you guys

971
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,680
are dealing with as far as I can recall.

972
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,520
Uh you don't have to worry about license

973
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,280
of the IP, but you're basically working

974
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,480
with a real life franchise. You know,

975
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,040
it's like if you're doing something

976
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,320
based on political diplomacy or

977
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,800
something like that, you know, then

978
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,320
there are real life

979
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,000
source material things that you're

980
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,440
trying to be faithful to. And going

981
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
through this exercise of okay, so what's

982
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,560
the ver what what are all the verbs in

983
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,839
this idea that we're that we're working

984
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,920
with in this system that we're working

985
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,359
with? What do people actually do? Uh

986
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,240
it's a good exercise to be able to try

987
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,320
to be faithful to that system.

988
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,599
Uh and then you don't have to do it all.

989
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,280
because you know you just kind of cherry

990
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,640
pick and maybe you want to prioritize a

991
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
little bit and says okay what things can

992
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,520
we get rid of and still very still

993
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,240
clearly a ferris wheel game um you know

994
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,640
running uh I think I think as long as

995
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,079
you have some kind of evasion thing uh

996
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,839
you know physical running may not be

997
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,359
necessary you could do something like as

998
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,440
long as they're not in one location

999
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,119
where the principle is at any given time

1000
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,720
you're good but you don't have to

1001
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,079
physically move through a 3D space and

1002
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,640
all that

1003
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,599
>> um

1004
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,680
>> drive probably

1005
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,680
>> driving yeah it's such a minor part of

1006
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,119
the film. Well, it yeah, it it the

1007
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
actual driving is such a minor part of

1008
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,240
the film that that that that you know,

1009
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,720
you you can probably uh do without that.

1010
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,079
Um and and you and you might actually

1011
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,680
want to think about, you know, what if

1012
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,599
instead of this being Ferris Builder's

1013
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,119
day off into Ferris Builders multiple

1014
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,880
days off, you know, it's like you just

1015
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,400
play each day differently and you're

1016
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,560
just trying to stay out more and more

1017
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,599
days, maybe maybe it's a number of days

1018
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,280
that you don't go to school or

1019
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,880
something. Um so that's that's an idea.

1020
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,720
Um but that's that's kind of the

1021
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,200
approach that one approach that you can

1022
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,520
use in in in your your projects.

1023
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,480
>> Great. Um before we hit two, I want to

1024
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,520
touch on another point uh be uh before I

1025
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,160
transition any questions about

1026
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,320
dealing with it franchises. Um, there is

1027
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,839
a point that Brenda makes in her book

1028
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,520
and the Brenda and Ian make her book

1029
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,839
that if you go professionally into game

1030
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,599
industry, you will most likely at some

1031
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,079
point of time probably many times in

1032
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,320
your career work with a licensed product

1033
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,480
and it can be painful because you do not

1034
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,680
have creative control. Um, yet you're

1035
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,920
trying to be faithful to to to to

1036
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,599
what you're working with and uh if you

1037
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,359
and if you succeed, you make a lot of

1038
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,440
money uh and maybe you get enough money

1039
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,320
to start working on your own projects.

1040
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,880
But um it's it's it's a reality because

1041
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,599
franchises do sell and there are a lot

1042
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,400
lower risk than uh dealing with a

1043
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,079
completely new idea.

1044
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,839
Um by the way, if you haven't played the

1045
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,520
new Tomb Raider game, uh which is

1046
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,560
actually kind of uh interesting because

1047
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,599
it's like Tomb Raider meets Diablo. And

1048
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,680
uh for people who if people have never

1049
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,599
for who's who's played or seen someone

1050
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,599
play Tomb Raider before,

1051
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,200
>> okay, who knows about this latest game

1052
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,520
that I'm talking about? It's kind of

1053
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,839
like three three/arter isometric view.

1054
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Yeah, it's um it is two raider meet

1055
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,800
meets the other with but it still keeps

1056
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,040
some of the puzzle solving. It's

1057
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,240
cooperative. It's a very very different

1058
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,680
game in terms of how you play it. But uh

1059
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,680
it would be an interesting exercise to

1060
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,760
sort of like play that play that that

1061
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,839
game may maybe uploaded up here sometime

1062
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,000
and you can take a look and see how does

1063
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,760
that really Tomb Raider franchise so

1064
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
that people who say who look at the game

1065
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,359
still say yeah that's Tomb Raider even

1066
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,800
though it's a very different game. Um,

1067
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,160
you can imagine like a Tomb Raider board

1068
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,640
game for instance and how would that be

1069
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,000
different and how could that still be?

1070
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,359
That's World of Warcraft games and

1071
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,520
Starcraft board games I believe, you

1072
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,920
know, like that's I can't even think

1073
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,599
conceive how that works, but I'd love to

1074
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,720
try it out.

1075
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,400
>> Um, let's see. So, the the other point I

1076
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,079
want to get to is kind of the legalistic

1077
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,920
definition of IP. And uh I don't want to

1078
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,560
spend an entire class on this because I

1079
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,000
know you will all fall asleep. Um, I

1080
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,599
just want to point out that there's

1081
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,359
quite a lot of different ways that

1082
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,359
intellectual property protected. You

1083
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,320
know, people who are creating stuff

1084
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,000
professionally, creatively, uh, want to

1085
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,640
make sure that they can finish their

1086
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,800
product, they can make sequels of their

1087
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,880
product. They can maybe even license

1088
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,760
their their ideas to someone else, you

1089
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,680
know, being IP for some other company

1090
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,520
without having their ideas copied out

1091
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,440
outright and, you know, not seeing any

1092
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,680
compensation for that. But there's like

1093
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,920
copyrights, there's trademarks, there's

1094
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,040
patents.

1095
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,880
I feel like I'm missing something.

1096
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,839
Well, I I I can speak on those three

1097
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,320
first. And and and and if anything,

1098
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,520
those are definitely the three big ones.

1099
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,680
Um for copyright, copyright basically

1100
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,920
protects an expression of an idea. The

1101
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,160
idea itself is not protected. Whatever

1102
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,599
you know if if your basic idea is you

1103
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,920
know in a world where uh aliens are

1104
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,760
attacked by space marines um you know

1105
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,119
the idea itself is not protected which

1106
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,640
is which is a relief because a lot of

1107
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,680
people have made games on those on that

1108
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,680
idea

1109
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,960
>> but the actual expression is so the

1110
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,720
actual um say say if you're an artist

1111
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,440
and you're creating concept art based on

1112
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,880
that thing that piece of concept art is

1113
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,560
a is copyrighted to to either you or if

1114
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,079
you if you're an employee of a company

1115
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,680
then you probably signed over your

1116
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,280
rights to the company that whatever

1117
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,079
you're creating on day or dying belongs

1118
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,920
to the company. Um, and that's

1119
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,240
defensible in court. It's actually an

1120
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,040
automatic protection, but it's one of

1121
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,119
those things where if um it helps to be

1122
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,800
able to document that you've actually

1123
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,079
created something. there's a copyright

1124
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,320
office that you can send things to, but

1125
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,800
for the most part, internal company

1126
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,520
documentation saying this piece of art

1127
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,400
was created on this so and so date by so

1128
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,280
and so person um is usually good enough

1129
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,440
to hold up uh to stand up in in in court

1130
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,480
if there's ever a dispute. Um so

1131
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,200
um same thing goes for writing, the same

1132
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,520
thing goes for audio and music. A lot of

1133
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,400
music is is pro is protected under

1134
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,240
copyright. Um, so if somebody creates a

1135
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,839
piece of music that sounds an awful lot

1136
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,599
like your piece of music, there are

1137
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,280
actually rules that there are specific

1138
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,400
rules that allow that for that to

1139
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:08,800
happen. But, um, I think if you

1140
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,359
completely reperform the piece, you are

1141
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,359
allowed to do that, but you may have to

1142
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:18,160
pay the original composers, the uh,

1143
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,720
royalties for music. This means that if

1144
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,400
person A composes a song, band B

1145
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,960
performs

1146
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,240
a

1147
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,359
performs a song um and releases it on an

1148
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,200
album, band C could actually reperform

1149
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,440
that song and the only royalties goes

1150
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,720
back to composer. Doesn't necessarily go

1151
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,560
back to to tok

1152
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,480
B. Um however, band u it depends on

1153
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,839
really how close they sound to each

1154
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,839
other. And of course, if that be happens

1155
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,040
to be also the composers, then they're

1156
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,440
going to get around anyway. But you you

1157
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,760
see the sort of idea that that copyright

1158
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,359
protects the expression of an idea. The

1159
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,760
composers at some point of time had to

1160
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,720
write down the music, the notes and the

1161
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,040
lyrics and uh and that that is what is

1162
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,200
protected and you can't just copy that

1163
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,760
without at least entering into some sort

1164
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,520
of contract saying that you can. Um we

1165
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,400
have systems like creative comments for

1166
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,720
instance uh that basically people who

1167
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,480
are creating new IP say under these

1168
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,520
conditions I'm letting people do

1169
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,560
whatever they want with with it and

1170
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,160
there are different kinds of creative

1171
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,720
comments licenses some of them let you

1172
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,599
do literally whatever you want with it

1173
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,280
they're like open source licenses and in

1174
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,560
some cases it's like well you can do

1175
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,160
whatever you want with it as long as for

1176
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,760
non-commercial use and you have to

1177
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,359
credit the origin creator that sort of

1178
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,119
thing. Um so that's that's why creative

1179
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,640
comments kind of evolve. So to enable

1180
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,920
people to freely do stuff without

1181
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,680
necessarily uh uh without necessarily

1182
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,119
having to pay and enter into separate

1183
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,920
contracts with everybody who's creating

1184
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,640
IP. Um so the problem is with code in

1185
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,880
many many if code and game mechanics

1186
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,960
actually for this class uh is something

1187
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,800
that I want to consider because code you

1188
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,319
can think of code in two ways. One, you

1189
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,319
can think of it as a chunk of text. You

1190
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,599
know, it's a chunk of asky symbols that

1191
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,599
you type into a into a development

1192
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,160
environment and you compile it and

1193
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,440
that's an expression of an idea. But the

1194
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,440
other thing the other way that you can

1195
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,800
think of it is it's a machine. It's a

1196
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,280
bunch of instructions that you feed into

1197
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,760
a machine for it to operate in some way.

1198
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,720
And those things machines inventions

1199
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,839
basically can be protected by patents.

1200
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,520
Um that that's pretty much what the

1201
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,280
patent system is designed for. patent

1202
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,440
systems a lot slower is you actually

1203
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,280
have to apply to the central US patent

1204
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,280
office to be able to get to secure

1205
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,880
those. Um assuming that you're looking

1206
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,880
for patent protection in the US. Every

1207
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,319
single country, every single region has

1208
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,920
its own patent office and its own

1209
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,280
process. It's really expensive. Um what

1210
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,480
it does is basically give you a

1211
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,000
temporary monopoly on that invention. Uh

1212
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,480
at least that's what it was originally

1213
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,440
originally originally designed for. You

1214
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,920
make a an an inventure then you got like

1215
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,920
25 years or something. uh to be able to

1216
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,839
capitalize on it before you anyone can

1217
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,680
use your idea. And the whole reason why

1218
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,359
it's invented is that you have now an

1219
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,680
incentive to be able to come up with

1220
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,720
inventions. You might make some profit

1221
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,280
off it. And after the the the the your

1222
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,440
patent expires 25 years or something

1223
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,200
because you've released your information

1224
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,359
to the patent office now all of society

1225
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,440
can benefit can make derivatives of your

1226
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,880
invention. So in a sense it was invented

1227
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,760
to sort of eventually release break

1228
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,319
monopolies. I got this idea and I am

1229
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,800
going to state to be upfront and very

1230
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,280
clear about how I made this thing work.

1231
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,119
Say Amazon patents one click and I'm

1232
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,599
going to say for the next 25 years

1233
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,400
Amazon now has this lock on oneclick

1234
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,839
shipping uh and and purchasing which is

1235
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,160
really annoying but it's been quite

1236
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:59,920
annoying. Um and uh but after 25 years

1237
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,520
anybody can do one click uh uh shipping

1238
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,200
but that's the problem right 25 years is

1239
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,319
a heck of a long time and by then

1240
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,119
whatever is invented it's kind of

1241
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,720
obsolete and a lot of the ideas that

1242
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,599
tend to get approved by the patent

1243
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,920
office are pretty damn obvious. Um I'm

1244
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,000
not going to disparage the amount of

1245
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,640
work that Amazon's actually put into

1246
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,520
oneclick shipping. It's actually a

1247
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,760
really complex process.

1248
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,319
But I am going to disparage Sega's

1249
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,760
patent on the giant floating arrow that

1250
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,880
tells you where you are supposed to go

1251
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,280
next. They have a patent on this. Namco

1252
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,599
has a patent on mini games that you play

1253
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,319
while your game is loading. That's why

1254
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,240
only Namco games have mini games on

1255
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,400
their in those screens because they have

1256
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,720
a patent on that. When it comes to game

1257
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,640
ideas and game mechanics, I find this

1258
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,720
really annoying. It's a personal rant

1259
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,960
because uh uh because uh that's I I

1260
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,280
think that stifles creation instead of

1261
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,200
of opening it up. It's really it really

1262
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,599
really sucks. Um I don't really think

1263
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,240
game mechanics fit in the in the in the

1264
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,680
>> really Apple has is on all the touching

1265
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,200
>> on their gestures. So a lot of people

1266
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,599
can't

1267
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,280
>> a lot of people have the same uh the the

1268
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,800
same issue I have with game mechanics

1269
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,440
with software in general. You know, it's

1270
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,400
like software happens so quickly that

1271
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,520
this kind of temporary monopoly

1272
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,200
basically means a real monopoly over the

1273
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,079
idea.

1274
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,480
>> I thought that game rules were not

1275
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,440
patentable or covered by copyright. I

1276
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,720
seem to remember hearing that somewhere.

1277
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,760
So for instance, you can and this was an

1278
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,760
issue which came up when Scrabul and

1279
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Scrabble were at loggerheads with one

1280
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,040
another. There's some weird technical

1281
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,680
detail that I don't fully know, but it

1282
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,079
kind of comes down to the actual rules

1283
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,079
of Scrabble

1284
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,440
are not or the the actual game rules

1285
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,440
themselves like

1286
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,960
>> are not copyrightable, but somehow like

1287
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,960
the look and feel of your game is do you

1288
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,560
know what the specific details are? I

1289
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,880
don't know the specific details, but how

1290
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,920
you outlined it is one very clear way on

1291
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,599
how a someone who's created a game can

1292
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,839
protect the game without necessarily

1293
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,480
being protective of the rules. That

1294
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,119
Scrabble can protect the layout of their

1295
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,440
board because that's because in order to

1296
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,119
come to design that layout, they had to

1297
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,040
express the idea of what the board was

1298
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,440
with graphic design. You know, it's like

1299
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,000
here's where triple words are here where

1300
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,240
our double words. That's an image.

1301
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,720
images can be copyrighted and thus

1302
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,240
protected under copyright law not

1303
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,000
>> well and I think I think at least with

1304
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,800
copyright and trademarks it comes down

1305
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,240
to like confusion right like if someone

1306
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,920
could if if Scrabulus was similar enough

1307
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,079
to Scrabble superficially that someone

1308
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,560
could confuse their products I think

1309
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,960
that is like a major criteria right it's

1310
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,640
about like and and again yeah that comes

1311
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,640
down to things like font you know what

1312
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,400
color is the title what color is the

1313
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,160
word it's even more specific when it

1314
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,640
comes to trademarks Yeah. If if if

1315
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,160
you're if it's like the name of your if

1316
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:06,079
if if if you can claim that the image of

1317
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,400
or or or or say if a a particular saying

1318
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,880
or something is closely associated with

1319
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,560
your company's core brand, you can

1320
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,079
defend that as a trademark if you

1321
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,839
register it with a trademark office. So

1322
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,079
Gam Gambit, the Singapore MIT Gambit

1323
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:21,520
Game Lab actually a registered trademark

1324
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,599
in in Singapore. Um, actually we had

1325
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,040
some trouble registering that because

1326
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,880
we're clearly not the first company to

1327
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,200
come along with the word Gambit. Uh,

1328
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,000
there's actually another MIT product

1329
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,400
called Gambit. It's u it's actually game

1330
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,079
theory bonding system. Um, so so we we

1331
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,839
actually had to negotiate some fine

1332
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,599
waters to be able to separate what we

1333
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,440
were doing was not going to be confused

1334
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,280
with what they were doing.

1335
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,920
>> Um, are copyrights and trademarks also

1336
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,520
for 25 years or are they

1337
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:53,680
>> different? Copyright.

1338
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:57,599
>> Yeah. And copyrights last as long as

1339
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,160
Walt Disney is dead. That is because the

1340
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,119
Disney Corp keeps lobbying

1341
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,880
um the various branches of United States

1342
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,240
to extend copyright so that they can

1343
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,000
lock down Mickey. Um that's that's

1344
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,319
that's that's the easiest way to tell

1345
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,839
exactly how long. In other words, right

1346
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:18,119
now you got something copyrighted, it's

1347
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,119
in perpetuity until Disney loses.

1348
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,760
>> Um, this is actually really annoying,

1349
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,160
which means there's a whole bunch of

1350
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,000
works of literature, for instance, that

1351
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,760
are, you know, that date back to the

1352
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,440
early um 20th century that still that by

1353
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,640
all means really should be public domain

1354
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,119
at this point in time. And again, they

1355
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,280
will pass into public use, but they

1356
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,000
aren't. Um, I know one thing for sure,

1357
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,319
HP Lovecraft is definitely uh in public

1358
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,880
domain. That's why everyone that there

1359
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:48,000
are so many games based on HD

1360
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,000
material um not that but not you know

1361
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,800
whatever's based on Disney material has

1362
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,280
to be made by Disney um or will run a

1363
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,240
file of corporate

1364
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,559
um

1365
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,760
one thing um about rules

1366
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,440
actually I think I think we kind of

1367
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,800
covered that but yeah you know images if

1368
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,880
if the scrabble board is um is

1369
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,240
identified as being key to the Scrabble

1370
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,160
brand. You kind you might be able to

1371
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,839
protect it under trademark. Um and uh

1372
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,000
tra trademark is one of those things

1373
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,720
where all you're saying is that this is

1374
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,520
how our company's identifying ourselves.

1375
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,760
And if that is confused with any with

1376
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,440
with somebody else's product, that

1377
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,839
product is now hurting our ability to

1378
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,760
make money. Uh so there are laws that

1379
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,280
allow you to to fight that. The problem

1380
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,640
with trademark is that you have to keep

1381
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,200
fighting that. Um so Xerox for instance

1382
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,720
constantly fights to keep Xerox as a

1383
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,760
trademark because people keep using the

1384
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,280
word Xerox to mean photocopy. Um you

1385
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,880
know which is a great problem for a

1386
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,240
company to have but it's actually a cash

1387
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,319
drain as well because you know

1388
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,760
everyone's assuming that you know

1389
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,920
associating your company's name with uh

1390
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,520
you're thinking of Google right

1391
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,119
>> I think I think by law actually too many

1392
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,640
people use it. Yes,

1393
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,400
>> it's a band-aid, I'm pretty sure.

1394
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,079
>> So, you have to fight it.

1395
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,720
>> As long as you keep fighting it, uh you

1396
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,839
stand a chance of of hanging on to it.

1397
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,440
So, um but if you you know like like

1398
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,319
Kleenex, if you blink, you know, you

1399
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,599
know, it might be taken away from from I

1400
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,359
remember hearing about this. I was

1401
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,119
looking to find it, but uh Richard

1402
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:24,720
Garfield who created Magic

1403
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,160
>> has a patent on methods of play for

1404
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,119
trading card games

1405
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,280
>> like

1406
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,200
>> and one of the elements of the patent is

1407
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,880
playing a card in a certain orientation

1408
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,000
and then turn changing its orientation

1409
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,760
in the game field to signify a different

1410
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,520
state of that of that character.

1411
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,359
>> Now that's

1412
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,240
stupid

1413
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,920
tapping cards. Yeah, the patent is among

1414
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,839
many other things that are basically so

1415
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,440
I suspect that he doesn't enforce this

1416
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,880
patent or that is not enforceable

1417
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,240
because if you try to enforce it, it

1418
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,720
gets rubbed out. It

1419
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,000
>> is possible that it's not

1420
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,520
>> I don't know the the actual

1421
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,839
manifestation of that is that um I don't

1422
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,480
know whether wizards contested people

1423
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,960
over it, but definitely they're anti-

1424
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,599
anyone else using the term tap. Mhm.

1425
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,280
>> So, which is why whenever you go to look

1426
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,800
at Legend of the Five Rings or what have

1427
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
you, they have the turn sideways

1428
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,520
mechanic, but it's called bowing.

1429
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,280
>> But, and the same is true of any

1430
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,079
collectible card game that has a tap

1431
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,520
mechanic.

1432
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,480
>> They're not allowed to use the word tap,

1433
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,000
>> but that's a copyright

1434
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,000
>> except except that Yeah, it's a

1435
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,359
copyrighted

1436
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,800
tap. The patience.

1437
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,640
>> So, I don't know if it's been tested

1438
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,440
because def I don't know if that patent

1439
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,400
has been contested.

1440
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,000
>> I would suspect not.

1441
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,559
>> Probably not. But it's it's interesting

1442
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,920
that uh however if you look at any of

1443
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,480
the Wizards range of products so

1444
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,400
including Pokemon and I don't recall

1445
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,119
what the others are they all use the

1446
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,520
term tap. So and but seems that because

1447
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,040
of the copyright which they hold

1448
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,599
>> they're allowed to do it but nobody else

1449
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,640
>> a copyright violation probably gives

1450
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,640
evidence for a patent violation. So, so

1451
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,040
you know, um, if you can stay clear of

1452
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,520
the copyright vi violation, the case

1453
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,040
that Wizards has to be able to contest

1454
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,559
the same mechanic in somebody else's

1455
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,079
gets a little bit weaker.

1456
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,559
>> But they might still have a case. They

1457
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,079
just

1458
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,079
>> I think that I suspect that they think

1459
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,880
that their patent is not enforcable.

1460
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,480
>> It's possible.

1461
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,160
>> Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to get

1462
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,359
away with not even calling it tapping as

1463
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,119
long as you turn a card. They would be

1464
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,720
able to say, "Hey, we have a method."

1465
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,760
>> Ridiculous. entering one or more cards

1466
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,520
into the play by playing one or more

1467
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,880
cards face up in the first orientation

1468
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,160
and the player's option uh you you know

1469
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,920
turning the trade card in other

1470
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,280
orientation in the playing surface

1471
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,440
doesn't even say for any reason just

1472
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,400
like they battles you have to turn a

1473
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,400
card upside down or like subway uh

1474
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,319
submarine cards you can flip them upside

1475
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,640
down to change it from

1476
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,520
>> um

1477
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,280
train card

1478
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,960
>> well no it's me a method of playing

1479
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,920
games though when two or more players

1480
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,440
love the block

1481
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,720
>> doesn't say anything about train cards

1482
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,720
So you can see how this gets annoying

1483
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,960
and quick, but there's actually a

1484
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,280
unfortunately actual good reason why

1485
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,440
things like a mechanics and more often

1486
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,160
implementations of the mechanism code

1487
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,000
are protected by patents is in that

1488
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,119
because there are already so many out

1489
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,880
there. If um if your company is just

1490
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,000
trying to make a game, the likelihood

1491
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,520
that you're going to run a file of

1492
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,160
patents actually pretty high. Um, so

1493
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,960
what do you do if you've got something

1494
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,280
that you know that you created? A lot of

1495
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,760
companies just go and patent that. In

1496
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,119
the event that it turns out to be a case

1497
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,680
where you run a file of a different

1498
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,280
patent, they might actually look at uh

1499
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,800
the company that's suing them and say,

1500
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,040
"But you are running a file of our

1501
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,960
patents because we just also trademark

1502
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,480
uh patented something pretty obvious."

1503
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,040
Um, uh, EA activation

1504
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,800
>> Yeah. What?

1505
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,240
>> It's all just mutually assured.

1506
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,079
>> Exactly. I mean well it's not

1507
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,920
destruction it's what they do is they

1508
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,079
trade licenses it's like you know we

1509
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,160
will let you use these patterns and you

1510
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,079
will let us use that patterns and thus

1511
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,680
avoid a legal fight but of course

1512
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,160
lawyers are getting paid throughout this

1513
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,440
entire process

1514
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,960
>> u it's cheaper than actually bringing it

1515
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,720
into court because

1516
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,160
>> you can get a your patent is validated

1517
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,800
if you can if it can be shown that

1518
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,920
someone else came up with it earlier

1519
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,000
>> in time you have to be the first person

1520
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,720
to come up with

1521
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,440
>> although there's also a nonobvious is an

1522
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,880
obvious clause.

1523
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,559
>> Yeah.

1524
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,920
>> And that's why I'm sure that that Wizard

1525
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,680
has never tried to actually use the

1526
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,200
patent against people because they

1527
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,000
suspect that it's not going to hold up

1528
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,520
an obvious clause.

1529
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,599
>> It's possible. You may not want to fight

1530
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,839
it, but it's sometimes the threat of a

1531
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,359
lawsuit is a big enough threat. Uh it's

1532
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:29,760
like you don't even have to be able to

1533
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,680
win it. It just we are a big company. We

1534
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,559
have lawyers and we can pay them. Do

1535
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,520
you? you know, and it's

1536
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,440
um so that's one reason I mean why

1537
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,680
companies that are otherwise opposed to

1538
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,599
the idea of patents will still secure

1539
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,440
patents protect them to protect their

1540
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,720
jobs. And it's it's kind of sad. It's

1541
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,559
like one of those things where you know

1542
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,839
in a city where everyone owns a gun, you

1543
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,280
want to own one. You want to own one

1544
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,480
too, you know, sort of thing. Um so

1545
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,319
that's patents. I've talked about

1546
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,079
trademarks. We talked about uh

1547
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,240
copyright. And one last thing I kind of

1548
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,880
want to talk about is fair use. Um, you

1549
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,799
know, fair use is one is kind of the

1550
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,640
defense that a lot of schools fall back

1551
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,240
on. And the idea is that if you're doing

1552
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,559
something for if you're appropriating

1553
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,480
some sort of material for uh or some

1554
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:18,240
sort of IP for political or educational

1555
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,559
reasons, uh you have a defense. Should

1556
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,880
the case be brought to court, you might

1557
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,559
be able to defend yourself and win that

1558
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,680
case by saying, well, this was the

1559
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,760
reason. So if I'm doing something for

1560
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:33,200
satical purposes, I'm doing something

1561
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,559
for uh to teach people uh about about

1562
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,480
games for instance, you know, and I'm

1563
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,640
going to like reprint rules or something

1564
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,400
and then you guys can can look at it and

1565
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,799
witness of the coast can sue me and I

1566
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,319
can claim fair use. I may not win.

1567
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:47,440
That's the problem. Fair use is only a

1568
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:49,359
defense. Fair use is not a law that

1569
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,599
automatically

1570
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:55,440
get protects me from being taken to

1571
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,799
court. So lawyers fees still get still

1572
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,680
have to be um who pays the lawyer's fees

1573
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:03,520
depends on who gets the the the the case

1574
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,960
but frankly I would rather not be put in

1575
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,920
that position. So there is that chilling

1576
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,040
effect you know um

1577
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,799
so uh just just just keep that in mind

1578
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,480
you know of the games that you guys are

1579
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,960
making these are class assignments um

1580
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,079
but of course we don't expect you to be

1581
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,720
say copying text verbatim from other

1582
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,319
rule sets in fact I doubt any of you

1583
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:28,400
will be particularly interested in doing

1584
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:30,079
so um certainly not copying art uh and

1585
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,680
uh but also keep in mind that also

1586
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,480
applies for things like art that you

1587
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,920
find online um you could protect

1588
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,319
yourself under fair use. This is for a

1589
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,240
class assignment. Darn it. You know, um

1590
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,359
and for the most part, no one's really

1591
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,880
going to notice, but of course, if you

1592
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,880
want to take these games a little bit

1593
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,720
further, maybe sell them in the future,

1594
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,160
you want to rethink about every single

1595
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,760
piece of art, every single piece of text

1596
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,200
that you're using in your game, is that

1597
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,040
is that coming from somewhere else or

1598
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,319
can we claim that?

1599
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,920
>> Has any past students or groups tried to

1600
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,079
pitch their games anywhere?

1601
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,920
>> Oh, you mean like a turn commercial?

1602
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:05,839
>> Yeah. Um, not to my right, but I really

1603
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,760
>> Yeah. Yeah. Do it. I mean, like based on

1604
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,280
the games that I that that we saw that

1605
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,680
that that we played on Tuesday.

1606
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,359
Absolutely.

1607
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,040
Yeah.

1608
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,319
Um, actually, one of the pieces of

1609
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,839
feedback that we got from the gambit

1610
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,440
folks, every single one of those games

1611
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:23,280
does something that not seen before in

1612
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,960
in in car game. Uh, so every every one

1613
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,559
of those projects had a really

1614
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,240
interesting mechanic and as far as I can

1615
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,240
tell, they were all really tested. So,

1616
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,040
All right.

1617
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,920
Okay. So, I'm not going any more into

1618
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,760
like IP discussions. My I spent too much

1619
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,079
time talking to IP lawyers because we

1620
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,160
