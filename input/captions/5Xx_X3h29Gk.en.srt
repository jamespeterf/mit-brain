00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:05,109
(classical music)
(traffic rumbling)

2
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:16,407
(moves into lighthearted upbeat music)

3
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:18,990
(Professor Wallace laughing)

4
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:30,466
(wheels squeaking)

5
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:38,478
(crowd cheering)

6
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:41,811
- Hello.

7
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,808
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

8
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,910
- Wow, what a rush.

9
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,310
That's the final product launch

10
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,700
for our mechanical engineering
design students at MIT.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,660
It really feels like being
on a world championship team.

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,610
- [Speaker] NOMI is a water bottle cleaner

13
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,670
that will save our target
users time in their busy lives.

14
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,033
- Students come out of it
flying high on the belief

15
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,343
that they can handle any challenge.

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,080
It's a high stakes, high reward game.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,088
But let's just think
about that for a minute.

18
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:25,380
Where is that reward?
(crowd cheering)

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,643
Is it in the limelight?

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,997
Is it in receiving the
cheers of a packed stadium?

21
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:33,180
(upbeat music)

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,900
Is it in knowing that thousands
online are watching you,

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,163
feeling idolized?

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,570
I'd say it's all very nice.

25
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,620
It's, it's great.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,493
It feels good.

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,493
But, that's probably not it.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,070
It's really in the knowledge
that you earned it.

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,996
That's when we experienced
the euphoria of growth.

30
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:02,996
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

31
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:12,298
(people chattering)

32
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,050
(soft orchestral music)

33
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:22,924
(students speaking off mic)

34
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:33,960
Many students come to MIT,

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,720
into our mechanical engineering program,

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,510
anticipating that this
is what they want to do,

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,940
that this is gonna be the culmination

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,160
of their undergrad experience.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,570
And so how does that happen?

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,200
Well, we have a production
which is really designed

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,610
to inspire the community
here in the auditorium,

42
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,230
but it's also online.

43
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,680
And so, people all across the world watch,

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,170
with children, parents, alumni,

45
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,030
and so many kids are watching this

46
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,253
and anticipating it
throughout high school.

47
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:10,154
There's viewers in 140 different
countries around the world.

48
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,789
(crowd cheering)

49
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:16,440
One of the things that
I, you know, often say,

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,620
and I really believe, is
that to be a designer,

51
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,100
you really do, you have to
be arrogant enough to believe

52
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,580
that no matter what it
is, you can figure it out,

53
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,580
but then at the same
time, have the humility

54
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,510
that it's gonna take everything
that you have to do it.

55
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,160
You're gonna need to work
and you're gonna need help.

56
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:43,328
(people chattering)
(funky upbeat music)

57
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,910
- Presenting the yellow team.

58
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,290
- It's not at all uncommon.

59
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,630
Everyone has things they
feel confident about,

60
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,430
or not so confident about.

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,237
And you know, there's many
students that will say,

62
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:58,020
"Well, no, I can't really present,"

63
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,170
or, you know, "I can't do
a particular thing well."

64
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,630
And one of the most rewarding
things is, you know,

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,630
people trying, seeing people
try, seeing people practice

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,980
and then realizing, "Wow,

67
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,682
I can actually really do this well."

68
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:18,682
(jazzy upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

69
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,898
- With Feed Back, we can put
the fish back in efficiency.

70
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:29,898
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

71
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:34,020
- And it can have such
a transformative effect

72
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,850
upon one's life, just realizing, "No,

73
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,910
I'm not gonna limit myself by perceptions

74
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,560
of what I can or can't do,

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,057
because I know if we essentially
train, we can get good."

76
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,830
This experience really is
unique to our class at MIT.

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,280
- Paige is a novice water
skier and she's pretty nervous,

78
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,420
so she's incredibly grateful.

79
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,950
She can tell Jonathan to slow down

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,170
with just the push of a button.

81
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,260
- I mean, we're all used to
doing final presentations.

82
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,420
But to do a final presentation

83
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,120
where it's treated just as seriously

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,300
and just as real as like
a major organization

85
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,040
launching a new product,

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,912
that's an experience you don't
really get anywhere else.

87
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:20,662
(crowd cheering)

88
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:26,294
(smoke blasting)

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,860
For the students that are
upstage, it's all business.

90
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,690
They're on and they're doing their thing,

91
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,120
and that's really all there is to it.

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,270
For the people that are on
the team behind the stage,

93
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,450
there's incredible riveting intensity.

94
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,800
They're watching everything.

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,977
They're hoping.

96
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,590
"Oh, let's have this happen."

97
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,520
When things go great, they
jump up and down with joy.

98
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,920
- With Contour, all you have to do

99
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,730
is sketch, scan, and create.
- So now,

100
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,563
let's check on Juliana's creation.

101
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,570
(light upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

102
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,080
- There's just this kind of
tension and anticipation.

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,930
So the experience, even for the people

104
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,023
that aren't on the stage,
is really powerful.

105
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,660
Our aim is to help students
come to the realization

106
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,420
that what they do matters,

107
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,840
that they can develop
technologies that matter,

108
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,780
that they can do cool stuff.

109
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,780
With grit, with determination,
thought, process, hard work,

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,290
commitment, humility, and some help,

111
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,498
we can make a difference.

112
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:45,461
(light upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

113
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,098
(moves into slow bluesy music)

114
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:03,060
So, how to experience
the euphoria of growth?

115
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,530
Challenge yourself.

116
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,050
Think about what you want to be.

117
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,390
Have a goal and a plan.

118
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,980
Take action.

119
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,513
Follow a process.

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,850
Do the work.

121
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,313
Be seriously lighthearted.

122
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,030
Put yourself in a position to know

123
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,223
that you have given what you could.

124
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,750
Each of us in our own
way can experience joy

125
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,503
in the pursuit of our own
version of personal excellence.

126
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:35,760
We can believe that we have the potential

127
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,520
to be better, to grow,

128
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,590
that way we can make a difference

129
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,200
and look back with a smile.

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,334
We can play seriously.

131
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:49,417
(light upbeat music)

132
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:01,822
(light upbeat music continues)

133
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,292
(light upbeat music fading)

134
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:21,438
(no audio)
