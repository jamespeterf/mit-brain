1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,319
My name is Hitan Sonal. I'm the CEO of

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,640
Rise Robotics. Uh our affiliation with

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,160
MIT is that three of the four founders

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,599
of the company are MIT alums.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,920
They recently brought me on board to

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,519
help commercialize the acceleration uh

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,760
to accelerate the commercialization of

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,080
their technology. My prior experiences

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,359
with iRoot where teams that I led

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,439
shipped 9 million units and generated um

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,760
over $2 billion in revenue. And I'm here

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,279
at Rise to help them accomplish that.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,480
The challenge that we're trying to solve

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,320
is that heavy machines are dirty and uh

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,640
they're dirty because certainly there's

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,879
a lot of fuel that's being consumed. U

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,040
in addition to that 88% of the energy in

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
the fuel is wasted because most of it is

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
wasted in the engine and then another

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,879
large chunk of it is wasted in the

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,840
hydraulics. Um in addition to that uh

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,120
they release half of a gigaton of carbon

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,960
dioxide every year. And what's much

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
worse is that they leak 100 million

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,039
gallons of hydraulic oil which is

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
hazardous into the environment. So the

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
clear fix for this is electrification.

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
However, inefficiencies in the hydraulic

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,840
system make electrification unviable

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
because the inefficiencies of the

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
hydraulic system drive up the size of

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,280
the batteries and the cost of the

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
batteries and make it so that the

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
machine is too expensive and doesn't

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,320
generate the necessary ROI.

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,320
What the founding team at Rise has done

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
over a period of 10 years is designed a

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,759
new technology that we call beltra and

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
you can see the inside of one of our

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,280
cylinders. What we've done there is

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,960
we've taken out the oil from hydraulic

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
systems and we replace them with belts

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
and pulleys. And by being very

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,280
intentional about the molecules that we

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
move, we've created something that's

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
three times faster, three times more

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840
efficient, 20% lighter, has half the

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
operating cost, has no fluids, so it's

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
very easy to maintain, and it's 100%

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
digital and AI ready. And by that, I

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
mean that out of the box, this

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
technology has all of the sensors you

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,000
need to build a digital twin and then

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,560
use a an ML system to convert it into an

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,200
automated system.

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,200
Here is a quick demo of our actuator.

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
As you can see from the movement of the

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,360
actuator, it's very smooth and very

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,520
precise. Uh, compared to a hydraulic

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
system, it moves very, very fast.

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
There's no oil. There's no there's

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
nothing leaking here. So, we can take

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,720
this to shows and demo it in ways that

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
you couldn't with a hydraulic system.

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,560
And finally, it moves much, much faster

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,879
than the alternative screw type

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,920
actuators.

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm going to pause the demo here.

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,879
and move on to the next slide. Um, go in

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,360
slideshow mode again. All right. So, our

71
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,599
traction till date, we've sold $1.5

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
million of Beltraik products under

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,959
commercial terms to the United States

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,599
Air Force. Um, they were really

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
delighted with the product. Um, and I

76
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,959
won't read the comments here, but this

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
is the feedback by our point of contact

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,160
who purchased uh all of the the product

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,800
that we shipped to them. Um, and then on

80
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,680
the strength of our delivery, we were

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,920
awarded uh 3 point uh almost $3 million

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,000
in two separate contracts to modernize

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,080
the ground support equipment for the Air

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
Force. What you see there on the right

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
hand side is actually the world's

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,519
strongest robotic arm. And the reason

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
why I'm saying this is because our

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,480
technology is not only all the things

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,480
that I described, which is it's fast,

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
it's efficient, it's light, it's AI

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,800
ready, but it's also very, very strong.

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,480
and we got into the Guinness book here

93
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,440
in the first week of March. It was very

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,120
exciting. Had a ceremony here. Um we had

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,480
Guinness, we had an Irish band and we

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,040
had the adjudicator here giving us the

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
award. It was exciting for the team. Um

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,879
but the key thing the key takeaway here

99
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
is that we can basically do almost

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,159
anything that the hydraulic systems can

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,360
do.

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,280
One of the things that we're doing with

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,200
this system is deploying our own

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
product, a liftgate. And what this

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
allows us to do is get the product out

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
to market faster and get customer

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
feedback. And the liftgate has all the

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
same properties of the core technology.

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,920
It's faster, it's low maintenance, uh

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,319
has many premium features including

111
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
smooth and safer operation. Um and the

112
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,760
ROI on this product is roughly 6 months.

113
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,080
So we're very excited to be launching

114
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,519
this in the second half of next year. Um

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,200
next quarter we'll be doing pilots.

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,040
And what we're currently looking for as

117
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,799
we build out our portfolio, which is you

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,600
see our vision there for different size

119
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,680
actuators and actuators that have the

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,120
the motor remote, which is something new

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,120
that we can do with our system that you

122
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,360
can't do with say a screw type actuator.

123
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
Um, and also steering cylinders that you

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,919
can see at the very bottom. As we build

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
out this portfolio, we're looking for

126
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,360
companies that are interested in being

127
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
partners in sales, distribution, and

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,280
manufacturing. And we're also looking

129
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,160
for OEMs of electric or autonomous heavy

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,919
machinery that see that could use

131
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,919
benefit from the higher speed and higher

132
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,199
productivity of our actuators and the

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,600
higher efficiency and the lower

134
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,160
operating costs, not to mention the ease

135
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
of uh autonomy.

136
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,040
With that, I'm going to stop and open up

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
for questions.
