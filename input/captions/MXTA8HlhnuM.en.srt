1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,920
go ahead and uh turn turn to your

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
neighbor and start. Uh one thing you

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,039
could do is pull out the main reading

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,560
that we did about situated learning

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960
because we'll do kind of a close read of

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,720
that today. So, um, pull that up on

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,160
something and then, um, in the minutes

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,000
that we have, we usually start 105, but

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,920
in the minutes that we have, uh, turn to

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
your, uh, turn to your neighbor and

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
start thinking about why why babies

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,480
would give, uh, cognitive load theorist

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,480
conions.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,440
All right. as a just just as one level

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
setting thing in case you haven't hung

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
out with babies in a while. Like in

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,840
their first few years of life, how would

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,520
you characterize the amount and rate of

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,399
learning that babies do? Insane. Insane.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,479
It is bonkers how much babies learn. I

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,240
mean, a very strong feeling I had when I

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,280
was first father was like like I I do

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,600
not improve at all in a week or in a

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
month or really most years. I'm really

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,400
like not that much better than I was the

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,600
beginning of the year. And you're just

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,799
watching these infants who are totally

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,000
transformed because they are learning

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,119
things at an amazing rate that you can

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,600
see daily, weekly, monthly, you know,

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,360
incredibly accelerated learning. Um so

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,840
let's use we'll just use that to level

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
set. Um let's let's let's take it as a

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,880
given that babies learn an amazing

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,720
amount in their early years. Um why now

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,799
keep talking why would that prove to be

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,280
such why would that give cognitive load

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,799
theorist such a

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,920
conipion and and you can think about um

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,040
how it connects to some of the stuff

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,680
that you've been reading about situated

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,680
load theory keep talking

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,520
all right good what are some what are

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,520
some observations that people made

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
what are what are baby babies are babies

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,040
are significant so what are what are

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,319
what are some of the observations that

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
that you

49
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,280
made. What were you guys talking about

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
in the

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,640
back? What was your group talking about,

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
Gloria? Um, I was saying that if like

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,239
cognitive load theory was true, then

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,599
that would say that babies probably

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
can't learn like anything because

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,800
everything is extraneous knowledge to

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
them and they don't have any long-term

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,920
memory. They haven't formed any skills

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
yet. All right. Yep. So, they're so

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,120
they're not drawing in they don't have a

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
lot of long-term memory to draw on.

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,680
They, you know, they are like the

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,760
canonical us looking at Sanskrit letters

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,080
where like everything is its own sort of

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,360
discrete part like um so you would think

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
they're working memory. I mean, you

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,239
know, this video I think is sort of

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
helpful for that. Like everything on

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,920
this screen is brand new to them.

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,680
There's nothing that they've ever seen

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,440
before and it's filled like there's a

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,959
slide and a dad and that other thing

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,720
back there and all this stuff on the

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
ground and people are talking and the

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
sun is out and all these things are

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
happening at once. Good. What else did

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,000
people talk about?

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,920
Um it's also like the the speed with

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,879
which they learn doesn't really connect

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,760
with like the bottleneck theory and like

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,000
um the theory of like it takes a while

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
for you to like compile all of this

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,360
information but it almost seems like a

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,840
baby sees it one time and is like able

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,200
to retain it. Yeah. babies seem to do

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,800
exactly the thing that Sweller said um

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,040
people should not be able to do, which

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,400
is to be um I mean, would you gen like

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
this baby learning stuff, would you

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
generally characterize their experience

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,720
as sort of open-ended problem solving or

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,440
like being carefully walked through a

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,440
series of worked

94
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,200
examples? How would you describe it?

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,879
Open. Yeah, this I mean like I'm just

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
like going on the slide and going down,

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,040
you know? It's not like dad's like, you

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,640
know, I mean, I think I think you'd find

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,400
more structure and stuff like that, but

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
there's a lot of just like, wow, I'm a

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,040
baby. I'm out there. I'm doing my thing.

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,799
Um, you know, and and the worked example

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,480
effect and the expert reversal effect

104
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,080
suggests that that should not be very

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
effective. You know, the most effective

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,159
way to teach babies should be, you know,

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
through like careful, you know,

108
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
devolving scaffolding of language and

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,280
things like that. And that's not what we

110
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,159
do. We just like throw babies in with

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,599
people all the time. Um and they uh and

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
they learn language, they learn

113
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,160
movement, they learn a few other things

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
at sort of an extraordinary rate. Um so

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
for how do how does how does what

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,199
connections do you see between this set

117
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,199
of ideas and situated

118
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,759
learning? There's a lot of like trial

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,120
and error in it. Like we were talking

120
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
about like hey when they they see a

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,840
block they want to go get they start to

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
figure out the different ways that they

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,960
can go get that block. Like but through

124
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,160
trial and error trying to stand up,

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
trying to crawl, trying to drag

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,720
themselves. Yeah. all that kind of

127
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,160
stuff. Kadus, come on in. Sit with me.

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,720
No, no, delighted to have you. Um, yeah.

129
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,880
Um, yeah. I mean, this this certainly

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
looks a lot more like situated learning

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,919
than it does look like a sort of

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,440
carefully sculpted classroom. Um, and

133
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,800
uh, so for situated learning people, and

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,240
you know, we'll we'll I think we'll see

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,039
this more in some stuff that we read.

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Um, the experience of babies seems like

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,960
something that's pretty important to

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,280
draw from. Um, how would you how would

139
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,960
you how would you

140
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,720
characterize like the feelings that

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,560
babies have as they learn language? Like

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
are they happy? Are they sad? Are they

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
angry? Are they frustrated? Are they

144
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,680
joyful? Are they playful? Like what kind

145
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
of feelings do babies seem to have as

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
they're learning words?

147
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
What were you going to say, Jared? I was

148
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
going to say like they seem kind of

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,479
fearless and like there there's no like

150
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,919
social pressure to like try and

151
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,240
pronounce this word correctly. They'll

152
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,720
just say the word be like, "Oh, good

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,080
job. make noises come out of our mouths

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
whenever. Yeah. Do you want to grab

155
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,000
another chair? There's no It doesn't

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
seem like there's there's a lot of fear

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,199
behind trying to practice what they're

158
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,960
learning. Uhhuh. Um but I think like in

159
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
addition to that, there can be like a

160
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,680
lot of frustration as well. The

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,000
consequences of like not knowing how to

162
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,600
say a specific thing. Yeah. Or or you

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
watch babies when they're you know I

164
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
mean they cry when they can't articulate

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,800
the thing that they want to be able to

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,400
say or Yeah. And in addition to

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,080
frustration, I think there's a bit of

168
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
like happiness when they actually

169
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,919
achieve what they're trying to create

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,600
and then they feel understood. I think

171
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,199
there's some some sort of some sort of

172
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,160
pride in that. What were you going to

173
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:24,880
say, Courtney? Um, same kind. I wonder

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,960
my my daughter, we used to uh we used to

175
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,280
just my I guess it was my younger one,

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,639
we used to just list vegetables and list

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
things you get at the supermarket and

178
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,680
she thought that was the funniest thing

179
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,720
ever. you you would just be like

180
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,000
pears in the back of the car just like

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,000
saying stuff and she's giggling the

182
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,360
whole time. Um you know I I mean if you

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
watch a video like this like this is

184
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,240
clearly a delightful um you know there's

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
there's not a lot that Sweller and

186
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,039
colleagues have to say about like being

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,520
delighted. Um you know I I I think if

188
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,039
you were to if you were to situate like

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,520
the kind of like moral ethic of work

190
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,080
around learning in cognitive load

191
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,880
theory, it's very like learning is hard.

192
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,039
we persevere through a hard thing. Um,

193
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,280
and we control the hardness of it so

194
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,280
that we can scaffold it for people. Um,

195
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,479
and for situated learning people, these

196
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,840
these aren't really I wouldn't even

197
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,039
these aren't like arguments. And

198
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,800
sometimes they're explicit arguments.

199
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,319
Sometimes they're just tones that you

200
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
find in the way people talk about these

201
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,520
things. They'd be like, "Oh, you know,

202
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
learning is great. Learning is the thing

203
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,639
that we do and get better at stuff. It's

204
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,560
like nice and natural and things like

205
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
that." Um, can anybody think of a thing

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
that you've learned in which you like

207
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,199
got better at the thing and it was just

208
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,919
like playful, enjoyable, natural to get

209
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,360
better at it? Anybody can shout out one

210
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
or two things that was like that for

211
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
you?

212
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,639
When I first learned how to use like a

213
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
power drill. Awesome. Great. Learning

214
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,240
how to use power drill like very

215
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,160
satisfying immediate feedback things

216
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,919
like that. Yeah. Other things that

217
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,599
people really enjoyed learning? Um, I

218
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,759
think similarly like like tactical

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,599
things like learning how to do pottery.

220
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,240
Oh, great. Yep. Pottery seems like a

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,440
good one. Learning how to swim. Learning

222
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,960
how to swim was all right. We're saying

223
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,639
a lot of physical things. Good. Video

224
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,280
games. Video video games. Video games

225
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
are a there is a whole science. Um

226
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,879
there's a there we won't read it.

227
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
There's a guy named James G um who wrote

228
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,520
a great book about learning in video

229
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,360
games. It's a little bit like Toqueville

230
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
coming to America if that's a reference

231
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
that you know. Um, but Toqueville was

232
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,639
this European who came to America. Um,

233
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,720
and he saw America incredibly intimately

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,960
in a way that sort of only an outsider

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
could by in part by becoming an insider.

236
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,319
Um, James G is an old guy who was like,

237
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,280
"Why do my kids like video games so

238
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
much?" And he starts playing them a

239
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,360
bunch. He's like, "These are amazing

240
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,640
learning experiences." Um, think like

241
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,279
think about someone learning a really

242
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,599
hard game like Civilization 6 or

243
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,360
Stellaris or put in whatever game you've

244
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,680
been playing recently that just has like

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,880
incredibly complicated systems in them.

246
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,200
There aren't a lot of people who are

247
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,320
like, you know,

248
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,440
Minecraft like redstone building in

249
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,279
Minecraft, stuff like that. There aren't

250
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
people who are like, "God, it was such a

251
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,360
drag that I had to take all those

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,839
classes on redstone to be able to, you

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,600
know, um these games have have systems

254
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,440
built within them. They're sort of canot

255
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,279
almost all them canonically situated

256
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
kinds of things. Um where you're just

257
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
immersed in the environment, you're

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
encouraged to play. There are some peer

259
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,360
structures around to help you learn and

260
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,200
stuff like that. But it's extremely

261
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
pleasant. um you know even even when um

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
you know people might find it

263
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
frustrating or things like that. I think

264
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
a lot of in families cooking is

265
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
something that learning how to cook

266
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
which has both tactile and kind of

267
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
scientific ma you know measurement

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,959
mathematical language components um that

269
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
people often find quite pleasurable. Uh

270
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,720
and this connects a lot to like the

271
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,320
material I'm learning in CMS 587 about

272
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,680
assessments. We're learning like the

273
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,519
different theories of intelligence and

274
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,519
how um if you believe that your

275
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,120
intelligence isn't fixed and like it can

276
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,560
expand then you can learn a lot more.

277
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
And that's kind of like young children

278
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
or babies because they're not really

279
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
afraid of failure and like they just

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
like they're very resilient. So yeah.

281
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Yeah. Yeah. They don't they don't care

282
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,839
what's going on. They're just trying to

283
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,160
figure things out. Um how many of you

284
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,680
have have had uh experiences that you're

285
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,600
really happy with where learning was

286
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,240
hard where you like persevered through

287
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
sort of a challenging set of learning

288
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,640
experiences and got better at it and you

289
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,880
were like, "Yeah, that's great. I'm

290
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
super glad I did that." What what things

291
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,640
come to mind for that for you? I think

292
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
for me learning to code was a bit like

293
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,200
that. I think differently from some

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
people in the room like I didn't learn

295
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,240
to code in middle school. I learned it

296
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,399
in university. So there were like

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
degrees associated with it and things

298
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,360
like that. Yeah. Yeah. You watched a

299
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,040
bunch of lectures and did pet sets and

300
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,120
turn them in and but I remember like the

301
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
first very complex pet that I completed

302
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,760
and like my program worked perfectly and

303
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,200
I was like it's amazing feeling. It felt

304
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
it felt very satisfying even though some

305
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,240
of the learning experience of doing

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
that. Yeah. Yeah. So that that kind of

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,160
that you know I think there's sort of a

308
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,160
moral story that emerges around a lot of

309
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,680
instructionist learning which is like it

310
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,760
was hard we put our nose to the

311
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,600
grindstoneone we sacrificed but after

312
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
that sacrifice we had this great feeling

313
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,079
of relief and I think most of us have

314
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
some kind of learning experience that

315
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,120
goes like that and then situated

316
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
learning people have more of this story

317
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,000
of like we just naturally found

318
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,440
ourselves in this space surrounded by

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,560
opportunities to learn and it was

320
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,000
playful and it felt easy and natural and

321
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
that's what we're trying to sort of

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
restore So actually the cognitive load

323
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,160
theorists have to me what I think is

324
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,839
sort of a funny way of dealing with

325
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,839
this. Um there was just a guy who

326
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,680
proposed that there's two categories of

327
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,920
things that are learned called

328
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,959
biologically primary and biologically

329
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,680
secondary kinds of things. Um and uh

330
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,920
we're evolutionarily wired to naturally

331
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,200
learn biologically primary kinds of

332
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,800
things and everything else is

333
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,160
biologically secondary and is much

334
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,240
harder. So that you're sort of naturally

335
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,240
wired to learn how to walk, how to eat,

336
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,560
some basic parts of socializing,

337
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,399
recognizing faces. Language ends up

338
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,800
being a real problem for this because

339
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,880
it's like are you biologically primed to

340
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
learn your first language to learn

341
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,200
multiple languages? Why would you be

342
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,680
biologic? Like why was it easy for me to

343
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,959
learn English when I was young, but not

344
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
Spanish was really hard when I was

345
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,839
older? Like my brain changed? Did

346
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,760
evolution? Like anyway, um I actually

347
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,680
find this theory totally unsatisfying.

348
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,920
Um do do you are familiar with the idea

349
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,120
of epicycles? Um like before the

350
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,200
capernican revolution uh we uh everybody

351
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,880
thought orbits were circles not you know

352
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,399
uh ovals or or whatever it is that

353
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,600
they're what is it? What's the shape of

354
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,519
them? Ellipses. Um and so there was a

355
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,120
period of time when they realized like

356
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
oh circle measurements don't work. And

357
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
so they added circles to the circles. Um

358
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,279
there they like believed that there had

359
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,560
to be sort of perfect circles making the

360
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
orbits. And so they believed that

361
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,800
somehow there were like orbits within

362
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,480
the orbits. um you know and then I think

363
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,519
it was capergus who came around was like

364
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,880
actually it's just like this and that

365
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,959
works a lot better but to me sort of

366
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,480
biologically primary and biologically

367
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,760
secondary thing sort of operate that

368
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
like that seems a little bit like an

369
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
epicycle to me like we haven't quite

370
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,959
figured out um what's going on there but

371
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,639
that is how um canonically the the

372
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,720
cognitive load theory people just wave

373
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,399
all this away and say ah but babies

374
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,160
whatever biologically primary we don't

375
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,839
have to worry about them um everything

376
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,079
after you're four years old or something

377
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,839
like that is uh cognitive load theory

378
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,160
works um But for the situated learning

379
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,360
people, you know, not not exactly, but

380
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
in a lot of ways, they're trying to sort

381
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
of recapture the learning experiences

382
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,040
that we have when we're very young. Um,

383
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,240
where where learning is natural,

384
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,800
playful, not always happy, but often

385
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,560
sort of socially satisfying. Um, and

386
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,399
extremely effective. I mean, what babies

387
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,560
learn in a short period of time is just

388
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,320
bonkers. Um, it's one of the most fun

389
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,800
things about being a parent or an auntie

390
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,160
or a uncle or all the other ways you get

391
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:25,680
to spend a lot of time with kids. Okay.

392
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,680
Um, let's just get oriented

393
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,160
here. So, again, we're in foundations.

394
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,040
Um, we're trying to get a hand of these

395
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,320
two sort of contemporary learning

396
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,760
theories. Cognitive load theory,

397
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,160
situated learning. Um, that these two

398
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,160
ideas about how people learn are

399
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,839
ancient. Um, that you can find people

400
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,279
like Plutarch for the mind does not

401
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,040
require filling like a bottle, but

402
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,959
rather like wood. It only requires

403
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,639
kindling to create in it an impulse to

404
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,800
think independently and an ardent desire

405
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,440
for truth. That's the sort of like this

406
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,120
is Plutarch making a case for situated

407
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,160
learning and against cognitive load

408
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
theory, though he wouldn't have known

409
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,680
those terms because they didn't show up

410
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,680
for another 2,000 years. Um, but you can

411
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,880
hear the resonance of the debate in his

412
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,360
mind. Here's a little chunk from a 2017

413
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,279
New Yorker article. For nearly a

414
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
century, public education in America has

415
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,480
been influenced by two opposing

416
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
pedagogical approaches. Traditionalism

417
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,519
and progressivism. The thing that you

418
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,959
got to catch is that there are these two

419
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,959
ideas that have like each of them has

420
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,800
8,000 different names. But anytime you

421
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,240
sort of notice this dichconomy, broadly

422
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
speaking, in the traditional approach to

423
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
education, a teacher imparts knowledge

424
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,279
to students through direct instruction

425
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
and embodies a disciplinary culture in

426
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,959
which obedience is both prized and

427
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,560
rewarded. That's a that's a nice both

428
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,560
like so like she frames it here's a

429
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
pedagogical piece. Knowledge is imparted

430
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,320
through direct instruction and embodies

431
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,240
a disciplinary culture in which

432
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
obedience is prized and rewarded. like

433
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,519
obedience was not prized and rewarded

434
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,480
amongst the baby on the playground. What

435
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
was rewarded was screwing around. Um the

436
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,279
purpose of the classroom is to equip all

437
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,800
students to meet measurable academic

438
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
standards. At progressive institutions,

439
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,160
a teacher develops a curriculum but

440
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
urges students to treat it as a staging

441
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,959
ground for their own intellectual

442
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
discoveries, often through hands-on

443
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,920
activity and group work. Allowances are

444
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
made for differences in the way

445
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,839
individual students learn. Progressivism

446
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,519
was inspired in large part by the work

447
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,680
of John Dwey, the American philosopher

448
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,800
and education theorist. Um maybe I'll

449
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,160
say that last name. For Dwey, the

450
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
classroom was not simply a place for

451
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,160
acquiring academic credentials. It was

452
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,959
also a venue in which students learned

453
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,720
crucial values about being citizens in a

454
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,639
democracy. So maybe maybe these things

455
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,199
are laden not just with pedagogical

456
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:32,160
ideas, beliefs about human architecture,

457
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,760
um cultural sort of values, but even

458
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,880
maybe the outcomes of education. Maybe

459
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,279
we believe differently about that,

460
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,800
though not necessarily. Um the person

461
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,199
who's probably the best counterpoint to

462
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,600
John Dwey is this guy Ed Thorndikeke. um

463
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,040
who is a very early educational

464
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
psychologist. I often think of him as

465
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,040
the guy who is like no no no pale

466
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,399
filling is great. Um like a particularly

467
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,399
great thing about pale filling is that

468
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,920
we can measure pale filling. You can

469
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,360
measure like the rate at which you bore

470
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,759
things into people and the rate at which

471
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
it falls out and how leaky people are um

472
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,440
and some of those kinds of things. So he

473
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,440
was very involved in testing. Um he

474
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,480
actually um played a really important

475
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,959
role in developing ideas that

476
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,399
educational progressives uh hold dearly.

477
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,759
He's one of the things he studied which

478
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,079
we'll talk about the course goes on is

479
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,560
this idea of transfer. Um so uh uh you

480
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,000
know in the 18th 19th century people in

481
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,639
America Europe believed that a great

482
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,600
thing about learning Latin and Greek was

483
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,440
it sort of strengthened these kind of

484
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,199
like generic thinking muscles. Like if

485
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,800
you got really good at learning Latin

486
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,199
and Greek you would just be a good

487
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,880
thinker. And he was like that's dumb. Um

488
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,399
if you learn Latin and Greek you're good

489
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,240
at Latin and Greek but you're not

490
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
actually good at anything else. um like

491
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,399
the brain is not general purpose like

492
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,800
that but that kind of thinking that kind

493
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,639
of thinking if I learn this thing it'll

494
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399
help me like generically with these

495
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,800
other things shows up all the time. Um

496
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,160
the most contemporary uh version of this

497
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,639
is have any of you ever encountered the

498
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,079
idea of computational thinking. What

499
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,279
people mean by computational thinking

500
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,600
almost all the time is like we're going

501
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,880
to teach you computer programming and if

502
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
you learn about computer programming

503
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,559
you're going to learn how to like break

504
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,280
ideas down into smaller parts and you're

505
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,959
going to learn how to think

506
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,319
algorithmically and do all these other

507
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,880
sort of and it's like no you're going to

508
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,079
be good at programming computers. Um you

509
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,319
know if you want to be able to break

510
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,839
ideas down in poetry learning computer

511
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,439
programming will not help you do that

512
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,799
anymore. I mean it will help you about

513
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,160
as much as learning Latin and Greek will

514
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,319
help you do that which is to say like

515
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,839
not that much. um that a frustrating

516
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,799
thing about teaching is the things we

517
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,840
learn um tend to only help us in like

518
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,440
very near cognate areas. Um so these are

519
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,480
sort of the two kind of you know again

520
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,679
I'm trying to give you the sense that

521
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,080
like these two big ideas are millennia

522
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,080
old. They have a scientific basis that's

523
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
at least a century old. Um and you're

524
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,559
getting what I think are some of the

525
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,240
best most recent contemporary uh

526
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,440
formulations. Um like the work of John

527
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,880
Sweller and some of these other folks

528
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
like the little piece you read from

529
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,240
Mitch Resnik for today. Um and then

530
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,360
maybe just to give you like a broader

531
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,520
overview like overwhelmingly Thorndikeke

532
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
is one. Um if you were to walk through a

533
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,960
typical American school in a typical

534
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,799
American day, you would see very little

535
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,039
education is life itself and you would

536
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,280
see a lot of direct instruction. Um like

537
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,240
the the canonical experience of students

538
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,240
in schools is very organized around

539
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,200
direct instruction. However, if you were

540
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,720
to ask teachers who their favorite um

541
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,799
educational philosopher is, you would

542
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
get a lot of answers that are Dewey and

543
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,039
you would not get a lot of answers that

544
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,280
were Thorndikeke. Um so the um Dewey is

545
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,799
beloved in a way that Thorndikeke is

546
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
not. But Thorndikeke is like actually

547
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,280
the person who uh inspires more of our

548
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
ideas. All right, let's do just a little

549
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
bit of close reading together, which is

550
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,080
mostly me telling you about some things

551
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,320
that you should read closely. This is

552
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,640
what we looked at yesterday. Here's um

553
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,039
one thing that's fun about the um

554
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,120
cognitive load theory people is that

555
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,440
they have they're really good at stating

556
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,840
clearly what their models of human

557
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
cognitive architecture are. I think the

558
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,320
situated learning people have cognates.

559
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,919
I think they have things that they

560
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,400
believe are central about the brain, how

561
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
learning works. Um but they would draw a

562
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,039
different model like this is not what

563
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,799
they were draw and and but and they're

564
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,400
less explicit about it which makes our

565
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,480
job a little bit harder but a thing that

566
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,960
you can be thinking about now um is like

567
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,080
what would be you know what is the what

568
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,840
is the situated learning cognate of this

569
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,280
like what would be the pieces that they

570
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,880
would put in the model that would be

571
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
most important um for their

572
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
developmental learning. We'll play with

573
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,160
that as we go along a little bit. Okay.

574
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,160
Um how many of you ever use the logo

575
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
programming language?

576
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,919
Oh good. More than there. How many of

577
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
you use Scratch? Okay, there we got

578
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,919
everybody. Um, so Scratch is a

579
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,679
descendant of Logo. Um, Logo is a

580
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,840
programming language that was uh

581
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,480
developed by Seymour Papert um in the

582
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,000
media lab. Uh, one of the first efforts

583
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,480
to bring computer programming to um kids

584
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,720
in schools when I was in the fourth

585
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,840
grade at a monastery school in South NIC

586
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
not far from here. We had a little

587
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,520
computer lab and logo was the language

588
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,080
that I learned to do a little bit of

589
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,200
programming anyway with um you'll see

590
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,280
that a lot of it um is about shapes and

591
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,640
geometry. Um but what I really loved

592
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,880
about it was uh choose your own

593
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,559
adventures. Um so you could essentially

594
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,720
like like write a program or function

595
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,320
whatever it is in which uh someone types

596
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,880
a word and that triggers the the display

597
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,000
of a set of text. Um, and so it wasn't

598
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,360
that hard to make choose your own

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,280
adventures, you know, you know, like

600
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
you're you're you're at the front of the

601
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,640
house. Do you want to walk up to the,

602
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,080
you know, type porch if you want to walk

603
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,280
into porch? Um, type, uh, knock if you

604
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,039
want to knock on the door. And then

605
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,400
knock is a program that releases another

606
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,159
set of text and you can make choose your

607
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
own adventure that way. How important is

608
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,400
that for you to know? I don't know. Here

609
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,200
um is a few minutes of Seymour Papert

610
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,880
um who was a student of Jean PG who's

611
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
another kind of major social

612
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,679
constructivist sort of thinker. Here's

613
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,240
um what uh logo was supposed to look

614
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,480
like in the classroom in the 1980s about

615
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,280
when I was a kid.

616
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,280
The idea is quite

617
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,120
simple. Let learn mathematics by

618
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,240
speaking in mathematics about things

619
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,000
that really matter to him. So at MIT,

620
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,280
we've given computers the power to turn

621
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,880
motors, to make sounds, to draw

622
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,559
pictures, and we've found ways of giving

623
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,840
children the power to control the

624
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,600
computer. So the child can make the

625
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,840
computer do anything that he can

626
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,720
describe in a suitable mathematical

627
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,720
language by typing on a keyboard like

628
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
this.

629
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,159
That's what um P1 sounds like.

630
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:50,200
[Music]

631
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,200
P2. That's P2 and P3.

632
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,760
[Music]

633
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,159
A computer controlled turtle is made to

634
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,000
draw and dance by programs so simple

635
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,840
that all children invent them in the

636
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,159
first days of the course. Thus, the

637
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,159
child acquires a taste of math power

638
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,799
that grows and grows as his projects

639
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,000
become more original, more complex, and

640
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,000
more varied. So, you have like the um

641
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,760
first one, then the second one, then the

642
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,480
third one, then the first one again for

643
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,520
the ending. Okay. Now they'll put their

644
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
little tunes together to

645
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:35,300
[Music]

646
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,760
make now. I'm telling it to do it.

647
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,480
I know.

648
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,200
Sometimes I get into bugs like this and

649
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,880
it'll

650
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,840
um when it was doing it in his mind, the

651
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,400
little turtle, it's the little triangle

652
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:08,080
thing um was on an angle. So it drew the

653
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,240
picture on on an angle. So now I'll go

654
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,480
back and have it draw it in its mind

655
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
again while it's in the right position.

656
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,000
And so the child doesn't have to be told

657
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,440
by a teacher whether he's right or

658
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,120
wrong. He can see for himself whether it

659
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,039
works. That's what science and knowledge

660
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,960
is about. Super procedure is named

661
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,760
fancy. And then you have an input which

662
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,320
means you can vary the size. I'm going

663
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,320
to make it

664
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,679
100. Right now it's doing a procedure

665
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,559
called

666
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:45,440
top. And each one of those little fins

667
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:49,840
is called fin. And that's another sub

668
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,000
procedure in top. Now it's doing inside.

669
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,159
They are identifiable techniques for

670
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,320
working on a problem. One of these is

671
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,360
known by these children as writing

672
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,960
procedures as subrocedures. Inside and

673
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,200
top are the two main

674
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,960
subprocedures and the other one the tail

675
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,520
is made out of odds and ends. just put

676
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,559
just put together the techniques really

677
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,480
well known. Subdivide the problem. Split

678
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,600
the

679
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,080
difficulties. Make a procedure out of

680
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,919
subprocedures. Make a whole I'll just

681
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,240
tell you one second about this little

682
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,679
robot which again is like iconic my

683
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,799
childhood. I I had a commercialized

684
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,080
version of this. Um but it it t it it

685
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,440
takes the same commands and uses the

686
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,559
same language as the turtle that's on

687
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
the screen. So you can tell it like

688
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,360
forward 10 and there's some equivalent

689
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,039
to forward 10 that also shows up on the

690
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,799
screen. It has a pen that's mounted in

691
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,200
it that's controlled with pen up and pen

692
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,039
down. Um, so you can like make varying

693
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,559
kinds of shapes using that. And then if

694
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,919
you see the cable that the person is

695
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,600
walking around with, that was a serial

696
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,880
cable which is the primary thing we used

697
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,960
to use to connect computers to

698
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,360
peripherals. So that like before

699
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,640
wireless or before you know USB or other

700
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,640
things like that that was the cable that

701
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,480
they were using to move things around

702
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,480
procedure out of sub procedures, make a

703
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,520
hold out of parts. Understand each

704
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,159
separately. Everybody knows that, but

705
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,679
they don't do it. Now, it's moving

706
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,000
across the screen the way I um told you

707
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,840
it did it before, but this time, this is

708
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,400
like the way I taught myself to get it

709
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,039
across the screen. It's the first time I

710
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,240
had done it. And so, the way I have the

711
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,120
little one to go is every time it moves

712
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,600
up a little, it subtracts a number, a

713
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,000
little bit of a number, and then until

714
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,600
it it's a small number. And when it's a

715
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,279
certain number, I tell it that it should

716
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,440
stop.

717
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,200
Martha's getting mathematical knowledge

718
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,960
in a meaningful context for use. Now,

719
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,640
it just told me I can't move off the

720
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,799
screen. When I was at school, they told

721
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,039
me to learn long division because I

722
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,240
would need it when I grew up. And I

723
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,240
think I knew it was a

724
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,360
lie. It was to make me despise the

725
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,159
teachers a little more. Now it's drawing

726
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,120
the

727
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,440
gill a

728
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:09,159
subrocedure. Now the bottom of the fish

729
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,320
Steven is using the ideas of angle of

730
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,880
subrocedure of arc and of circle in a

731
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,279
confident purposeful way. The tail the

732
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,720
triangle part is made out of a procedure

733
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:27,039
called try one. First you got to do

734
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:30,960
right 60, then forward 50, back 50, left

735
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:35,720
60, forward 50, back 50, left 60,

736
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,720
forward 50, back 50, and so on.

737
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,559
Now it's doing a

738
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:46,640
firm. That's a radius of 300 and a um

739
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:50,559
arc of 90. I made a big radius. And then

740
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,120
I went sector left which will go right

741
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,960
over it and bring it back. Then I made a

742
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:00,080
smaller radius of the same arc and then

743
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,000
it would do that again. Then it's even

744
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,279
smaller one. It will do that again. And

745
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,840
that's how I got the

746
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:10,640
fern. There we are. There's the finished

747
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,360
picture.

748
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,679
I made a big song and I used that for

749
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,760
part of it and then I made an

750
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:23,400
accompanying with it with the drum and

751
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,400
that's um

752
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:44,550
[Music]

753
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,760
The kids told me that's a spiral. I

754
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,400
think there was a new mathematical word

755
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,430
that was born there that's going to

756
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,489
stick. I'd call that real discovery.

757
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,489
[Music]

758
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,159
Good. Don't spend time with this. Um,

759
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,200
turn the people next to you. Talk to

760
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,720
them a little bit. What are what are the

761
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,000
things that you saw in there that coher

762
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
with ideas that you read about from

763
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,960
other communities of situated learning?

764
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,960
What are some things that you saw in

765
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,200
there that cohered with cognitive load

766
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,039
theory? Do you see sort of evidence of

767
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,880
direct instruction that was in there

768
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,039
anywhere? Um and then what kind of

769
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,120
learning environments have you been like

770
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,559
um where you learned in this kind of way

771
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,760
that was pleasurable? And have people

772
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,880
been in learning environments where

773
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,159
you've sort of learned in this way that

774
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
you found very unpleasurable and

775
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,200
unlikable? Then discuss that for a

776
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,399
couple minutes. Ready? Go.

777
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,159
Every good. What are what are what are

778
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,559
some connections that people made? What

779
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,799
are some things that uh where you saw

780
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,200
examples of uh situated learning or

781
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:45,039
cognitive load theory or things that

782
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,200
seem pleasurable or or frustrating? What

783
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,960
did you talk about in your groups? We

784
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
were talking about learning like

785
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,039
programming in general or it seems like

786
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,480
you always need some base level of

787
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,240
whether it's the instructions or knowing

788
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,399
whatever commands there are in logo and

789
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
that most likely comes from more of an

790
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,480
instructional place but then you can get

791
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,240
into these situations like we saw in the

792
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,440
video where it becomes open world but it

793
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,039
still seems like you need some base

794
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,559
level where CLT needs to come in. All

795
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,000
right. Yeah. Or or some kind of direct

796
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,399
instruction. Where where did where what

797
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,840
what evidence of direct instruction did

798
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,600
people um did people see? Like where

799
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
were you like h that kid didn't figure

800
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,279
that out on their own? I mean just the

801
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,039
terminology they figured out like

802
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,320
procedure subrocedure all of these

803
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,919
things are a kid a kid wouldn't just

804
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,600
figure these out. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't

805
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,279
seem like Steven came up with the term

806
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
procedure and subrocedure. Like pretty

807
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,480
sure somebody taught him you know sat

808
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,000
down and said this is you know here are

809
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,360
a couple of useful definitions that will

810
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,440
allow us communicate with us more

811
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,200
clearly. Um also we were talking about

812
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,480
like when the two girls were talking to

813
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,080
each other it was like one at the

814
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,399
beginning was like instruct instructing

815
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,159
the other. Yeah.

816
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,000
So, I guess that's kind of like Oh, very

817
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,360
direct instruction. Yeah. Instruction

818
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,480
within like a situated learning

819
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,240
environment. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's

820
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,600
it's Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a kind of

821
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,919
worked example like, oh, I'm going to

822
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,279
show you how I you know, I made a thing

823
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,279
like I'm going to, you know, we're going

824
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,720
to make this thing together right now by

825
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,760
first of all, play each of the pieces.

826
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
Now, we're going to play all the pieces

827
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,399
together. I've already learned how to do

828
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
that. you know what makes it a kind of

829
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,720
peer learning uh uh situated learning

830
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,240
kind of thing is it's one young person

831
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,159
teaching it to another person but does

832
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,399
seem to be you know direct instruction

833
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,159
for sure. Um that kind of led us into a

834
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,399
conversation about how like within

835
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,559
situated learning like that there's like

836
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,080
kind of two ways that it can be seen as

837
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,480
like you have someone who's like an

838
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,960
old-timer like the the other girl like

839
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,520
explaining to the other the like the

840
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,279
other girl about um the situation that

841
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,279
they were working with. But then there's

842
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,279
also the instances when it was just like

843
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,960
the student and the computer and that

844
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,480
like you kind of lost that like social

845
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,480
aspect that you have of like learning

846
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,679
from another person. Um and then we like

847
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,840
went into like an interesting

848
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,320
conversation about whether like maybe

849
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,760
the student was like having a social

850
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,080
interaction from themsel and like

851
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,200
learning with the computer as a tool or

852
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,880
maybe they were having a social

853
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,240
interaction with the computer itself and

854
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,240
like they were learning from the

855
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,159
computer and the computer was like

856
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,640
learning what like they really wanted

857
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,159
the outcome to be. So yeah. Yeah, good.

858
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,520
Yeah, that's definitely something we'll

859
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
think about more as we go along. Like

860
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,600
what kind of agent is the machine? What

861
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,720
kind of relationship do we have uh to

862
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,480
the machines? How does the machine

863
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,720
motivate? How does the machine explain?

864
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,799
The thing that seems pretty rad here

865
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,559
that that seem more pepper is the

866
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,200
machine gives some great feedback.

867
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,279
Although lots of other things do. Um uh

868
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,039
hand drills give great feedback. You

869
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,399
know, when you like go through the wall,

870
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
you know it. And when you like, you

871
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,960
know, hit something metal or something

872
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,880
like that, you know it and you get that

873
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,360
kind of instant feedback. Um there are

874
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,279
other things that we teach people where

875
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,679
it's just hard to imagine where that

876
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,679
instant feedback might come from. Um

877
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,880
writing is often that way especially

878
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,640
like writing other people. There's

879
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,240
nothing that a sort of screen right we

880
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,919
haven't built things very well where a

881
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,000
machine can tell you like oh that's a

882
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,600
compelling way of expressing that idea

883
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,480
um in the same way that I can be like oh

884
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,600
my swan is on its side. Um so sort of

885
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,000
different you know different

886
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,919
technologies or and different in you

887
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,600
know different things that we study have

888
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,880
have different capacity to give us

889
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,080
immediate feedback about what we're

890
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,039
doing. Um good other has anybody ever

891
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,679
been in an environment like this where

892
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,120
you're like oh my gosh this is the worst

893
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,679
do students have experience in this kind

894
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,840
of like open-ended learning where you're

895
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,919
like this is terrible. Yeah, I remember

896
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,159
this like one or I guess the some more

897
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,919
recent MIT experience where basically

898
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,519
one of the classes like final project

899
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,440
was very like open-ended and they were

900
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,360
like, "Oh, like just like design this

901
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,799
game." And I was like, "Wow, like it

902
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,159
would be nice to get some kind of Yeah,

903
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,760
will you please show me how to design

904
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,760
this game? Like I don't like someone has

905
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,440
figured this out before. Like I don't I

906
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,720
don't want to explore this space

907
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,480
forever." I've definitely have people

908
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,600
who who have taken this class and they

909
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
watch this video and they're like, "Give

910
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,640
me a break." Like just show me how to

911
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,279
use the turtle. them. Um I would say in

912
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,159
high school um a lot of the AP computer

913
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,399
science classes are like very into like

914
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,000
this kind of situated learning. But then

915
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,720
if you have certain classrooms where

916
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,320
like in my instance it was like just

917
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,840
overloaded with people who just need an

918
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,279
elective and they were like you have to

919
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,640
take this class then it becomes that um

920
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,320
like peer-to-peer interaction becomes an

921
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,159
issue where it's like okay you have

922
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,399
three people who are trying to teach

923
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,919
like 30 other people how to do a

924
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,320
specific thing because you're in the

925
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,399
same like group and they have to pass

926
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,760
and they don't really care anyway. Good.

927
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,200
people have different motivations or I

928
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,799
mean a huge problem that computer

929
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,399
science education has is that people

930
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,240
unlike other subjects people come to it

931
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,240
with very different levels of background

932
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,000
experience. Um so like none of you

933
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,440
probably ever took a geology class where

934
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,440
like a third of the kids were like man I

935
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,200
just love geology like I do I do geology

936
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,559
all the time in my spare time. I'm way

937
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,519
ahead of you guys. But that is

938
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,519
essentially what just about every

939
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,120
computer science class we teach is like

940
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,279
where a chunk of people are like way

941
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,559
into it know a bunch more already. Um,

942
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,200
and in fact, those open-ended

943
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,440
environments can be can be really great

944
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,039
for those folks who have that extra

945
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,600
expertise, and they can be a real bummer

946
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,200
for people who like can't jump in as

947
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,000
naturally. Harmon, what was you going to

948
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,960
say? Uh, I think what this made me think

949
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,519
of is how CLT and situated learning

950
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,480
cannot be really separated from each

951
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,720
other. Sometimes you need CLT to give

952
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,440
framework for students and then from

953
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,520
that I guess you can fire the wood and

954
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,119
the situated. Yeah. Good. Good. I like

955
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,399
it. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. What are the

956
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,839
I think that's a great question to ask.

957
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,919
What are the different sort of

958
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,760
combination and permutations like the

959
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,599
reason why these ideas have existed that

960
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,839
we can find evidence of them for 2,000

961
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,760
years is that like they both seem pretty

962
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,960
good. Um they both seem useful in

963
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,359
different ways. You know, here you know

964
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,520
here is here you know um Seymour Papard

965
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,839
is once talking about like his teachers

966
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,440
lying to them and despising schools. But

967
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,320
you can also find sort of school things

968
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,480
like we're going to need some

969
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,000
definitions that I teach you um that are

970
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,639
kind of woven even in this sort of

971
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,639
extreme example. Um let me give you a

972
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,800
few pieces from the thing that you read

973
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,040
u from a guy named Jean Le um who with

974
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,440
another person named Eddiad Winganger um

975
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,520
really advanced some of these ideas. Um

976
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,839
and I want you to like be thinking about

977
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,000
like so how is the like what are the

978
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,359
methods that this person uses to study?

979
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,960
What are the kind of arguments they

980
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,359
make? What are the implications for

981
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,839
pedagogy? what's their framework about

982
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,680
um human beings and how they learn and

983
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,280
where do these things lap and overlap

984
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,040
you know some like it can often seem

985
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,079
like when you're writing about you know

986
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,520
if you read a bunch of stuff on

987
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,040
cognitive load theory it seems like

988
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,200
they're just talking about instruction

989
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,880
and they mostly are but they're ways at

990
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,520
talking about instruction that evoke

991
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,839
their beliefs about culture that evoke

992
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,280
their beliefs about values that evoke

993
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,480
their beliefs around methods and

994
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,720
outcomes even if they don't talk about

995
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,200
those things as much in this chapter I

996
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,800
propose to consider learning not as a

997
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,440
process process of socially shared

998
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,599
cognition that results in the end in the

999
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,240
internalization of knowledge by

1000
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,880
individuals but as a process of becoming

1001
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,599
a member of a sustained community of

1002
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,680
practice. Um so anytime you read

1003
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,520
anything a thing that you're almost all

1004
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,119
probably trained to do is try to figure

1005
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,400
out like what is the person's core

1006
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,480
argument like what is the thing they're

1007
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,480
arguing for. An equally useful thing to

1008
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,920
do almost anytime you read anything is

1009
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,160
to try to figure out what is this person

1010
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,200
arguing against. Um, and people are

1011
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,520
often not that explicit. Um, you know,

1012
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,599
he's not sort of saying like these jerks

1013
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,440
who are really like big on schools and

1014
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,280
direct instruction have totally missed

1015
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
this stuff. But there's that's kind of

1016
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,640
what he's he's getting at in here. And

1017
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,880
it's and it's a radical statement.

1018
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,320
Learning is not the internalization of

1019
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,240
knowledge. You know, last week I told

1020
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,320
you that for some of these kind of

1021
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,079
educational psychology people, memory is

1022
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,160
the residue of thought. Like the entire

1023
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,960
end point of cognitive load theory is to

1024
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,920
store memories facts as memories in our

1025
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,119
long-term memory. Um not as the

1026
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,880
internalization of knowledge as

1027
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,960
individuals but as a process of becoming

1028
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,440
a member of a sustained community of

1029
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,720
practice developing an identity as a

1030
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,040
member of a community and becoming

1031
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,440
knowledgeably skillful are part of the

1032
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,920
same process. You cannot separate

1033
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,440
storing things in long-term memory from

1034
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,240
building relationships with other

1035
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,920
people. Um with the former motivating

1036
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,920
one of the key things that we remember

1037
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,760
our colleague Michael Pashan you know

1038
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,599
not a theory of everything where is the

1039
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,359
motivation with the former motivating

1040
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,520
shaping and giving meaning to the latter

1041
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,960
which it subsumes it is difficult to

1042
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,880
move from peripheral to full

1043
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,720
participation in today's world including

1044
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,240
workplaces and schools thereby

1045
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,359
developing knowledgeably skilled

1046
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,200
identities. This is because the

1047
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,200
processes by which we divide and sell

1048
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,560
labor, which are ubiquitous in our way

1049
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
of producing goods and services,

1050
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
including knowledge, truncate both the

1051
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,680
movement from peripheral to full

1052
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,040
participation in the scope of

1053
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,839
knowledgeable skill. Taken to an

1054
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,760
extreme, these processes separate

1055
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,680
identity from intended forms of

1056
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,200
knowledgeable practice. This view

1057
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,040
implies that learning and failure to

1058
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,880
learn are aspects of the same social

1059
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,320
historical processes and points to

1060
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,320
relationships between knowledgeability

1061
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,960
and identity as important focus for

1062
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,400
research. These jerks, these education

1063
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,839
psychologists keep trying to convince

1064
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,079
you that what learning is is just

1065
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,000
shoving stuff in your brain. It's not.

1066
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,280
There are always people around when

1067
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,560
we're learning. Even when we're learning

1068
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,320
by ourselves, reading books and stuff

1069
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,680
like that, there are people in our minds

1070
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,160
or communities that we see ourselves

1071
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,119
being part of. Um try, you know, trying

1072
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,640
to understand how learning happens in

1073
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,000
schools or any other learning

1074
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,920
environment without thinking about the

1075
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,960
social environment that people learn is

1076
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,320
bonkers, is nuts. Um, it just it it it

1077
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,240
denies a crucial part of our humanity.

1078
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,359
Um, here's a a blog post that you can

1079
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,880
look at later if you sort of follow

1080
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,599
this. It's by a wonderful math educator

1081
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,920
named Dan Meyer. Um, who has been trying

1082
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,240
to explain to people why he thinks AI

1083
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,359
chat bots are a stupid idea and will not

1084
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,440
work. Um, and and uh and the you know

1085
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,440
his core issue is like nobody wants to

1086
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,040
talk to a computer. Like maybe the

1087
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,440
computer can provide a sort of perfect

1088
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,800
direct instructional sequence, but like

1089
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,640
the kids who are in my eighth grade

1090
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,240
algebra classroom, they don't want to be

1091
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,720
there. They're not interested in

1092
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,680
algebra. Um I love this framing. He's,

1093
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,960
you know, he a students attend school to

1094
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,040
answer two questions. Who am I? And how

1095
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,480
do I do this? Those are the two things

1096
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,119
they're thinking about all the time. Who

1097
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,280
am I? And how do I do this? A chatbot

1098
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,440
cannot help you at all with the first

1099
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,800
question. Um but the other thing I want

1100
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,760
to bring up here and you can disagree

1101
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,160
with that and we'll talk about more when

1102
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,680
we talk about chatbots but um who am I

1103
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,160
and how do I do this? This is exactly

1104
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,920
what Jean La was discussing that

1105
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,320
identity cannot be separated from the

1106
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,240
acquisition of knowledge. Um and I think

1107
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,599
most of you probably if you think of

1108
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,960
your own classroom exper you know think

1109
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,160
of your own school experience like I

1110
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
spent a lot of time in middle school and

1111
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,359
high school thinking to myself in one

1112
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,640
form or another who am I? Um what do

1113
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,240
people think of me? What kinds of

1114
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,839
relationships do I have? Why am I here?

1115
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,280
What am I supposed to be doing?

1116
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:30,079
Um uh Jordan has carried out extensive

1117
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,680
field research in the Yakatan Maya wavel

1118
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,200
whose apprenticeship is quite different

1119
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,040
more effective and less exploitative

1120
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,760
than the butchers of marshall study. The

1121
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,000
apprentices are peripheral participants

1122
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,760
legitimate peripherence and legitimate

1123
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,040
peripheral to the practice of midy. What

1124
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,520
did you all take away from what you

1125
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,880
think like what is legitimate peripheral

1126
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,680
practice or periphery? Like what does

1127
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,280
that mean sort of in your own words?

1128
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,599
What do you think Dana? Like they're

1129
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,440
doing work that like matters, but

1130
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,119
they're not like doing the main work.

1131
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,200
Like they're doing side tasks that are

1132
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,119
like helping them understand the main

1133
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,720
process, but like they themselves are

1134
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,880
not like giving birth to the child.

1135
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,160
Good. Good. And and there's a space

1136
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,560
there. A space is held for those people.

1137
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,079
It is expected that there are going to

1138
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,640
be some folks who are hanging around

1139
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,560
midwives who are not quite midwives yet.

1140
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,880
And that's normal. They're supposed to

1141
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,320
be there. Um, it's not a classroom of 20

1142
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,079
people all lined up who are supposed to

1143
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,359
be doing the same thing all the time.

1144
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,480
There's supposed to be some people in

1145
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,240
the middle and there's supposed to be

1146
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,760
some people on the outside. I want to

1147
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,079
pose a question too to think of the

1148
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,359
relationship between what uh Gene Le was

1149
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,680
talking about the midwives and the

1150
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,440
butchers in the thinking. What's the

1151
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,640
difference between peripheral

1152
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,680
participants and legitimately peripheral

1153
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,240
participants? Do folks remember what

1154
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,240
they described about the butchers? Yeah.

1155
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah. Yeah. Was that the butchers even

1156
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,880
though like they were doing peripheral

1157
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,599
work, they were separated in space from

1158
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,319
the like

1159
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:58,000
the experts. So they didn't they

1160
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,000
wouldn't really pick up on things as

1161
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,119
opposed to midwives who still observe

1162
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,960
what the legitimate the expert was

1163
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,040
doing. Yeah. So what does that mean in

1164
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,720
terms of being a part of that community

1165
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,920
and then shaping the learning that

1166
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,680
they're able to

1167
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,800
acquire? If I'm a butcher and I'm I'm

1168
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,319
part of the community, if I'm standing

1169
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,880
over here cutting my meat, using my

1170
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,560
tool, that's all I get to do. And then

1171
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,160
Justin's over there, you know, hanging

1172
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,359
out with the pig or whatever it is,

1173
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,280
right? What am I losing then? The social

1174
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,200
aspect. The social aspect, right? Am I

1175
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,640
able to observe him? Can I see what he's

1176
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,560
doing when he leaves? Can I pick it up

1177
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,000
from watching? Totally miss that. But

1178
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,160
then what about the midwife? How's that

1179
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,520
different?

1180
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,880
How do they describe the midwife

1181
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,040
relationship? Justin, I hope this is

1182
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,000
okay. I love this book. So, yeah. Go

1183
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,839
ahead. Um, so I think the one of the

1184
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,680
main differences is beyond the fact that

1185
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,079
it wasn't supposed to be more efficient.

1186
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,920
So there was no capitalist aspect to it.

1187
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,720
There was a lot of culture embedded in

1188
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,800
it. So like the daughter of a midwife

1189
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,240
would become midwife, meaning that at 5

1190
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,280
years old, they would already kind of be

1191
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,280
present in that situation and start like

1192
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,440
picking up on what was going on and then

1193
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,560
progressively have a more like

1194
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,079
protagonist role to that experience. So

1195
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,839
yeah. So like although both could be

1196
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,359
argued as peripheral, right? We're we're

1197
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,200
in the same space. We're hanging out.

1198
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,560
Like who's welcome in the community and

1199
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,880
then what type of knowledge are you able

1200
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,319
to gain from that type of peripheral

1201
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,839
participation? It's kind of cool. It's

1202
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,079
subtle, right? Yeah. All right. That's

1203
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,839
all I got. I have Can I make Okay.

1204
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:31,920
um the the previous paragraph I had a

1205
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:36,800
lot of reflection about it and I don't

1206
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,480
nec like kind of that in some aspects

1207
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,400
I'm not sure how you feel about it but

1208
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,760
like I really like the point that he

1209
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,160
makes about like learning kind of makes

1210
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,319
forms your identity as part of this

1211
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,079
social group right and I think that

1212
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,160
really applies to kids for example kind

1213
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,480
of like they come from this per

1214
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,640
peripheral existence and develop their

1215
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,560
own identities and become like a

1216
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,040
committed like functioning part of

1217
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,280
society. But then it really made me

1218
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,760
think like oh how do we think about it

1219
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,839
like from an abbleist um perspective

1220
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,839
right where people cannot acquire

1221
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,079
certain knowledges or certain abilities

1222
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,160
and does that mean they have less of an

1223
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,400
identity like I really thought about

1224
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,000
that for a while and at the same time

1225
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,079
there's like a criticism in the book

1226
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,319
about like commoditization of knowledge

1227
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,560
because before like with midwives etc

1228
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,640
like okay it was this really specific

1229
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,520
group of people teaching this very kind

1230
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,040
of like expertise u whereas today we

1231
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,960
have universities and we have schools or

1232
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,280
you can kind of get to whatever class

1233
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,079
and learn things, but it's not

1234
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,440
necessarily all bad, right? Because that

1235
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,359
would imply that if you're the daughter

1236
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,599
of the midwife, you don't really have a

1237
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,200
lot of say into becoming or not a

1238
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,440
midwife, right? Like the way that

1239
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,800
society was structured back then likely

1240
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,640
you would kind of become one because

1241
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,000
that's what expected of you. Whereas

1242
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,560
like when you kind of can choose that

1243
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,040
you have some sort of agency and power

1244
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,280
even if you won't have that exposure as

1245
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,760
a peripheral participant since a since

1246
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,680
you were a kid. So like it really made

1247
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,960
me think of many things. Great. Good.

1248
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,359
Good. And and none of them have to be

1249
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,079
resolved either. Um you know that that

1250
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,040
uh um probably probably some important

1251
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,880
things to take away are like how Jean

1252
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,400
assigns values to these different kinds

1253
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,079
of institutions. like he thinks it's a

1254
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,160
big problem, you know, a big problem

1255
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,720
with schools and university is sort of

1256
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,800
ripping knowledge away from these

1257
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,359
broader social contexts. Um that you go

1258
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,000
and take a physics class and in the vast

1259
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,920
majority of physics 101 classes, no one

1260
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,440
is trying to get you to be a physicist.

1261
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,119
They're not trying to get you to develop

1262
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,640
the identity of a physicist. They're

1263
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,400
just trying to teach you the physics.

1264
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,760
And what is lost sort of in that? Of

1265
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,839
course, what's pretty rad about like

1266
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,040
walking into a campus full of people who

1267
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,400
will be like, "Yeah, I'll teach you any

1268
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,839
of these atomized little things for you

1269
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,800
to learn." like that seems kind of cool

1270
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,480
too. Um it is worth noting that it would

1271
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,119
be difficult to find evidence that

1272
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,880
teaching is the mode of knowledge

1273
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,319
transmission amongst the midwives. Um he

1274
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,319
makes this claim that like you wouldn't

1275
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,400
find direct instruction amongst the

1276
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,319
midwives. Um I mean Jordan did the fil

1277
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,720
work and not me. That seems totally

1278
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,160
laughable to me. I've spent time with

1279
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,920
lots of people of lots of ages, learns

1280
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,440
lots of kinds of things and people are

1281
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,200
always transmitting and explaining

1282
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,280
stuff. It's always sort of nested in

1283
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,960
there. Um but there's a kind of politics

1284
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,480
of John Lave like we don't even need to

1285
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,920
explain these things. We don't even need

1286
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,359
to teach these people. We can learn it

1287
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,960
just like babies learn it sort of in

1288
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,079
their natural environment. You just you

1289
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,520
know just like you have to surround

1290
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,920
babies with language and they'll learn

1291
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,440
language. You surround young girls with

1292
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,720
birth and pregnancy and they learn

1293
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,800
midwiffery. Um

1294
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,560
uh apprenticeship happens as a way in

1295
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,079
the course of daily life. It may not be

1296
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,680
recognized as teaching effort at all.

1297
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,839
Again sort of doubling down like there's

1298
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,520
no instruction here. If there

1299
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,839
instruction, the people are lying to you

1300
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,440
and you should despise them. Um, a Maya

1301
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,960
girl who eventually became a midwife

1302
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,040
most likely as a mother, a grandmother

1303
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,720
as a midwife. Girls in such families

1304
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,359
without being identified as apprentice

1305
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,800
midwives absorb the effence of midwife

1306
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,560
practice as well as specific knowledge

1307
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,240
about many procedures simply in the

1308
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,839
process of growing up. They know what

1309
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,440
the life of a midwife is like, what

1310
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,040
kinds of stories the women and men who

1311
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,640
come to consult her tell, what kind of

1312
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,480
herbs and other remedies might be needed

1313
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,839
to collected. As young children, they

1314
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,280
might be sitting quietly in their

1315
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,960
corner. As their minister mother

1316
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,800
administers a prenatal massage, they

1317
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,480
would hear stories of difficult cases of

1318
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,400
miraculous outcomes and the like. As

1319
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,920
they grow older, they may be passing

1320
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,160
messages, running errands, getting

1321
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,680
needed supplies. A young girl might be

1322
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
present as her mother stops for a

1323
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,040
postpartum visit after the daily

1324
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,720
shopping trip to the market. Eventually,

1325
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,640
after she has a child herself, she might

1326
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,240
come along to her birth, perhaps because

1327
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,680
her alien grandmother needs someone to

1328
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,440
walk with, and thus finds herself doing

1329
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,040
for the woman in labor what other women

1330
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,560
had done for her when she gave birth.

1331
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,000
That is, she may take a turn at

1332
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,760
supporting the laboring woman.

1333
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,599
Eventually, she may even administer

1334
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,200
prenatal massages to the selected

1335
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,640
clients. At some point, she may decide

1336
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,560
she actually wants to do this kind of

1337
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,640
work. She then pays more attention, but

1338
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,560
only rarely does she ask questions. Her

1339
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,960
mentor sees their association, primarily

1340
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,560
one that is of some use to her. Rosa

1341
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,800
already knows how to do a massage, so I

1342
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,640
can send her if I'm too busy. Um, that

1343
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,800
is just a beautiful description of kind

1344
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,319
of legitimate peripheral participation,

1345
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,079
moving from the periphery to the center.

1346
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,839
You just watch this thing for a while

1347
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,000
and then your mom's hands are a little

1348
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,839
sore and so you do the massage this time

1349
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,520
and you know how to move the massage cuz

1350
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,280
it happened to you. You've seen it a

1351
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,760
zillion times. Are any of you part of

1352
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,880
sort of clubs or groups at MIT that have

1353
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,880
learning that feels like this?

1354
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,520
I guess like technically a lot of

1355
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,640
theater clubs are similar where people

1356
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,000
are just doing this like how do you

1357
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,079
become a stage manager? I don't know.

1358
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,520
Look at what the stage hand. Oh, and and

1359
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,280
the other thing is like you start as a

1360
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,640
stage hand like Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come,

1361
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,319
you know, you watch some theater. Yeah.

1362
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,160
You know, just stand there and like

1363
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,720
you're like between the second and third

1364
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,079
act like hand this prop to that person.

1365
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,680
Um and you're probably never going to

1366
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,040
take stage manager class. You're just

1367
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,720
going to hand that prop once and then

1368
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,160
you're the prop master and then the

1369
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,359
stage manager gets sick and you do it

1370
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,960
for the night and then you're the stage

1371
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,319
manager. Yeah, I think theater has a ton

1372
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,520
of stuff like this. That's a great

1373
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,920
example. What are you going to say,

1374
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,599
Omar? In the tech and technique, we have

1375
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,960
what's called like shadowing. So, when

1376
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,480
we go out for photo assignments where

1377
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,960
there's a studio photography assignment

1378
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,800
or something out in the field, um we can

1379
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,160
always have like a someone shadowing us

1380
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,920
and they can also be taking photos with

1381
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,680
their own camera and sometimes we will

1382
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,000
use their work as well. So, they can

1383
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,160
also do legitimate periphery work. I

1384
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
love it. and you have intentionally sort

1385
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,760
of held space for that. You've kind of

1386
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,680
designed like, oh yeah, come, you know,

1387
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,040
come along, hang out with us. Um, and

1388
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,319
you probably have parties and other

1389
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,520
kinds of things like that where it's

1390
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,559
like, oh, you know, where like some of

1391
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,079
you are just goofing around, but some of

1392
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,920
it you're like, ah, the story that we

1393
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,839
gota d, you know, I'm sure like them

1394
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,680
telling the stories of of difficult

1395
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,760
cases and miraculous outcomes. I'm sure

1396
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,680
the tech has other similar kinds of

1397
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,599
difficult cases and miraculous outcomes.

1398
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,359
I was going to say like on sports teams

1399
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,960
like when people become captains like

1400
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,960
not often is the coach sitting them down

1401
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,720
and being like this is how you be a

1402
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,640
captain, this is how you lead people.

1403
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,880
It's more like they just like naturally

1404
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,559
have this like personality of doing that

1405
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,720
of like maybe they grew up and like

1406
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,480
their their mom was like a girl boss or

1407
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,559
like they like just grew up seeing stuff

1408
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,800
like that. So then like you kind of have

1409
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,880
like that natural progression into like

1410
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,000
just learning by doing. Good. Yeah.

1411
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,680
Yeah. Pretty. What were you going to

1412
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,240
say, Sabrina? Okay, this is kind of a

1413
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,319
dumb example, but I like I'm really bad

1414
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,319
at Smash, so I always get placed with

1415
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,480
the best Smash player, and then we're on

1416
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,720
a team against two other people who are

1417
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,880
also really good, but this person is so

1418
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,040
good that like they carry they carry,

1419
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,920
but I'm kind of learning along with

1420
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,520
them. Um, and like I kind of like hold

1421
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,680
off onto the side where I just kind of

1422
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,480
like try to like hold lives while they

1423
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,160
like destroy the other people. Um, and I

1424
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,960
think that's kind of periphery. Oh yeah,

1425
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,400
yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean in and in that

1426
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,160
particular community it's a space of

1427
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,480
legitimate peripheral participation

1428
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,800
which somewhat exists because of this

1429
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,800
like fairness balancing kinds of things

1430
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,200
and so you know like every learning

1431
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,240
environment like the substance of uh

1432
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,760
Super Smash Brothers determines like

1433
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,119
where the legitimate you know and it

1434
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,880
determines spaces for peripheral

1435
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,559
partition that's different than

1436
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,480
journalism that different than sports

1437
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,000
that different but this theory is giving

1438
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,440
us commonality where we can talk about

1439
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,720
really different things that might arise

1440
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,160
in different circumstances be like I I

1441
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,000
think that's actually kind of the same

1442
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,200
thing and it's kind of spaces that I'm

1443
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,880
finding for learning.

1444
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:13,280
Um, in short, when official channels

1445
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,040
offer only a possibility to participate

1446
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,720
in institutionally mandated forms of

1447
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,920
commoditized activity, genuine

1448
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,079
participation, membership, and

1449
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,920
legitimate access to ongoing practice of

1450
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,839
a practice considered worthy to the name

1451
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,680
are rare. Practice is not to be found in

1452
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,200
schools and workplaces. At the same

1453
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,880
time, schools and school-like workplace

1454
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,720
educational enterprises accord knowledge

1455
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,800
skill a reified existed turning it from

1456
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,480
into something to be acquired and its

1457
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,480
transmission into an institutional

1458
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,559
motive. This process generates pressures

1459
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,480
towards the trivializing decomposing of

1460
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,319
forms or activity. The result is a

1461
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,400
widespread generation of negative

1462
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,559
identities of misrecognized or

1463
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,800
institutionally disapproved insistential

1464
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,640
communities of practice. um that some of

1465
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,599
the things that might feel most academic

1466
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,079
might feel less or least identity

1467
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,359
oriented to you. Um because there's not,

1468
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,200
you know, think about like what like

1469
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,640
what degrees here would be like I'm not

1470
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,240
sure there's a way to be a legitimate

1471
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,559
peripheral participant there. Like

1472
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,160
there's a way to learn the stuff.

1473
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,839
There's a way to be taught the discreet

1474
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,839
parts of this course or subject or

1475
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:14,400
major, but I I like I'm not learning how

1476
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:16,280
to be a part of this community. Um

1477
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,520
uh okay.

1478
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:23,119
Um, here are three things that I'll have

1479
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,559
you do together um for five or 10

1480
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,440
minutes, which might involve some

1481
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,359
drawing. Um,

1482
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,680
uh, so grab grab some paper or some

1483
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,520
board space. Um, what see if you could

1484
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,319
draw sort of the equivalent of human

1485
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,839
cognitive architecture. Um, see if you

1486
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:41,839
could draw like just just like just like

1487
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:43,200
you drew these diagrams for um, uh,

1488
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,800
cognitive load theory. What is the

1489
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,559
diagram you would draw for um situated

1490
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,440
learning? Um what is um based on that

1491
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,520
cognitive architecture? Um what is the

1492
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,040
pedagogy that follows? So based on like

1493
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,119
the sort of key fundamental principles

1494
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,880
of of situated learning, cognitive load

1495
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,640
theory said like here's a model of human

1496
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,400
cognitive architecture. Here are series

1497
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,760
of like clearly defined effects. The

1498
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,079
situated learning people are not as good

1499
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,160
as like enumerating in bullet points all

1500
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,760
of their pieces, but it's all in there.

1501
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,599
um what are some of the what are some of

1502
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,599
the like instructional practices that

1503
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,800
follow from this model? Um think about

1504
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,319
those two things and then also see if

1505
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,359
you can sort of recreate some of your

1506
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,440
ven diagrams um of what are the

1507
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,440
categories of things that seem separate

1508
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,400
from um cognitive learning and situated

1509
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,880
learning and what are the things that

1510
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,040
they seem to be quite similar on um or

1511
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,800
quite together on. Um take 10 minutes to

1512
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,240
again grab one person or two other

1513
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,599
people do some drawing, do some

1514
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,800
composing. Feel free to pull up your

1515
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,480
notes from your learning journal where

1516
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,079
you should have done some of this uh

1517
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,960
things. And if any of these questions,

1518
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,480
you don't have to you don't have to

1519
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,839
spend equal time on all three questions.

1520
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,520
If you dive in on one, that's fine. But

1521
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,720
those three should keep you busy for

1522
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,559
eight minutes or something like that.

1523
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,160
Make sense? Ready? You go.

1524
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,839
So, one one thing I love about almost

1525
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,839
all of these drawings is it's kind of

1526
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:58,319
impossible to draw these models without

1527
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,079
drawing other people. Um, that when you

1528
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,400
all developed a kind of human cognitive

1529
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,559
architecture in cognitive load theory,

1530
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,240
you were sort of drawing like one brain.

1531
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,599
And actually like actually most of your

1532
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,280
drawings you didn't even really

1533
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,880
represent the rest of the world. But in

1534
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,079
this model it's impossible not to

1535
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,920
represent the rest of the world and in

1536
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,839
particular other people um because

1537
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,200
learning fundamentally is social and

1538
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,440
your identity is fundamentally

1539
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,200
reflective of your connections with uh

1540
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,520
with other people. So these are good. Um

1541
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,599
you read a little piece of um give P's a

1542
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,079
chance. So four P's from Mitch Resnik

1543
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,839
about projects passion uh play and

1544
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,319
peers. Hopefully, you can now start

1545
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,760
mapping some of these ideas to what we

1546
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,880
talked about the reason, you know,

1547
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,119
projects, kind of open-ended

1548
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,520
explorations, making music, making uh

1549
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,920
funny shape, having a robot draw funny

1550
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,240
shape somewhere. Um, those are spaces

1551
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,640
for open-ended exploration, for doing

1552
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,400
multiple kinds of things. Um, projects

1553
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,400
have more space for peripheral

1554
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,079
participation, like multiple people can

1555
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,839
be making music, even if someone's a

1556
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,960
little bit better at making music than

1557
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:03,200
the other person. um that they are um

1558
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,720
that that learning environments here are

1559
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,240
are driven by interests. Um you know

1560
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,319
there's very little reference in

1561
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,760
cognitive load theory to things like

1562
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,599
well yeah and sometimes the kids don't

1563
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,400
like learning math so they just don't.

1564
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,480
Um although that's very real. Um some

1565
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,760
some of the young w some of the

1566
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,640
daughters and midwives wanted to become

1567
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,640
midwives and some didn't. Um and for the

1568
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,160
ones who did want to become midwives

1569
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,000
they followed that interest and those

1570
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,520
who didn't went and did other things.

1571
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,040
Um, and in these kinds of models of

1572
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,640
learning, that's actually okay and

1573
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,160
really important. We're not supposed to

1574
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,599
make everyone better at everything.

1575
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,720
We're supposed to let people follow

1576
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,880
their interests and get good at the

1577
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,599
things that they want to get good at. um

1578
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,760
that in environments in which there is a

1579
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:47,040
kind of lightness to the environment

1580
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,200
where uh you know lightness play creates

1581
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,119
space for multiple forms of

1582
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,119
participation like like things don't

1583
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,319
have to be optimized

1584
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,920
um to to get to the the you know fastest

1585
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,640
best trajectory for all people. There

1586
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,720
can be like room to to play and mess

1587
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,240
around and try other things. And then

1588
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,079
you know doing it with other people is

1589
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,280
essential as you can see in kind of all

1590
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,920
of these kinds of things you know and

1591
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,079
part of what uh um you know in some ways

1592
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,920
the real genius Jean Leave was a woman I

1593
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,000
misrepresented her as a man before and

1594
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,200
Aaron hopefully corrected me. Um Eddie

1595
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,800
Wanger her partner is a co-writer as a

1596
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,240
guy. Um is is it's not it's not just

1597
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,240
like people hanging out with each other.

1598
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:30,800
we can describe repeated patterns we see

1599
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:34,480
of legitimate peripheral participation

1600
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,319
um of old-timers and newcomers um of uh

1601
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,680
there's lots in Le's work that you

1602
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,440
probably read that was about trying to

1603
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,040
trying to find new language to get away

1604
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,720
from the experts and noviceses because

1605
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,800
it's not ju that's part of it but it's

1606
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,240
not just that um it's our time in its

1607
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,839
community it's our space in community

1608
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,160
those kinds of things so there's some so

1609
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,920
just like in cognitive load theory you

1610
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,599
could say here's a human cognitive

1611
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,760
architecture here's a set of pedagogical

1612
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,440
principles that follow from that. Um,

1613
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Jean Leave can describe these social

1614
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,119
interactions. We can as you can abstract

1615
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,720
from them some models of uh of human

1616
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,400
cognitive architecture and say well okay

1617
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,960
from those models there are some

1618
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,880
instructional principles that follow. Um

1619
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,160
if I were to draw one of these I think a

1620
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,720
thing that I would pay a bunch of

1621
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,599
attention to is that um you know the

1622
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,319
thing in in both learning models like

1623
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,440
you learn what you attend to. Um seeing

1624
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:26,400
is really important. Um, a key insight

1625
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,640
of of uh situated learning is that we

1626
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,040
attend to things that interest us and

1627
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,799
motivate us and where where we find our

1628
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,319
identity and care about like how you

1629
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,760
know if looking at something is

1630
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,359
essential to get people to learn about

1631
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,200
it then we ought to think very carefully

1632
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:43,960
about what motivates us to look at a

1633
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:49,359
thing. Um, uh, T-ball for me is a,

1634
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:51,440
um, a a a canonical example of a kind of

1635
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,760
activity which it would be almost

1636
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,079
impossible to teach primarily through

1637
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,760
cognitive load theory. Um, like it's

1638
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,040
really hard to imagine teaching kids

1639
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,559
baseball where you're like, "All right,

1640
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,520
sit down everyone. Like we're all going

1641
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,359
to watch a worked example of how you,

1642
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,480
you know, hit a ball or like like we

1643
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,160
have to learn the rule book of

1644
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,480
baseball." Like the way we teach kids

1645
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,480
baseball is we're like, "What is the

1646
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,240
fastest way we can get young people with

1647
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,839
limited coordination and no knowledge of

1648
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,000
the rules to play something like

1649
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,359
baseball? How do we get them baseballing

1650
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,200
as soon as we possibly can?" And some

1651
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,319
genius was like, "Don't do the pitching.

1652
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,240
Like, get rid of the pitching. Just put

1653
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:27,520
the ball on the stick and they can just

1654
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,200
hit the ball." Um, it h it it it has

1655
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,599
some kind of cognitive relationship to

1656
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,200
sort of part whole practice um to

1657
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,880
devolving scaffolding and things like

1658
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,720
that. There's a there's a researcher at

1659
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,799
Harvard uh who wrote a book called

1660
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,400
Making Learning Whole. Um where he said

1661
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,319
that that one of the things we can often

1662
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,960
do in curriculum that we underestimate

1663
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:47,200
is get people playing the whole game as

1664
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,240
early as possible. Um you could we'll

1665
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,400
talk about this more, but think about

1666
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,160
like what subjects have you taken in MIT

1667
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,319
that let you start playing the whole

1668
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,559
game as soon as possible and what

1669
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,280
require you to sort of build up lots of

1670
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,520
elementary pieces before you can do the

1671
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,760
thing that that whole discipline does.

1672
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,000
Um but ba baseball instruction in the

1673
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,920
United States like very difficult to

1674
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,480
imagine in a cognitive load theory

1675
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,400
framework. Um like very pleasant for

1676
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,559
millions of young people in a more

1677
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,640
experiential situated kind of way. All

1678
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,799
right. You did this a little bit. Um

1679
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,599
which is good. Here is one thing that I

1680
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:24,240
would like to have in the center of your

1681
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,319
ven diagrams of things that are similar.

1682
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,440
Um this I this is a misconception that

1683
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:29,160
my students have had over the years that

1684
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,680
I want to correct.

1685
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,040
um

1686
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,359
they're the cognitive loads theorists

1687
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,160
and the situated learning people agree

1688
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,920
on what expertise looks like. They agree

1689
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,040
on what high quality practice looks

1690
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,559
like. I don't think you'd find these

1691
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,400
people. They would not disagree about

1692
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,079
what a great body player or a great

1693
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,200
carpenter or a great surgeon or a great

1694
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,640
lawyer looks like. Um they would believe

1695
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,040
that sometimes people think that the

1696
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:56,640
cognitive load theorists want people who

1697
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:58,720
are experts to be really like rigid and

1698
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,720
disciplined and pattern repeating and

1699
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,559
that is not the case. That is not what

1700
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,280
they want as the end point. You know

1701
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:07,040
they they want your cancer surgeon to be

1702
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,359
dynamic and flexible when they cut open

1703
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,960
your belly um and find cancerous tumors

1704
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,799
and are pulling them out of there. Um

1705
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,040
they want poets to be creative and

1706
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:17,119
imaginative. They just think that the

1707
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,680
way that you develop the knowledge base

1708
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,400
that lets you be creative and flexible

1709
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,240
and dynamic and strategic is through

1710
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,520
really disciplined instruction. Um

1711
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,640
because if you don't go through a

1712
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,799
process of really disciplined

1713
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,720
instruction, um it's hard to get good at

1714
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,960
things because no one no one has showed

1715
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,960
you how to do fundamental pieces um in

1716
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,839
clear ways. Um I have a couple

1717
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,000
colleagues, Jal Meta and Sarah Fine. Um

1718
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,839
J still at Harvard. uh s was there for a

1719
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,960
while in his uh was it high-tech high

1720
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,799
graduate school of education for a while

1721
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,240
who said who studied schools a lot

1722
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,400
studied very different schools with very

1723
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,960
different pedagogical philosophies and

1724
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,119
found that across all of them they

1725
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,520
tended to believe that expertise

1726
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,599
consisted of mastery identity and

1727
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,400
creativity that you knew a bunch of

1728
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,079
stuff in a domain um that you developed

1729
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,799
an identity in that domain and that you

1730
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:07,200
were able to do flexible creative work

1731
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,960
um you know a bunch of physics equations

1732
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,319
and when to apply them you feel like

1733
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,640
you're kind of a physicist and a

1734
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,440
scientist and when you need to do

1735
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,040
something novel like build a bridge um

1736
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,640
or launch a rocket or something like

1737
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,559
that, you're not just following steps,

1738
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,520
but you're doing things that are that

1739
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:26,319
are creative um and expressive. One one

1740
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,760
way that I would um I think the

1741
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,520
cognitive load theorists and situated

1742
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,680
learning people tend to imagine

1743
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,319
different pathways at getting at these

1744
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,799
goals. Um, so the cognitive load

1745
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:39,280
theorists tend to think that mastery is

1746
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:44,559
like the starting point. If you know the

1747
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:47,040
stuff, if you can do the pieces, then a

1748
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:49,680
we often most enjoy things that we're

1749
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,040
good at. So like get you good at doing

1750
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,640
things. There's, you know, there's there

1751
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,760
there's there's lots of debates in the

1752
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,240
country right now, we'll talk about them

1753
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,599
some, about teaching kids to read. Um,

1754
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,680
and there's some folks who say like we

1755
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,880
just have to let kids explore books and

1756
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,079
find what they're interested in. And

1757
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,760
there other folks are like, you know

1758
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,079
what's fun about reading is actually

1759
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,000
being able to read. So like teach them a

1760
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,920
bunch of phonics and explain to them the

1761
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,520
basics of how to construct words. And

1762
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,200
that's what makes reading enjoyable.

1763
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,040
That would make people feel like

1764
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,640
readers, you know, not when they have

1765
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,000
like a beautiful library of things to

1766
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,440
choose from, whatever they want, but

1767
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,960
when they can actually make sense of

1768
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,280
what's in there. There's some sense in

1769
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,040
that. Um, you develop some kind of

1770
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,720
identity and then you get then you have

1771
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,559
the opportunity to do creative practice

1772
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,319
that builds that mastery. There are

1773
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:35,040
other people who say start with things

1774
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:38,000
like creativity. Start by getting people

1775
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,960
to play around in the space as much as

1776
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,200
possible so that they're motivated. Um

1777
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,040
so that they say, "Man, like I am a I am

1778
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,720
a this. I want, you know, I'm a I'm a

1779
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,359
baseball player. Like I, you know, I

1780
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,839
swung on a ball on a stick a few times."

1781
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:53,839
Um but now I am a baseball player. Um,

1782
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:56,160
and because I'm a baseball player, like

1783
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,760
in my heart, um, I'll memorize all the

1784
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,200
statistics and learn the rules and go to

1785
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,880
practice, you know, and eventually do

1786
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,920
like really boring learning kinds of

1787
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,079
things. Um, the sort of masteryoriented

1788
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,000
discipline kinds of things, but because

1789
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,920
I know how fun it is to play around in

1790
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,559
this space. Um, what what do you think

1791
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,839
at MIT are the are the subjects or

1792
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,240
courses that you would take that would

1793
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:18,319
be more canonically sort of mastery

1794
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,440
first oriented?

1795
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,880
What are what are the subjects you would

1796
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,799
take that you would like start with the

1797
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,000
smallest pieces or or by contrast if

1798
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:28,119
it's easier? What are the ones that seem

1799
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,119
to be more creativity first?

1800
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,160
I think more like bioheavy classes would

1801
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,520
definitely be like mastery first because

1802
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,440
if you don't understand like the basic

1803
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,200
of cells like you're not getting

1804
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,359
anywhere like you can't go like chapter

1805
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,720
2 without understanding like good. So it

1806
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,760
seems to be, you know, so eventually you

1807
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,440
can do some like pretty rad

1808
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,960
computational biology, biological

1809
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,440
engineering here, but there's not a lot

1810
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,760
in bio 101 where they're like, "Yeah,

1811
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,079
let's like have cells start generating

1812
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,319
novel proteins or things like that." I

1813
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,040
would say most of the general

1814
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,880
requirements like especially like the

1815
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,319
chemistry requirements and the biology

1816
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,839
requirements are like with the hopes

1817
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:08,559
that hey if you learn a little bit about

1818
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,559
this maybe then you become interested

1819
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,119
and want to go further and want that to

1820
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,480
be your major. But yeah, so so which

1821
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,079
which ones do that through like giving

1822
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,920
you a bunch of facts and which ones do

1823
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,079
that by letting you sort of play the

1824
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,079
whole

1825
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,680
game? I mean my understanding is that a

1826
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,520
number of the engineering departments

1827
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,920
like in mechanical engineering you'd be

1828
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,000
more likely earlier in your career to be

1829
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,119
like we're going to build a robot. Um

1830
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,400
and like do you know how to build a

1831
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,599
robot? No. Are you going to be good at

1832
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,880
building a robot? No. You're going to

1833
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,640
build a lousy robot. We're going to let

1834
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,599
you build a crummy robot. and some TA is

1835
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,599
going to put their arm around your

1836
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,680
shoulder and be like, "That robot's

1837
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,640
okay. That robot's only okay because you

1838
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,400
don't know anything about control

1839
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,240
systems." But guess what? Guess what?

1840
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,520
One of our junior classes is control

1841
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,960
systems. You're like, "Ah, I can't wait

1842
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,240
to take control system. It's going to be

1843
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,000
boring. It's going to be like a bunch of

1844
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,599
equations and other pets and things like

1845
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,920
that." But there's a robot that you want

1846
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,920
to drive. Um, the neat program I think

1847
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,760
at MIT is really about trying to create

1848
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,200
a bunch of these like experiential

1849
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,400
experiences. I mean, historically, if

1850
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,480
you were to look at our curriculum

1851
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,920
across MIT, many more things would be

1852
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,520
much more like this. I mean, like our

1853
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,280
math curriculum, I think, is very much

1854
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,799
this way. Like, you're just going to do

1855
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,039
math that other people have figured out

1856
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,559
for years and years, and maybe by the

1857
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,160
time you get to the end of MIT, but you

1858
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,760
might have to wait till graduate school

1859
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,000
that you can do some new math that

1860
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,680
someone else has never done before. Um,

1861
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,240
my uh my wife teaches the material

1862
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,920
science department. Um, and uh some of

1863
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,359
the stuff with like the Breaker Lab that

1864
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,079
they just developed and things like

1865
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,920
that. um where like they did an early

1866
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,079
exercise in one of our classes which is

1867
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,480
build products from the worst possible

1868
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,480
materials. Um so like phone cases that

1869
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,559
were made of sponges and absorbed water

1870
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,760
or um locks that were made of clear

1871
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,440
plastic where you could see all the

1872
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,119
tumblers and things like basically like

1873
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,319
play around with materials, do stuff

1874
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,839
with materials and then you're going to

1875
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,920
take like some super boring really hard

1876
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:53,440
classes but you're motivated to take

1877
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,920
those things. So I think you can look

1878
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,319
across environments um and see how they

1879
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,160
choose different pathways um through

1880
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,599
these uh these different if you look at

1881
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,119
reading instruction in the United States

1882
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,960
there's a huge debate right now about do

1883
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,680
you start with mastery and facts and

1884
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,680
pieces and build up to readers um or do

1885
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,960
you start by exposing people to books

1886
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,680
and letters and words and the things

1887
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,359
they love and and lots of time um you

1888
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,520
know and almost no course of study is

1889
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,880
the answer only one of those things like

1890
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,640
nobody believes you should just do

1891
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,480
creativity I think almost all of our

1892
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,480
subjects like have classes which are

1893
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,920
like okay time to buckle down and learn

1894
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,520
this thing. But we can often think about

1895
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,359
like how we order these things

1896
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,960
differently to produce more motivation

1897
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:35,440
or develop identity or other kinds of

1898
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,839
things like that. Um but again the like

1899
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,799
across different pedagogical

1900
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:40,319
philosophies is almost always the case

1901
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:43,039
that people have a very shared idea

1902
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:45,359
about what expertise is. Um so I think

1903
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,079
even people who you know um are situated

1904
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:50,480
learning folks um you know they like

1905
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,960
they they they don't want you to like

1906
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,039
invent midwiffery a new like they want

1907
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,640
the babies consistently delivered in

1908
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:00,000
safe healthy ways. Um uh so that so it's

1909
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,280
that it's different beliefs about how

1910
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,960
you get there. Um there are efforts to

1911
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,160
reconcile these things which I didn't

1912
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,680
make you read but if you wanted to

1913
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,520
explore a little bit more I'll give you

1914
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,760
an introduction to one of them um in the

1915
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,000
rabbit hole for this week. Ken Kadinger

1916
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,079
has a a couple of things you can look

1917
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,520
at. The the lecture he gives is actually

1918
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,359
the easiest way of getting it. There's a

1919
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,880
video in there. It's quite good. Um the

1920
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,319
knowledge learning instruction framework

1921
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,359
and he says one useful way to think

1922
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:29,119
about this um is that there are um uh

1923
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:30,960
more complex and less complex knowledge

1924
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,880
components in the things we learn. So

1925
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,359
there are things like um you know

1926
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,680
Chinese characters and there are things

1927
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,520
like you know um anthropological

1928
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,160
principles about how society are

1929
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,119
organized um and there different levels

1930
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,559
of complexity. There's also um sort of

1931
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,200
learning processes and there's things

1932
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,440
like flashc cards um and then you know

1933
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,079
which is just for memorizing stuff um

1934
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,680
and then there's things like um talk and

1935
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,240
explaining and sense making and stuff

1936
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:01,359
like that um and he has a theory that

1937
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:04,319
basically um you know you should be

1938
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:07,119
matching instructional components to how

1939
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,880
complex um the knowledge component

1940
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,359
learning processes to how complex the

1941
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,000
knowledge components are. Um he has a

1942
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:16,240
nice uh sort of this is kind of like a

1943
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,599
giant science which is in process where

1944
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,440
here are a bunch of things that people

1945
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,599
were trying to learn. Chinese vocab,

1946
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,359
French articles, chem models, pressure

1947
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,359
concept. Here are a bunch of uh

1948
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:27,280
instructional strategies, optimal

1949
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:29,440
scheduling, feedback, worked examples,

1950
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,680
accountable talk, collaboration and you

1951
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,319
find that like the you know these are

1952
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,359
less complex to more complex teaching.

1953
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:39,839
this is less complex to more complex um

1954
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:41,920
uh uh knowledge components and that like

1955
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,680
basically where you get uh studies with

1956
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,280
statistically significant effects on

1957
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,960
learning is when you kind of move

1958
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,640
through the middle of this space when

1959
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,920
you map the right knowledge component to

1960
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,520
the right learning process. I don't know

1961
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,599
that Ken Kinger and his colleagues have

1962
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,039
totally figured this out either. Um but

1963
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,000
it's one way to start sort of

1964
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:01,599
reconciling some of these ideas. Okay.

1965
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,880
Um the the most important thing for

1966
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,280
Wednesday is that we're meeting at the

1967
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,119
MIT Museum. Please try to be at the MIT

1968
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,039
Museum. Like if you could if you can get

1969
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,240
there by 1 and get checked in and put

1970
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,000
your bag in the locker, then we can

1971
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,680
start class at 105. So make every effort

1972
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,159
to get there as soon as you can. There's

1973
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:18,880
a few pieces of reading. Um the Steven

1974
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:21,040
Wolf thing is totally worth your time

1975
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,159
and it will require a little attention.

1976
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,520
Like you'll have to sort of move your

1977
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:25,040
way through it, but he does just a

1978
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,799
beautiful job explaining the

1979
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,560
fundamentals of generative pre-trained

1980
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,759
models. um a little bit about neural

1981
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,960
networks and things like that. And then

1982
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,319
there's a bunch of other readings that

1983
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,000
are in there. Some of which are about

1984
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,440
the mu the exhibits you'll see at the

1985
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,960
museum and some are some other

1986
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,719
educational things that me and some

1987
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,839
other folks at MIT have written about uh

1988
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,120
GPT. Um and then be sure you refresh

1989
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,319
yourself and you start thinking about

1990
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,920
working on the assignment because you

1991
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,960
now have two of the crucial building

1992
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,880
blocks that you'll need for the

1993
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,480
assignment. Um which is some sense of

1994
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,000
direct instruction, cognitive load

1995
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,480
theory, and some sense of

1996
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,759
constructionism, situated learning, um

1997
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,279
progressive learning kinds of things.

1998
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,960
And you'll need both of those ideas to

1999
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,640
do assignment number one. And we'll talk

2000
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,199
a little bit about uh how we want to do

2001
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,279
assignment number one on Wednesday. Stay

2002
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:06,480
safe in the snow. Have a wonderful uh

2003
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,120
next couple days. And I'll see you at

2004
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,120
the museum on Wednesday.
