1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,800
Good afternoon. Really nice being here.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,280
So my name is Pong. I'm CEO of Movie

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,440
Systems. So at MOI we solve probably a

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,880
very different type of AI problem. It's

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,800
about large scale planning and

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,400
optimization out there in the real

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,160
world.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,400
Um yeah. So really the problem core

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
problem we address is um people have

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,800
been using constraint solvers

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,120
optimization system to solve problems at

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,000
a local scale for transportation for

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,000
logistic for a very very long time. But

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
when you try to expand it as a world

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,040
scale and then you try to compress the

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,640
solution time down from hours to minutes

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,800
to sometimes second in order to

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,840
accommodate for this dynamic changing

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
disruptive world things will fall apart.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,360
But really that's what uh where our

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,840
software address. So really what we end

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,719
up doing is developing a large scale

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,159
planning system that can ingest all type

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,799
of data from inventory for resources for

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,880
mapping for traffic. Anything end up

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
being described in either temporal

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,520
spatial or preferential constraints or

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,280
objective functions. Then we solve that.

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,159
We spend time to solve for the initial

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,640
solution but then continues to receive

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,280
updates in a streaming way. There is a

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,520
flight being delayed. Suddenly 200

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
passengers on board that flights their

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,159
bus route to different hotels in Morca

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
needs to be rerouted. We'll subscribe to

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
that and then start to identify the

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,479
impact automatically and then replan

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
either the route the pick up the drop

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,119
off the bus with who is going to get

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,920
seed all automatically.

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,320
So I want to talk through a um kind of

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,600
workflow we end up deployed our solution

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,960
with TUI the tourism company based in

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,000
Hanover Germany. So they operate about

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,560
12,000 buses of different sizes just

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,759
like the one in the vehicle serving over

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,320
25 million travelers on an annual basis.

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,360
You can imagine traditionally they have

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,759
a fixed solver that operates overnight

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
for about four to eight hours. Their

51
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,920
operation team defines a problem kind of

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,000
plug in all the bookings they receive

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,879
for the next day. The solver get a

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
solution. The operator team then push

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,959
that to a different place where they can

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,879
dispatch it to all the bus drivers. When

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,760
things fall apart, the operation team

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,239
has to go in manually reassign all the

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,000
passengers to all the vehicles and then

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
based on the flight, based on weather,

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
based on equipment failures. That's have

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,040
been changed completely now because we

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,360
are now our system is at center dealing

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,040
with all those hard planning routing

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,440
scheduling problems and then the

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,280
operation team suddenly become the team

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,680
that's just monitoring the results and

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,200
then providing guidance on how we want

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
to shift the different ways in the

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,080
objective function what type of digital

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
business logic we want to support. So

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
you can imagine from there the business

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
impact is very very significant. First

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,200
of all they are the largest travel

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,080
company in the world. So basically

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,760
everything has a huge multiplier but

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
also on that even if when you're just

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,200
looking at the operation metrics we're

79
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
definitely providing better plans

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,360
because we no longer need humans to

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,159
solve constraint optimization problems

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,200
on the spot. We also significantly

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,360
reduce really the solution time for the

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,239
teams to basically respond to any type

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,319
of issues. Maybe previously need 30

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,959
minutes for all the travelers impacted

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,799
by a flight delay to get any plan. Not

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
anymore. those things are really being

89
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,280
pushed out in near real time computed

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,239
automatically by our system subject to

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,560
all those different business

92
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,040
constraints. So coming here we mostly

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,760
want to look for opportunities to

94
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,000
basically expand our software's frontput

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,319
in the transportation logistic base but

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,319
also potentially go forward because we

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,400
know our software works really with any

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,360
type of temporal spatial preferential

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,680
constraints. So for us, every new

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,080
partners we on board to our platform, we

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,319
go through this three-step process to

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,799
make sure that we can truly get the

103
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,799
software and the model customized to

104
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,120
your problem. Making sure we capture

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,519
every single constraint that we need to

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
consider so that we auto solutions that

107
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,280
can be put into the field and execute

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,040
directly. So for us really going beyond

109
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,639
travel, transportation, we definitely

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,440
see opportunity in maintenance and

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,440
repair, disaster response, um shipping

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,880
as well as supply chain field, but

113
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,720
really any other verticals that may

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
utilize the type of large scale planning

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,919
solutions we have. We would like to talk

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,800
to all of you. Thank you.

117
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,120
Thank you,

118
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,120
Pang. Any

119
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,360
questions? Okay, I'll start. Um tell us

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,440
a little more about do you support cloud

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,880
uh native on premises and hybrid

122
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,960
implementations? Um yeah definitely so

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,720
the software itself is cloud native

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,639
because we actually need to utilize

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
right now it's in AWS the autoscaling

126
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,759
capabilities to solve for different

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,840
problem sizes very very quickly but you

128
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,080
can imagine everything ultimately got

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
packaged into either a data streaming

130
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,800
layer or a solver layer that we can just

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,800
deploy as docker images or containers

132
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
into any public or private cloud

133
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:25,520
environments. Any questions?

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,960
Cool. So, we'll have a booth outside.

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,840
Looking forward to talk with all of you

136
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,840
later. Perfect. Thank you.
