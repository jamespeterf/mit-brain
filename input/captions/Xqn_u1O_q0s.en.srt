1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,279
so this is the article I want to say

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,640
just a few little things about it that

3
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:25,199
um it's it's an article that was written

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,160
for um for other academics at the time

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,560
so just just so we know that it wasn't

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,040
at the time it was published in 200 for

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,079
really designed that we're going to read

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,480
it in class and we're going to have

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,879
various academic articles in here so

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,200
some people are old hats reading

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,039
academic articles in the humanities or

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,520
in or in science or in this case at the

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,520
intersection of humanities and Science

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,800
and other people had less um less

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,280
introduction to that so I just want to

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,760
take a minute and say how I approach

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,519
reading a new article because we'll have

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,120
some of them um first all always take a

19
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:07,080
second and think about the the title for

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,759
a second figure out okay is you know

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,799
sometimes I even just write it down and

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,960
put it somewhere because uh when I'm not

23
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,640
assigning articles there are things that

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,159
you can put down at any point and so

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,119
when I get to the point where I'm

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,720
somewhere through it and I see they're

27
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,079
not answering they're not talking about

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,799
the title they're not answer then I can

29
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,840
throw it away uh you're not allowed to

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,040
do that in this class but that's you

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,920
know sign to do then I always start

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,479
paying attention to the Bold points and

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,320
try to see about that because uh I don't

34
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,520
read very fast and things so I'll want

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,320
to jump ahead a bit but always read the

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,000
introduction really carefully I would in

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,520
some ways if you have you know let's say

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
this would never happen to you but

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
you're behind on a reading or something

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,680
it's 10 minutes before class and you're

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,479
trying to figure out what to do um don't

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,560
read the whole thing fast read the

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,680
introduction really carefully twice and

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,840
that's um because that's what almost

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,160
everything should be there if it's a

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,440
good article we may read U because

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,280
you'll get to very specific things in as

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,760
you get to your projects we may get to

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,840
the point where you're kind of assigning

50
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,480
yourself articles or it's like hey look

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,920
at this these five articles that I may

52
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,080
have seen um if at the end introduction

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,480
again you don't know anything what it's

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,800
going to be about throw it out move to

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,000
the next article but um a well-written

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,560
article should give every

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,040
there I go to the pictures yet next I

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,879
don't want to ever see that cliche of

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,959
pictures with thousand words in any of

60
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,560
your things but it's kind of true so you

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,040
can figure out okay what are we going to

62
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,280
be talking about um from reading the

63
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,319
introduction I knew we're going to be

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,200
talking about music representation so I

65
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,720
start asking are these music

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,920
representations that are been talked

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,159
about and then when I look at the text I

68
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,599
can do it I can see okay the next topic

69
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,000
is issues representation I've skimmed

70
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,720
ahead so I know there's only uh two real

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,760
topics in this so this should be the

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
first half of it oh my gosh like that's

73
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,080
why we remember

74
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:14,159
like um okay um and read the first

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,159
sentence the first paragraph of that and

76
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,200
go ahead and see if

77
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,200
um if the if the ending tells you what

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,159
it's going to be about it's this is not

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,319
like watching your favorite movie don't

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,159
an academic article you shouldn't feel

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,080
like you're spoiling the the great

82
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:37,560
reveal um there there's maybe five

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,799
articles in my life where I think if I

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,920
did if I read this way the first time I

85
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,959
saw it I would have ruined the article

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,439
all the rest I just improved my so I can

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,760
see that um okay so we have a problem of

88
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,519
multiple requirements and we have some

89
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,400
sort of a solution that doesn't work so

90
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,040
that I can go back and read and try to

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,439
figure out what it is we're going to be

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,680
talking about and we can see the final

93
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,319
um thing is an introduction to the next

94
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,439
section you see that the second part is

95
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:11,840
a case study of one particular example

96
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,720
of computational and comparative

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,919
comparative and computational

98
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,560
musicology and um I can see okay I

99
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,919
probably should have some fun looking at

100
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,000
that later and then jump to the

101
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,080
conclusion and this article's great in

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,720
that it does label its conclusion with

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,880
where is it the word conclusion um not

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,880
every article does that but again

105
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,080
um go ahead and read the last couple

106
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,800
paragraphs of the article so you find

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,080
where it ends go back and go ahead and

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,919
figure out what the article is going to

109
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,120
be

110
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,560
about when you're assigning articles to

111
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,280
yourself and and the Articles just keep

112
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,400
getting longer um it's this weird thing

113
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,520
that people used to write things in

114
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,160
typewriters double spaced in Courier 14

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,039
point now we write single spaced in

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,360
Times New Roman 11 or 12 or something

117
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,320
and but people keep thinking that my

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,759
article needs to be 30 pages long and

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,639
that's actually double the length of

120
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,000
Articles so uh they're starting to get

121
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,800
too long I do encourage you to read like

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,759
this and then only only after you figure

123
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,120
out what the

124
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:34,199
main s conclusions of the article are

125
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,000
um this one is pretty obvious to those

126
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,840
of us in this class that you can use

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,360
computational methods without giving up

128
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,080
to gistic values only once we've done

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,440
that um we go back uh hopefully you can

130
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,520
skip notes the first time you read

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Because if they've written well these

132
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,759
should be additional parts or places

133
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,720
that you can look at later um if it's a

134
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,960
poorly written article then you have to

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,400
read the notes to get to it

136
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,160
and if it's a new subject go ahead and

137
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,759
look at the references and see who

138
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,440
appears a lot so you can see okay these

139
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,560
are probably important people okay this

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,919
guy paulon hipple hipple hereon here on

141
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,440
here on here on on here and I should

142
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,080
probably if I want to go further read

143
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,680
something by here this what I'm think

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,479
yeah was just more more and more of them

145
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,599
and um and then also if there's anybody

146
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,199
that we recognize from the class and

147
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,160
will you'll be looking at El Sil Fields

148
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:41,199
writings today she's

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,319
awesome I'm going so with this in mind

150
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,360
these are some of the strategies that I

151
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,639
go through in in looking at it and then

152
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,520
the other great strategy is talk to

153
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,599
people and hopefully um they can give

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:07:00,639
you the their tape on the article and

155
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:00,639
again we can you know be richer for it
