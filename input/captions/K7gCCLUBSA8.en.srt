1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,639
okay so good

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,039
morning but we finally got to the heat

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,279
interaction so we're almost uh

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,320
comfortable with the old ideas of uh

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,800
thermodynamics being the the theory of

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,320
uh heat and

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,320
work we did

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,120
temperature um usually there is also

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,719
another thing that maybe I didn't stress

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,719
enough

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,840
uh

12
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,840
usually you taught that thermodynamics

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:59,719
deals with large amounts of uh

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,719
substances many particle systems

15
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,680
but you see that um if you went to the

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,479
seminar yesterday suggested if you're

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,799
going to the seminar by Professor Howard

18
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,799
Stone uh who is a very important name in

19
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:21,280
in fluid mechanics and uh you'll see

20
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:25,280
today that uh much of current interest

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,439
is in small devices

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,560
microfluidics uh

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,240
bacteria floating on uh

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,560
um Solutions trying to find food or

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
other

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,119
things few

27
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,320
particles in some extremes like in the

28
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,880
quantum thermodynamics only very few

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,759
particles maybe

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,200
one whereas in the fluid mechanics of of

31
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,840
small systems it's it's few but not so

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,200
few nevertheless it's not many so these

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,119
are not macroscopic systems so you would

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,680
Wonder well H does thermodynamics

35
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:11,400
apply okay this is precisely the reason

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:15,360
why I'm postponing the part that deals

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,519
with many particles in other words all

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,319
that we have done so far if you noticed

39
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,360
didn't require require any assumption

40
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:27,519
about the number of particles so all the

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,959
things that we do also today until uh

42
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:34,480
maybe the next or the next uh

43
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,680
other uh lecture does

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,519
apply to microscopic and mesoscopic

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,519
systems right so this is important

46
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,360
because if you do if you if you work

47
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,200
downstairs in the atopos microfluidics

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,640
lab or if you do research in

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,640
biology at some point you're going to

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,159
have to uh even if you are an

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,200
experimentalist you're going to have to

52
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,599
make a model of your experiments if you

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,319
are a theorist you start from the model

54
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:10,560
if you're an experiment theist you want

55
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,519
to uh correlate your data and you need a

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,560
model usually to do

57
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,640
that and therefore what we are doing

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,400
which is of course a lot of theory a lot

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,159
of

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,840
equations

61
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:29,319
but is exactly what you need to do this

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,959
modeling so that's the motivation for

63
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:36,280
this course

64
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:39,040
it's it's timely also because uh

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,599
it's it's one of the few ways of

66
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,239
presenting thermodynamics in such a way

67
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:49,519
that in it starts from generalities that

68
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,519
hold not only for macroscopic

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,799
systems okay me just uh review quickly

70
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,720
what we did last time we defined heat

71
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,519
interactions

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,799
so a heat

73
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,959
interaction was defined as one in which

74
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,680
a

75
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:14,319
system two systems A and B initially at

76
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,320
uh stable equilibrium

77
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,600
States exchange energy and

78
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,400
entropy but they do so in such a way

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,400
that even if you

80
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,639
put uh in between them some Machinery

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,120
that tries to separate the the energy

82
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,160
transferred into

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,759
uh into two streams one of which is pure

84
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,919
is work so it's just pure energy and no

85
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,520
entropy that machine will not succeed so

86
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,759
no no fraction of the energy exchanged

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
can be recognized as

88
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,400
work so

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,199
heat

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:03,120
is the extreme the the farthest non-w

91
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:07,639
work interaction hardest from work most

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,960
distinguishable from work and that

93
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:14,240
definition uh leads to the condition

94
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,240
that the two systems to have a heat

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,240
interaction must be at almost the same

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,680
temperature if not the same

97
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,240
temperature because only in that limit

98
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
the carau ratio between the two

99
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,919
temperatures which represents the

100
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,759
fraction of the energy that could be uh

101
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,160
uh identified as

102
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,840
work goes to

103
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:42,080
zero okay we also mentioned

104
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,720
that in spite of the usual understanding

105
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,560
that uh heat is uh the energy transfer

106
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,000
between bodies at different

107
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,080
temperature uh and therefore seems to

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,520
contradict what our

109
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,080
definition we notice that if uh the

110
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,800
standard model that we adopt in a heat

111
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,800
transfer is a local uh equilibrium or

112
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,080
quas equilibrium

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,199
model whereby the

114
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,880
system is divided in in smaller

115
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:21,919
systems that are modeled as being near

116
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,199
equilibrium not at equilibrium

117
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,360
like highlighted

118
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:31,560
here uh near near equilibrium and

119
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,560
therefore in that way

120
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,360
first of all you could assign the

121
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,599
temperature of the of the equilibrium

122
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,800
state that they these elements would

123
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,280
reach if you isolate them from the rest

124
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:48,800
and just let them relax to

125
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:52,000
equilibrium and uh and second um

126
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,599
the on the eever Suess

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,879
diagram we notice also this is important

128
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,680
and we'll return to this uh the heat

129
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,080
interaction

130
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,319
on one

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,520
side um pulls the pulls the system in a

132
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,520
in a direction that uh so on the eers

133
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,479
sucess

134
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:18,840
diagram if I'm here and I'm going to

135
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,240
inject uh both energy and

136
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,520
entropy that's the direction in which my

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,039
state will

138
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,440
move and if another interaction

139
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,960
injects uh the same energy

140
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,879
uh but takes away I'm sorry takes away

141
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:43,280
energy same energy but takes away more

142
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,919
entropy then it goes that way and the

143
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,520
two are not aligned so in order to align

144
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,400
them to to keep the state at steady

145
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,360
state so so that the state doesn't move

146
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,240
you need also something and that

147
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,840
something is

148
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,520
uh is another Vector which which is uh

149
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,520
representing the entropy produced by

150
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,960
irreversibility so you need a

151
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,759
irreversibility to

152
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,720
keep fluid element or a solid element in

153
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:20,240
a uh steady state when subjected to a

154
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,800
gradient in temperature so that means a

155
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,879
temperature difference between one side

156
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,639
and the other

157
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,279
side

158
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:35,519
okay so let's do something new

159
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,080
now not very new but it's another

160
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,240
another it's

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,800
similar um to what we have done when we

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,600
proved the conditions for Mutual

163
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,760
equilibrium between

164
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,200
systems this time

165
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,080
though we are not applying the maximum

166
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,720
entropy principle but we apply are

167
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,760
applying the principle of entropy non

168
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,760
decrease in weight processes

169
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,800
and let me say it again the principle of

170
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,320
entropy non

171
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,480
decrease is for weight processes or for

172
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,040
systems that are isolated in other words

173
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,160
it's impossible to decrease the entropy

174
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:25,040
of an is of an isolated system or a

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,720
system that under goes only a weight

176
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,680
process otherwise it is possible to

177
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,839
decrease the entropy like we do here

178
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,560
like heat interaction is precisely the

179
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,800
kind of interaction that allows to

180
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,600
extract entropy from a system

181
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,480
right all

182
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,640
right so here the idea is that we start

183
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,920
from a composite system of two systems A

184
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,920
and

185
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:59,519
B at different

186
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,519
temperatures this time they're different

187
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,800
and we uh ask ourselves is it possible

188
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:11,720
when is it

189
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:14,600
possible for them to exchange energy and

190
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,680
volume so through

191
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,680
a movable

192
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,600
partition so here is the initial State

193
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,920
and on the E sucess diagram for the

194
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,920
composite system I denoted by this point

195
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,800
here

196
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,800
and here's the final State same energy

197
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,760
and same volume so it's on on the same

198
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,560
energy line for the composite system but

199
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,560
internally some energy has gone from a

200
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,839
from A to B so for example if de is

201
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,079
greater than

202
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,760
zero uh the energy of a is increased so

203
00:10:52,079 --> 00:11:00,399
the energy has flown from uh B to

204
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,480
a or if DV is greater than zero

205
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:09,079
uh the volume has increased so that

206
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:12,920
again system B has Lo lost volume for

207
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,920
the gain of volume of system

208
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,519
a what we apply here is a condition that

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,120
since this is a system is isolated so a

210
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,760
particular case of a weight process with

211
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,200
no external effects

212
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:33,800
uh the the entropy can only

213
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,519
or remain zero if the if the process is

214
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,920
reversing

215
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,360
so the final

216
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,639
entropy of the composite must be greater

217
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,200
than the initial and so we have this

218
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,560
inequality here S2 greater than S1 which

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:55,800
we write this way which we write this

220
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,720
way then the tools are the same that we

221
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,880
already used we use

222
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,800
additivity we use

223
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,800
the

224
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,800
fundamental

225
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,680
relation remember now here your system

226
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,040
system a starts from a stable

227
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,480
equilibrium State we want to extract or

228
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,600
to uh let's

229
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,240
say change with a negative

230
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,880
de the the

231
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,519
energy and so at the new level of energy

232
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,079
there are many states that can be

233
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,720
obtained so I'm trying to explain the

234
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:44,399
reason for this less than or equal to

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,399
the change in entropy for system a

236
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,399
is either this one but it can also be

237
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,399
less I mean I'm sorry

238
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,519
more

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,720
okay and the same for B

240
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,519
so we end up with this relation

241
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,519
here and so these things must be greater

242
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,199
than

243
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,199
zero because these are all

244
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,279
connected so now we can still uh choose

245
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,560
some special

246
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,560
cases for

247
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:30,440
example uh suppose we don't change the

248
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,959
volume so the Piston is uh

249
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,279
it's it's blocked by a

250
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,079
stop uh or there is no Pistons this is

251
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,839
just a

252
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,320
wall then DV is equal to zero so this

253
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,040
contribution isn't

254
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,320
there and suppose we want to transfer

255
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,880
energy from B to a so that de is greater

256
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,040
than zero here it

257
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,800
is so if this is greater than zero then

258
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
this term in parenthesis must be greater

259
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
than

260
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:10,560
Zer and that hopefully will say that t1b

261
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:15,199
must be greater than T1 a

262
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,279
if in a process without external effects

263
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,079
some energy is transferred in the

264
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,720
direction from B to

265
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,759
a we we we we say this in words by

266
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,360
saying

267
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,120
that uh the

268
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,079
temperature or

269
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,199
better somehow or equivalently the minus

270
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
the in the negative of the inverse of

271
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,920
the

272
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,800
temperature can be understood as an

273
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,440
escaping tendency for

274
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,839
energy so if you have two systems that

275
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,680
have the different escaping energies the

276
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,959
one who manages to give energy to the

277
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,440
other is the hotter one the one that has

278
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,440
a higher escaping

279
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,560
tendency all or we could

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,360
choose suppose we choose that the two

281
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,480
systems A and B are initially at the

282
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,680
same

283
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,079
temperature so this term in parenthesis

284
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,079
isn't

285
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:21,600
there and we want system a to acquire

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:26,759
volume at the expense of system B all

287
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:31,199
right so T the denominators here are

288
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:35,120
equal uh and so we find that P1 a must

289
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,120
be greater than P1 2 B me sorry this

290
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,880
should be also one

291
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,279
one this should be ones I have to

292
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,279
correct

293
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,880
that so

294
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:56,319
that's so you can interpret

295
00:15:49,880 --> 00:16:00,759
pressure as we all have the typical idea

296
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,759
as a capturing tendency for volume

297
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:08,839
okay now we can do the

298
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:12,959
same when instead of exchanging energy

299
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,319
and volume these two systems exchange

300
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,680
energy and

301
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:22,959
particles and let's say

302
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:27,000
particles of one type I see here again

303
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:30,920
another two that slipped fine I to

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,920
remember to correct that

305
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,399
so it's the same story only that instead

306
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:41,120
of energy and volume it's now energy and

307
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,600
amount of constituent

308
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,720
I still the system is isolated the

309
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,120
entropy can only increase and we end up

310
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,680
with these uh

311
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,880
inequalities the first one still

312
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,720
confirms that uh uh the minus one /t is

313
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,600
escaping tendency for

314
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,319
energy regarding chemical potentials

315
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,720
again suppose

316
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:12,439
that you choose the initial temperatures

317
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:17,000
T1 and ta and TB to be

318
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:21,439
equal so the denominators here become

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,600
equal and this is going to be zero so

320
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,079
the only term is is this must be greater

321
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,600
than zero so if I want and also this DV

322
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,400
sorry for the uh the slide is was a cut

323
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,240
and

324
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,240
paste this should be at D

325
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,640
end and also this

326
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,640
one I want to see if you

327
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,960
are uh if you're

328
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,600
attentive well

329
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:58,559
anyway the result is that

330
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:01,400
U if dni must be greater than zero if

331
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:06,400
you want want therefore that system a

332
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:09,760
acquires uh particles of type I through

333
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,120
this semi perable membrane that allows

334
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,880
it to get it from system

335
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:21,960
B you need the chemical

336
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:25,120
potential of uh a to be greater than the

337
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,120
chemical potential of

338
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,760
B is that

339
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,559
correct I'm not so sure anymore because

340
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,520
of all these

341
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,520
mistakes and in fact it

342
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,559
shouldn't it should be uh because

343
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,799
there's a minor sign here and so I

344
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:53,600
either put a minus sign there or I

345
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,600
invert the and the positions of andb

346
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,440
okay

347
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,400
because in order for constituent I to

348
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,559
flow from D to to a I need that the

349
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,799
chemical

350
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:10,200
potential of constituent I in system B

351
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,799
be higher than that in a because

352
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,880
chemical potential at least the title I

353
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:20,280
got wrong right and it's an escaping

354
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,280
tendency for

355
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,600
constituents so this gets a feel of what

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,840
the chemical potentials are if you have

357
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,000
a feel of what the temperature is you

358
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:37,159
also have a feel of what chemical

359
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,120
potentials are temperature works for

360
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:45,640
energy chemical potentials work works

361
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,640
for uh molecules and atoms and so

362
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,760
on and in

363
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,440
fact again if you visit the talk today

364
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,799
by Professor Stone you'll see a lot of

365
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,080
uh chemical potentials

366
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,600
they the chemical gradients they call

367
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,159
them they don't to for short instead of

368
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,159
saying chemical potential gradient or

369
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:13,720
gradient in chemical potential I simply

370
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:14,960
say chemical gradient and since the

371
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,600
chemical

372
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,039
potential goes with the logarithm of the

373
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,520
concentration we'll

374
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,919
see so a gradient in the chemical

375
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,640
potential goes with the gradient of the

376
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,640
log of C

377
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,760
and that's 1 / C gradient of

378
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,799
C

379
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,640
usually people don't talk a lot about

380
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,400
this one / C in

381
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,440
front uh and they simply say well for

382
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,600
example diffusion processes

383
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,159
uh depend on the gradient in

384
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,760
concentrations

385
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,000
true they also also depend on on the

386
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,600
gradi in concentration but there is this

387
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,600
C at the

388
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,279
denominator and when you have a number

389
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:13,400
at denominator and it is small this

390
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:15,120
enhances things so the gradient in

391
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,080
chemical

392
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:24,039
potential uh is has two contributions

393
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,039
one is also this C at the

394
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,640
denominator so for dilute systems the uh

395
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,640
this gets

396
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,960
Amplified and uh it's very nice to see

397
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,799
how many

398
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,760
experiments uh they are able to do in

399
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,760
which this is the driving

400
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:56,200
force but it's also very nice to see

401
00:21:53,279 --> 00:22:03,200
how the modeling

402
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:07,320
part is still a bit uh I would say

403
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,600
primordial uh and uh

404
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,080
uh very few people really care about uh

405
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,039
checking uh if some of the non-

406
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,960
equilibrium phenomena that we will talk

407
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:22,640
in particular on Sager reciprocity cross

408
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,480
coupling effects that we will discuss in

409
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,159
the third part of the course whether

410
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,000
they do play a role or not whether they

411
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,919
are small or not

412
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,880
usually they are neglected but just

413
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,400
neglected because you want a simple

414
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,159
model not because you know that the

415
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,159
effect isn't

416
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,880
there so that's why there is a still a

417
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,559
lot of research and you find lots of uh

418
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,240
very interesting papers on these

419
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:56,720
subjects okay so talking about

420
00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:01,240
experiments uh last time we also talked

421
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,919
about we made a quick uh survey of

422
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,440
the

423
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,400
methods that we have in order to measure

424
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,159
properties of substances or properties

425
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,240
of

426
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:14,720
systems so one is the measuring the

427
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,600
temperature with the thermometer

428
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,600
measuring the pressure with the

429
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,039
monometer measuring the chemical Pro

430
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,360
potentials through a measurement of the

431
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,360
partial pressure of a

432
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,279
constituent when this constituent is in

433
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,760
mutual equilibrium with the system of

434
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,960
Interest through a semi-permeable

435
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,000
membrane permeable only to that

436
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,480
constituent When You Reach chemical

437
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,080
equilibrium that defines the partial

438
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:57,240
pressure of the constituent in the

439
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,240
mixture and that's how you measure that

440
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:09,600
and I skip uh the other slides but just

441
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,720
uh uh remind you that we we we said that

442
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,679
eventually if you are an experimentalist

443
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,559
and you like to characterize properties

444
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,880
of substances or maybe you discover a

445
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,039
new substance and you want to

446
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,080
characterize it what you have to measure

447
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:24,039
in the

448
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,760
lab and what you have to publish and

449
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:30,799
eventually gets listed in a um like the

450
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:36,520
handbook of a chemical

451
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:39,520
physics or the nist uh website where you

452
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,360
can find properties of substances as in

453
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,600
the old times you you would buy the book

454
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,480
The CRC Handbook of chemical physics now

455
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,679
uh books are like uh

456
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,360
in

457
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,600
disappearing uh so you're all virtual

458
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,640
and so you go to the uh websites and

459
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,320
look for these properties or you buy

460
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,320
softwares

461
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:07,399
uh

462
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,960
I you probably use some software uh that

463
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:13,559
has

464
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,480
builtin uh correlations for many

465
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,799
substances and these

466
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,640
correlations give you

467
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:24,159
values for these quantities the specific

468
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,520
I'm sorry the yeah the heat capacities

469
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,399
of your

470
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,159
substance um

471
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:32,200
the

472
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,760
compressibility

473
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,320
Kappa

474
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,039
isothermal or sometimes also another

475
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
kind

476
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,799
of the isentropic

477
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,320
compressibility which is equivalent or

478
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,520
connected to this one and also here it's

479
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,039
either the heat capacity at constant

480
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,440
pressure or the heat capacity at

481
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,720
constant volume because through the

482
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,559
Mayer relation they are

483
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,399
related and the coefficient of expansion

484
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,360
of your

485
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:07,320
substance for

486
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:11,039
example the

487
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,640
compressibility uh if you are in solid

488
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:17,640
mechanics you remember the young modulus

489
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:21,440
of uh some

490
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,720
elasticity well uh this is a sort of

491
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,399
young modulus in the bulk so in

492
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,559
elasticity you do the stretching in one

493
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:33,600
direction if you do it in all three

494
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,600
directions you get uh the

495
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
compressibility

496
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:44,240
coefficient

497
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:49,520
no that's because uh uh that's because V

498
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:52,240
you for a specimen of

499
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:57,240
like parallel

500
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,720
ID uh is given by that and uh if you

501
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,240
have one

502
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,480
over V

503
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:10,559
times the partial of V with respect to

504
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,600
um P at constant T time minus that's

505
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,840
Capa

506
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,840
T that's the isothermal

507
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,880
compressibility so you could you could

508
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,480
write that as

509
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,039
minus the partial of the log of V with

510
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,039
respect to

511
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:33,279
p and because of the additivity of

512
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:36,480
logarithm this is uh you could write it

513
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,519
as the partial of

514
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:44,120
L1 respect to P

515
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,120
so times partial of

516
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,640
L2 is that

517
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:07,240
correct yeah no uh plus not minus

518
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,240
not minus okay minus uh

519
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:16,480
L3 okay so

520
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:21,679
this and that's also sorry uh oh

521
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,960
boy that's more than a senior uh moment

522
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,480
let's do it

523
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,480
again log L1

524
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:36,640
partial PT minus log

525
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,720
L2 and so

526
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,320
on and each one of

527
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,600
these is the young module it's one over

528
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,720
LDL over P so it's the the percentage

529
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:53,880
stretching changing in in

530
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:56,720
distance uh for an increase in uh in in

531
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,399
pressure uh

532
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,519
uh and that's the thing that you measure

533
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:05,640
with the compression compression machine

534
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:09,399
it's the young mod modulus in that

535
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:13,360
direction all right once what we

536
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:16,000
proved is that once you have U

537
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,840
this functions

538
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,480
here you don't just need the one point

539
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,600
you need the entire function so how they

540
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,519
vary in temperature and pressure at

541
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,159
given

542
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:31,840
composition then using these formulas

543
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,120
you can integrate these

544
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,840
formulas and obtain the values for

545
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:40,519
energy and entropy and therefore you can

546
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,159
reconstruct the fundamental relation so

547
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:47,640
that's how you measure the fundamental

548
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:50,760
relation somewhat indirectly through its

549
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,440
derivatives temperature pressure and

550
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,640
derivatives of derivatives like the

551
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,679
specific heat or the heat

552
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,960
capacities Okay so that introduces to

553
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,240
the subject that I started uh I just

554
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,960
barely started last

555
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,960
time which is a

556
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:16,360
again uh a bit boring because it's like

557
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,279
a mathematical game played on the

558
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,919
fundamental

559
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:26,360
relation but it is part of the

560
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,279
traditional um topics that we do in

561
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,200
thermodynamics I certainly think that

562
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:34,080
are needed when you do measurements and

563
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,760
you want to correlate the data you want

564
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,799
to make sure that this relations are are

565
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,799
are

566
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:47,440
satisfied so let's just let's do it I'll

567
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,200
do it as quickly as

568
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,640
possible

569
00:30:49,200 --> 00:31:00,399
um so the idea of Leandra

570
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,399
transform is to describe a a curve this

571
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,519
curve instead as the the the the direct

572
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,880
description f equals F of Y so this is f

573
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,919
and

574
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:17,320
Y in a more indirect

575
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:22,600
description in terms of the

576
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:26,440
family of it the tangent lines to the

577
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:30,760
curve so that the curve becomes the

578
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,760
envelope of this family of

579
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:38,679
lines and this family of lines is

580
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,679
described by uh in such a way that you

581
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:44,600
choose a value

582
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:47,320
for the slope of the line and then you

583
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,919
shift the line until you make you find

584
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,840
the point in which your curve is tangent

585
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,200
to that line with that slope and then

586
00:31:52,840 --> 00:32:00,679
you mark the value of the intercept at y

587
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,919
equal 0 here we call it l of L of Lambda

588
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:06,360
so this L of

589
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,880
Lambda is the legender transform of your

590
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,880
original

591
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,799
function when I have more time but I

592
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:18,120
don't uh

593
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,880
hear I like to play this game this is a

594
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:25,039
game in which you can this is

595
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,240
the the Lan Transformer has applications

596
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,279
also

597
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,480
in mechanics for example it allows you

598
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,120
to

599
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:38,240
design uh in a bridge you know those

600
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,960
bridges with lots of wires you want to

601
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,480
have the wires be distributed in such a

602
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,360
way that they make this envelope and you

603
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:54,279
want to decide which shape of envelope

604
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:54,279
you want okay for example so here's my

605
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,840
bridge and suppose I want my

606
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:07,440
uh the the envelope of these uh things

607
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,440
that sustain the

608
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,039
bridge from a distant distance you want

609
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:19,159
it to have a certain shape maybe a

610
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:23,600
circle or maybe an ellipse or whatever

611
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:27,600
so you fix that shape and then by doing

612
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:31,519
the Leandra transform you find the um uh

613
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:35,960
the the points where you have to U Pull

614
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,960
or or attach your

615
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,399
wires

616
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:48,919
okay so by construction

617
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,840
here essentially L you see if you look

618
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,840
at this triangle you realize that L is

619
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,799
simply

620
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,559
F minus y times the tangent of this Ang

621
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:05,159
angle which is

622
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:09,480
Lambda so L is f minus Lambda

623
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:12,639
y f f minus Lambda

624
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,679
y so that's how you construct

625
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,200
it h you can play these are some

626
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,560
examples for example e to the

627
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,280
Y the Lan transform is Lambda minus

628
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,280
Lambda log

629
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:32,240
Lambda or thean form of of half of Y 2

630
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,560
like

631
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,280
Parabola uh is

632
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,280
exactly uh the same

633
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,040
function and so for quadratic

634
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,560
forms if you put the half the half is

635
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,919
important what is also interesting is if

636
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,639
you like this game I'm not going to to

637
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,720
the details but here is the proof that

638
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,520
uh when you do this kind of

639
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,520
transformation and this is why Leander

640
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,119
does it you don't lose information about

641
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,119
the original

642
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:13,240
function uh and so if you do

643
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,720
again the lender transform of the of the

644
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,280
lender transform you get back your

645
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,280
original

646
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,320
function this is similar to what we've

647
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,280
done

648
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,400
here because we describe

649
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,079
uh

650
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,680
uh this function

651
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:43,320
here

652
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:51,079
in in a smart way which was devised by

653
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Gibbs uh in the late 19 uh 18

654
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:58,000
1800s

655
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,440
um by descri by tangents by you you

656
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,599
describe this function by its partial

657
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,880
derivatives the temperature is is the

658
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,040
slope in One Direction and pressure is

659
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,480
the slope in the other direction so this

660
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:15,119
is why this transformation

661
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,920
matters and uh here in fact is that

662
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,240
transformation

663
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,000
done starting for example on the

664
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,359
fundamental relation based on energy in

665
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,640
energy

666
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,800
form for for which you

667
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,960
remember this is the form of the

668
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:38,040
differential so D is TDS minus

669
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,599
pdv plus chemical

670
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,599
potentials times the

671
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:50,680
end and this line reminds you of what we

672
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,520
just saw so it's the definition of the

673
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,359
generic definition of Lan transform for

674
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,480
for a function f of

675
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:03,160
Y so L IS F Lambda

676
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,920
Y and here is the application so if I

677
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,920
take that

678
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:10,880
function now it is a function of many

679
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,800
variables so I have to choose one at a

680
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,280
time and do a lan transform of one for

681
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,280
example I want to substitute

682
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,760
s with

683
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,200
T so I want to find an equivalent a

684
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,079
function that contains the same

685
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,720
information

686
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,240
of the fundamental

687
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,160
relation but in which the independent I

688
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,760
change the independent variable s to the

689
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,119
uh to its

690
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,000
slope

691
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:46,440
T all

692
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,960
right so it's f f the new function the

693
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,960
Lan transform is the original function

694
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:58,560
minus the product of Lambda time y so

695
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:02,839
Lambda in this case is T and Y is s

696
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,839
this function is called the hel mol free

697
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,920
energy and you can uh uh also write very

698
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,920
easily uh

699
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,839
the

700
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:22,839
uh let's do it um

701
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,200
only forget about the amounts so

702
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,839
okay so we have this one up

703
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,200
there now we have defined the function

704
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:47,240
fals e minus

705
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,240
TS we want to compute

706
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:55,079
DF all right so this is like

707
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,880
D minus D of

708
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:01,440
TS and then we can use the I think it's

709
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:05,240
called lightness Rule that this is equal

710
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,319
to uh so D for de we have it up there

711
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:18,520
it's t d s minus P

712
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:18,520
DV and here this is minus t d s minus s

713
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:28,240
DT so one of these will cancel

714
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:31,560
that and we are left with minus sdt

715
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,359
minus P DV which I hope is what is

716
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,359
written there

717
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,359
yeah

718
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,599
okay okay now so in a sense from the

719
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,040
Practical point of view what have we

720
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,880
done here we gained the fact that we we

721
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,920
we we have a new function that contains

722
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,599
the same information and it is in terms

723
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,160
of properties easily measurable

724
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,160
temperature volume

725
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,880
I could have done it

726
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:09,599
also with respect to the second variable

727
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,720
so change the volume with pressure it's

728
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,839
the conjugate variable so the the temp

729
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:18,520
the the doope in that direction is the

730
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:20,680
conjugate value uh to the volume is the

731
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:25,079
pressure is minus the

732
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:30,480
pressure all right then the L transform

733
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:33,720
is u e the original function minus the

734
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,800
slope which is minus P * V so that's e

735
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,720
plus

736
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,760
PV that's called the

737
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:44,280
enthalpy and you have used it for bulk

738
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:50,040
flow interactions we'll review that

739
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:54,560
extremely quickly uh probably next

740
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:57,000
time no later because it needs uh uh to

741
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,000
it needs the the microscopic the simple

742
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,040
system

743
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,319
model all right so you take

744
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:09,119
uh you take this one it still as the

745
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,480
uh see this is now a fun becomes a

746
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,280
function of spnn you can compute as we

747
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,280
did the

748
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,480
differential and uh it's it still has

749
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,200
entropy so now we can take the Lan trans

750
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,800
form of this

751
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:31,359
one with respect to entropy so

752
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,359
substitute s with its conjugate which is

753
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,920
T not it's not at always entropy that t

754
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:43,200
is the conjugate of s because previously

755
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,800
here you prove by looking at the

756
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,599
differential that t is also the partial

757
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,760
of H with respect to

758
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:55,520
S so by doing that differential we we

759
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:59,119
have found that

760
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,839
t which is from the fundamental relation

761
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,880
up there is the partial of e with

762
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:08,240
respect to S when the other variable is

763
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,720
V I forget the N for the

764
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,400
moment now we also

765
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,040
proved well we didn't prove it but that

766
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:20,079
lines that form of differential says

767
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:23,000
that this is the partial of

768
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,960
H what is it partial of H with respect

769
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,640
to

770
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,200
S when the other variable

771
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,040
is

772
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,520
p

773
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:39,119
okay so I do the Lan transform of this

774
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,440
one so H minus the slope which is T

775
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,160
times the the the original variable

776
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,240
independent variable so that's H minus

777
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:52,800
TS that's e minus TS plus PV that's the

778
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,800
Gibs free energy very

779
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:03,920
important and you

780
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,920
to compute this uh uh

781
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,480
differential yeah because you see by

782
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,880
looking at

783
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,559
U by looking at the form of the

784
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,240
differential like this

785
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,240
one I look at the

786
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,800
coefficients uh it is clear

787
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,559
that this that I circled is the partial

788
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:31,240
derivative of x with respect to T when V

789
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,559
is the other

790
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:38,800
variable so from this one I immediately

791
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,920
can see that minus s is the partial of f

792
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,920
with respect to

793
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,440
T when V is the other

794
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,960
variable and the other it says that

795
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,720
minus p is the partial of f with respect

796
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:58,800
to

797
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,800
V when T is the other variable

798
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:11,359
okay we could also go

799
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:14,280
on usually Nobody Does this

800
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,880
because uh you're not interested in

801
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,599
small

802
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,720
systems but we do it because we

803
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:26,520
are so if I take the Gibs free energy

804
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,760
and transform with respect to one uh of

805
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:33,119
the amount ounts so I want to substitute

806
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,599
now amounts ni I with its conjugate

807
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,760
which is the chemical

808
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,760
potential the

809
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:46,559
slope because the chemical potential is

810
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,880
the partial of G with respect to Mu at

811
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,920
constant

812
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:56,760
10 or

813
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:59,680
when all right so I have G minus uh n *

814
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,599
mu and I

815
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,599
mui

816
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,599
okay

817
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,440
um I was short of letters for this uh

818
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,200
game

819
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,040
so since eventually the last one I want

820
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:20,200
to call Oiler free

821
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,599
energy and this

822
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:26,200
one maybe could be called osmotic free

823
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,960
energy because it plays a role and but

824
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:32,160
because uh

825
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,319
some colleagues uh who are working on

826
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,119
Nano

827
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,760
thermodynamics uh are using introd are

828
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:45,920
introduc beginning to introduce these

829
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,920
names uh so I just call it EU

830
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,920
Sabi and if I do this not just for one

831
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:58,920
but for all so I keep going until I

832
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,920
exhausted all uh the um the constituents

833
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,839
I have this function that I call the

834
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,040
oiler

835
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:11,880
relation Oiler free energy it's G the

836
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:15,880
Gibs free energy minus mu *

837
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,880
n okay

838
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,000
if you remember

839
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
yeah

840
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,040
Sor the f

841
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:13,599
ah yeah this is also probably a cut and

842
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,599
paste problem I guess oh no no

843
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:20,359
no no no this is still okay because if

844
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:22,839
you if you start from um

845
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:25,240
the Elmos free

846
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:28,640
energy and you

847
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,079
transform you get rid of the volume to

848
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,400
get

849
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,160
pressure then you you also get the G

850
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,760
three energy because the G three for the

851
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,359
GB you get G Gib three energy when you

852
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,280
transform with respect to S and V and

853
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:48,319
you can do it you can do it doing first

854
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:50,440
the S and then the V or first the V and

855
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:55,559
then the S and you get the same result

856
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:59,599
sorry I think I was so f is comp energy

857
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,599
f is the letter for the El free

858
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:12,640
energy ah ah the F up there you're right

859
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,480
yeah yeah yeah it's it's difficult to

860
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,680
find

861
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:22,280
letters uh even if you use the Greek

862
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:25,240
alphabet and so on there's still not

863
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,480
enough okay um I wanted to emphasize

864
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:31,440
that this one will will go back to this

865
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:34,160
one and I call it Oiler

866
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,760
because some of you might object well

867
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,760
but this is

868
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:44,319
zero and and the answer is yes this will

869
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:48,079
be zero for the macroscopic

870
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,000
systems but for microscopic systems it

871
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,240
is

872
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,480
not and that's why I I want to uh uh

873
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,400
give it a name and uh and uh let it play

874
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,440
some role until we introduced the idea

875
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,559
of many

876
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,839
particles because um because you this so

877
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:12,000
in a sense you we could write we will

878
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,000
see that in the limit of many

879
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,520
particles which means uh

880
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:27,280
negligible wall raction

881
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,599
effects because the key will be the the

882
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,599
this will tend to

883
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,599
zero

884
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,440
yeah that this one is not

885
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,280
zero and therefore it's something that

886
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,720
you can measure it will depend on the on

887
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:52,960
on how many particles you have um I just

888
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,960
like for

889
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,000
GBS

890
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:15,280
do is in this realm it it starts from

891
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:19,880
the oiler relation the oil requires uh

892
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:22,559
the condition that EU equals

893
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:28,240
zero and so you get all those like the

894
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:30,160
phase rule that comes out of the GS do

895
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:35,000
relation that

896
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,920
applies in this domain of microscopic

897
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,480
systems but

898
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:44,520
here uh let's say that it's

899
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:48,359
still a bit open no there is there is a

900
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:53,440
book which by

901
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:55,200
Terell maybe one are teral

902
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,400
teral

903
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,640
kill thod

904
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:06,359
dynamics of uh small

905
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,200
systems long ago forget now the exact

906
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:13,160
date

907
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,160
uh who did care about uh this

908
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:20,960
thing but I'm not sure that he

909
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:24,559
went uh far enough to talk about phase

910
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:27,520
uh phase transitions in in that

911
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,880
domain so this is still pretty

912
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,520
pretty

913
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,760
open subject but it's becoming important

914
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,559
because of the enormous advances in the

915
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,520
in in

916
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:44,640
in I would say experimental technologies

917
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:49,960
that allow you with microfluidics or uh

918
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:54,920
um Quantum dots and all that stuff to

919
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,920
deal with very small uh systems a few

920
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,520
particles okay

921
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:08,040
well math and math and math all

922
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:11,839
right I told you when we have a function

923
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:14,680
we can play as as as much math as we

924
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,319
want forever and

925
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,480
ever there are so I'm I'm concerned here

926
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:24,119
to tell you only about the useful

927
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:28,280
math and apparently also the second

928
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:33,359
derivatives are useful

929
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:35,960
at least if our project is that of uh

930
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,960
measuring

931
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:41,599
properties because again we don't have

932
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,599
the entropy meter and we don't have the

933
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,680
energy

934
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:48,960
meter so you have to rely on these

935
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,960
tangents to measure

936
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,920
properties so each one of the functions

937
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,559
that we have defined through the Leandra

938
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:00,280
transform

939
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,839
has first uh order derivatives but also

940
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:06,040
second order derivatives for which we

941
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:09,839
have the Schwarz theorem of

942
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:12,720
uh symmetry that says that the order of

943
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,720
derivation doesn't

944
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:20,480
matter so for example if I take the

945
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:22,599
second derivative of the just the

946
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,839
fundamental relation in energy

947
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,960
form with respect to snv

948
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,480
that's

949
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:36,400
equal if I do first s and after V and

950
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:38,400
and vice versa okay so since the partial

951
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,040
of e with respect to V is minus the

952
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,240
pressure this one can also be viewed as

953
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,720
minus the derivative of minus the

954
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,520
pressure with respect to the entropy

955
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:52,319
when the other variables are V and

956
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,079
N the right hand side can be viewed as

957
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,160
the partial of e with respect to S

958
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,960
that's T the temperature

959
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,799
so it's a partial of the temperature we

960
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,680
expect to be at constant I mean at when

961
00:54:01,799 --> 00:54:07,920
when s and n are the other variables so

962
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,920
we get a relation

963
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:16,319
here is the relation is still

964
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:20,079
not fully practical because yes it does

965
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:23,520
have measurable properties almost all

966
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:27,280
all the all places except entropy here

967
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,280
and entropy there

968
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,839
let's do the the same game these are

969
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:36,520
called Maxwell relations by the way

970
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:39,839
uh and there are many anything that

971
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,760
derives from this Force theorem becomes

972
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,920
a Max

973
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,680
relation if you play that with on the

974
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,680
elol free

975
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:54,400
energy here is what we

976
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:57,280
get this is a bit more practical because

977
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,880
you see we have just the entropy here

978
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,040
and the rest is easy easy measurable

979
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,440
stuff pressure volume

980
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,480
temperature so that means that if you

981
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,040
take your

982
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:13,960
substance and want to know how much the

983
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,839
entropy varies with volume at a constant

984
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,760
temperature you could measure it

985
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,960
indirectly using this relation by

986
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,240
measuring how

987
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,599
much by taking the substance increasing

988
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,680
the temperature a little bit seeing how

989
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:30,920
the pressure increases at constant

990
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,039
volume and and once you've measured that

991
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:36,400
you've measured that indirectly so this

992
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:39,160
is one way to it's like an entropy

993
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:42,119
meter it's an indirect measurement of

994
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,880
entropy you could build an entropy meter

995
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,880
based on this

996
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:53,039
relation if you do the same with the

997
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:57,680
enthalpy you get this one not very

998
00:55:53,039 --> 00:56:00,000
useful because it has s on both sides

999
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,599
it's not easy to keep s constant because

1000
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,400
keep s

1001
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,480
constant

1002
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,440
uh yes you could

1003
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,559
do a a weight

1004
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,599
process and uh you could make sure that

1005
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:14,799
it is

1006
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,160
reversible but usually reversible

1007
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,319
processes are not easy to do and often

1008
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,720
you have to

1009
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:25,640
extrapolate to some zero velocities or

1010
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,480
some very high velocities so not easy to

1011
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:32,200
make a to make sure that the to be sure

1012
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,200
in the lab that your process is

1013
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:39,079
reversible the last one if you play the

1014
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:42,160
Maxwell relations game on the G free

1015
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:44,280
energy is also useful it could also be a

1016
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,480
basis for an entropy meter because it

1017
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,000
has entropy only on one

1018
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,240
side so you can see how the entropy

1019
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,240
changes the function of

1020
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:58,440
pressure at constant temperature by

1021
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:01,119
measuring how the volume

1022
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,559
changes if you change the temperature at

1023
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,559
constant

1024
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,760
pressure

1025
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,359
okay you can also have Max will

1026
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,640
relations when you take some derivatives

1027
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:18,960
second order I mean second yeah second

1028
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,960
order

1029
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,680
derivatives with

1030
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,799
respect

1031
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:30,960
to pair of variables of which one is the

1032
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,960
the uh the amount of one

1033
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:38,799
constituent okay so if I do

1034
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:41,200
that temperature and one constituent

1035
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,200
here's the

1036
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,960
relation the derivative of G with

1037
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,880
respect to

1038
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,880
n is the chemical

1039
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:56,680
potential so this is the derivative is

1040
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,119
minus the chemical potential

1041
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,119
uh no

1042
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,799
sorry no it's is the chemical potential

1043
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,559
then I I I I move the minus sign on the

1044
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,559
other

1045
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:11,240
side so the so this one is the

1046
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,720
derivative of mu with respect to

1047
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,799
T whereas the derivative of G with

1048
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,559
respect to T is minus

1049
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:21,640
s and so this is the derivative of s

1050
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:25,640
with respect to

1051
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:28,799
n when the other variables are TP and

1052
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,799
the other amounts of

1053
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:37,000
constituents this is important because

1054
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:39,200
as we do um mixtures uh

1055
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,079
starting

1056
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,559
soon the second part of the course uh we

1057
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,799
will call this the

1058
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:51,039
partial entropy of

1059
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:54,039
constituent uh constituent I in the

1060
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,039
mixture

1061
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:03,400
in the limit of large amounts the

1062
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,799
partial entropy contributes to the

1063
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:08,680
properties of the mixture in proportion

1064
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:11,680
to the amount so you multiply the

1065
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:14,240
amount times the partial entropy sum up

1066
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,880
and you get the entropy for your mixture

1067
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:20,359
that's why it's called partial

1068
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:24,480
entropy this is true only in the limit

1069
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:28,200
of Oiler going to

1070
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:31,039
zero you do this same instead of T you

1071
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,839
do for the pressure and you get this

1072
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:36,000
other derivative of the chemical

1073
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:39,960
potential with respect to

1074
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:44,440
p and this is what we will call the

1075
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:47,000
partial volume of the constituent in the

1076
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,880
mixture again if you take this one

1077
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,400
multiply by the amount sum over all

1078
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,400
constituents that gives you the volume

1079
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,640
with in

1080
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:02,640
general as long as Oiler is equal to

1081
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,440
zero you could also take the the the

1082
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,760
double derivative with respect to two

1083
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,760
different amounts of

1084
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:20,640
constituents and you have this sort of

1085
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,079
reciprocal uh relation says that uh the

1086
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:26,720
derivative

1087
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,920
of potential of constituent one

1088
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,119
with respect to the amounts of

1089
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,520
constituent two is equal to the

1090
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:37,079
derivative of potential of two with

1091
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,079
respect to the amount of constituent

1092
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:46,520
one we will uh use

1093
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,240
this in one of the proofs related to the

1094
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,240
DM

1095
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,240
margules

1096
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,400
relation yeah you could

1097
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,960
also play the same

1098
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:08,680
game starting with

1099
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,760
the

1100
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:14,520
relation

1101
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,920
uh I don't have well starting not with

1102
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:20,359
the fundamental relation in energy form

1103
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:23,000
but in entropy

1104
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:26,039
form and here is the result of the game

1105
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,280
let me skip the details

1106
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:30,640
one of the functions is called the mure

1107
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,640
free

1108
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,440
energy It's s minus E over

1109
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:43,880
T is

1110
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:46,839
entropy or say entropic

1111
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,200
formulation uh becomes more and more

1112
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:52,240
important and so you will

1113
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:56,200
find in the literature

1114
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:57,940
often uh if you go

1115
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,200
um yeah people that

1116
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:02,599
[Music]

1117
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:05,799
do small systems or Quantum

1118
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:07,039
thermodynamics uh s minus U over T you

1119
01:02:05,799 --> 01:02:10,799
find it a

1120
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:15,119
lot some of them recognize that this is

1121
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:17,240
due to M some just call it free

1122
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,799
something or free

1123
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,599
entropy so this

1124
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:26,680
um following them I'll call it massure

1125
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:28,119
free entropy although the

1126
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,520
I I think the term may be a bit

1127
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:35,760
confusing because um um I'm not sure I'm

1128
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,760
not sure what free entropy

1129
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:43,520
means sometimes the words the wrong

1130
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:46,200
words are are confusing and cause uh a

1131
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,119
lot of damage so if I do that I'm sorry

1132
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,880
about

1133
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,880
this but I needed a

1134
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,799
name this is also because instead of um

1135
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:01,799
the G giving it this kind of name for

1136
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:05,279
example in the book with u uh Professor

1137
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:07,480
giftos we were very careful not to use

1138
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:09,799
names that were sort of misleading and

1139
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,559
so we used we call them characteristic

1140
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:14,520
functions characteristic stable

1141
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:20,119
equilibrium State functions it's a more

1142
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:20,119
a septic uh uh way of

1143
01:03:20,279 --> 01:03:27,760
U defining the same thing plank also has

1144
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:31,000
its own

1145
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,000
and uh

1146
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:38,599
again if I do the transform with respect

1147
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,599
to all the variables includ

1148
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:49,160
uh should I includ yeah including also

1149
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:52,599
the yeah including also the all the

1150
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,599
amounts I end

1151
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:58,960
up with the equivalent of the oil

1152
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:05,160
uh relation

1153
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:05,160
here uh I'm call uh how did I call it

1154
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:12,079
Su which is equal to minus EU over

1155
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:15,119
T notice that also the

1156
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:18,799
others are very for example

1157
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:20,480
plank is minus G over T so it's like a

1158
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:22,000
GS free energy divided by the

1159
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,000
temperature

1160
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,720
and M is L M over t so they are

1161
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,319
related and of course you can play also

1162
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,480
the game of uh double derivatives

1163
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:38,680
here

1164
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,920
well by the same token these derivatives

1165
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:43,400
are useful if you want to construct an

1166
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:47,359
energy

1167
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:49,680
meter okay the the first one not so much

1168
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,799
because you have energy on both sides

1169
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:55,079
but this one

1170
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:57,039
yes I can measure as how the energy

1171
01:04:55,079 --> 01:05:00,119
varies with ECT to volume at constant

1172
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:03,079
temperature by measuring pressure

1173
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:06,079
temperature and how the pressure varies

1174
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:09,240
is a function of temperature constant

1175
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:11,319
volume so you could build an energy

1176
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:15,279
meter based on this

1177
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:18,720
equation this one no because it has uh

1178
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:23,079
both sides but the last one

1179
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:26,359
yes although it's not so

1180
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:29,920
simple you have to realize that uh

1181
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:31,960
you have to here change the

1182
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:35,400
temperature of your

1183
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,880
system and see how the volume will

1184
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,760
change while you

1185
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:43,640
keep p/ T constant so if you double the

1186
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,079
temperature you also have to double the

1187
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,359
pressure in order to keep that ratio

1188
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,960
constant and then you measure the energy

1189
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:50,720
how the energy varies with the function

1190
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:56,440
of

1191
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:59,839
P all right so we have ways to measure

1192
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,839
stuff and

1193
01:06:01,279 --> 01:06:08,960
uh and therefore to characterize the

1194
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:11,960
stable equilibrium St states

1195
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,960
of

1196
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,680
substances all right so now we go

1197
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,880
back

1198
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:26,079
to one of the

1199
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:30,920
uh characteristic questions of

1200
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:35,240
that we for which thermodynamics was

1201
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:39,240
born how much useful things or how much

1202
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:44,160
work now that we've defined it can we

1203
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:47,119
do by uh exploiting a

1204
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:52,599
change of some system from one state to

1205
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:56,760
another for example by cooling a hot

1206
01:06:52,599 --> 01:07:00,880
object or also what is the minimum

1207
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:06,079
amount of work that is necessary in

1208
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:08,440
order to obtain a certain change in

1209
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:11,319
state of some my system for example in

1210
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:14,039
material processing uh I

1211
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:16,200
transform uh I got bunch of raw

1212
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:20,799
materials coming in and I want to

1213
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:24,119
produce my uh product like steel no

1214
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:29,039
steel is product you have put you have

1215
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:33,760
to put in uh iron ore and carbon and

1216
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:35,760
lots of other stuff energy so what's the

1217
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:40,680
minimum

1218
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:42,520
requirement to uh produce a unit of your

1219
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,520
product that is

1220
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,520
also

1221
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:54,119
um the typical

1222
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:59,440
question we have already seen the

1223
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:59,440
answer for or uh the case of a

1224
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:06,640
system that varies in uh you want to you

1225
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:09,920
fix now select your system you want to

1226
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:14,480
have a change from A1 to

1227
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:18,040
A2 which could be heating or

1228
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:20,920
cooling if it is cooling it means that

1229
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:23,679
you are extracting energy out of your

1230
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:26,239
system and then maybe you want to know

1231
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,480
how much of that energy can be used in

1232
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:33,600
order to lift a weight so how much is it

1233
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:38,159
useful or it could be

1234
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,839
instead a an increase in energy you want

1235
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:44,040
to heat up your

1236
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:44,040
system and then maybe you want to

1237
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:53,520
know uh how much do I need to lower my

1238
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:56,440
weight so what's the minimum lowering so

1239
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:59,000
what's the minimum work I need to spend

1240
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:02,920
in order to heat up

1241
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,040
something and here we do it with a

1242
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:07,359
reservoir if we have a reservoir

1243
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:11,799
available we can do a lot of stuff that

1244
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:14,600
we cannot do in an adiabatic or a weight

1245
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:16,759
process without the reservoir so the

1246
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:20,040
reservoir plays a

1247
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:20,040
role as we

1248
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:27,000
know so all these questions about

1249
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:29,000
maximum minimum work that can be done or

1250
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,440
useful stuff that can be

1251
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,239
done get solved and this is the basis of

1252
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:39,600
all the homework problems that you have

1253
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:42,920
in our book but also uh any course in

1254
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,560
thermodynamics you solve this Problems

1255
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:48,279
by one defining the

1256
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:51,640
system uh choosing a system for which to

1257
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:57,000
make an energy balance and an entropy

1258
01:09:51,640 --> 01:10:01,080
balance and the choice of your system

1259
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,080
depends on the question of the

1260
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:09,199
problem the energy balance

1261
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:12,120
here is easy and uh so

1262
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:16,199
it's the difference between the final

1263
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:20,159
and initial energy on the left hand side

1264
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:23,800
must be equal to the net energy

1265
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:27,199
input of your system so here since I'm

1266
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:31,239
interested in uh uh the the

1267
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:35,880
work done in order to lift the weight or

1268
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:38,360
maybe the work re received if the weight

1269
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:41,920
goes instead

1270
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:46,120
down um the system I I'm doing the

1271
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:49,880
energy for is the composite system a

1272
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:51,440
andr so the entropy

1273
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,280
balance

1274
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:58,320
says the final entropy which is the sum

1275
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:01,520
of the uh entropies of the two systems

1276
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,520
minus the initial

1277
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,719
entropy must be equal to the entropy

1278
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:09,159
exchanged plus the entropy generated

1279
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,880
within the system but since this is a

1280
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:13,840
work interaction only there is no

1281
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:17,960
entropy exchange so there is zero here

1282
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,960
and then there is uh entropy

1283
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:25,719
generation and then I also have to

1284
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:28,239
remember that at least for the reservoir

1285
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:32,199
I know uh

1286
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:33,960
it's I know an easy I mean the the the

1287
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:35,520
fundamental relation is easy enough that

1288
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,840
I can write it it's the equation of a

1289
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,920
straight line so a linear relation

1290
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,800
between change in energy and change in

1291
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,800
entropy the slope being the temperature

1292
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,800
of the

1293
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,800
reservoir

1294
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:54,040
okay all

1295
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:56,560
right so now you solve that so we have

1296
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:58,800
three equations you can use them to

1297
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,000
eliminate two variables so let's

1298
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,960
eliminate the change in energy for the

1299
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,960
reservoir and the change in entropy for

1300
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,960
the um for the

1301
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:15,239
res you combine and this is what you

1302
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,239
obtain you you're left with one

1303
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:23,440
equation E1 initial energy of a minus

1304
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,880
final energy of a minus the temperature

1305
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:31,000
of the res times initial entropy of a

1306
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:35,600
minus entropy of final entropy of a

1307
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:40,960
minus s generated multiplied by

1308
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:47,320
TR so you could write this as uh W

1309
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:47,320
rev minus TRS generated

1310
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:55,600
because when s generator is equal to

1311
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:58,400
zero the work is is corresponds to the

1312
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,400
reversible

1313
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:06,600
process you could also write this in

1314
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:08,080
terms of what we already defined as

1315
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:12,960
available

1316
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:15,440
energy so the work done in the

1317
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,719
reversible case so

1318
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:21,120
this uh first part of the right hand

1319
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:23,840
side is equal to the

1320
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,199
difference of the available energy of

1321
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,480
system a in the initial

1322
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:31,560
State and that in the final

1323
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:33,239
State and this is the formula for the

1324
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,600
available energy that we have seen when

1325
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:39,639
we just after the definition of entropy

1326
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,199
if you go back you can find that okay

1327
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:43,840
there is still another interesting way

1328
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,840
of writing

1329
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:50,400
this by defining

1330
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:51,920
a um we can call it an availability

1331
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:56,040
function another

1332
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:57,440
function uh um I'll call it canonical

1333
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,960
availability

1334
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:04,120
function just because

1335
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:07,600
later uh we need to Define other similar

1336
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:09,719
things and we need the names but soon we

1337
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:12,800
will get short of of letters and names

1338
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:17,960
also in this business here in any case

1339
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,960
we call gamma e minus

1340
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,440
TRS and notice therefore that the

1341
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,440
available

1342
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:29,920
energy is equal to gamma minus gamma

1343
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,199
R gamma

1344
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:35,679
R is the

1345
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:38,440
evaluation of this function at the state

1346
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:41,760
a r where the system a is in neutral

1347
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,760
stable equilibrium with the

1348
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:47,600
res

1349
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,719
okay so the available energy is the

1350
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,560
difference

1351
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:56,560
between the availability function at the

1352
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:59,280
generic state of your system and and the

1353
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:03,000
value of that availability function at

1354
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,000
the mutual equili state with the

1355
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:09,760
reservoir notice

1356
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:16,120
that when I am at in equilibrium with

1357
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:18,480
the reservoir the temperature of um by

1358
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:20,560
by the conditions for Mutual equilibrium

1359
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,920
the temperature of my system a is equal

1360
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:27,360
to the temperature of the

1361
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:30,800
reservoir and so this t R in that state

1362
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:35,520
is also the temperature of your

1363
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:38,280
system so in that stable M Mutual stable

1364
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:42,040
equilibrium State gamma

1365
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:44,280
R takes up the value of one of those

1366
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:48,440
Leander transform that we called the

1367
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:52,120
helal free energy we called it

1368
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:56,239
f e minus

1369
01:15:52,120 --> 01:16:01,800
TS but this function is not e us Ts for

1370
01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:01,800
other states it's e minus TR r s so it's

1371
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:11,239
different we can do the representation

1372
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,239
on the E sucess

1373
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:22,800
diagram so

1374
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:28,400
gamma is e minus TR

1375
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:31,719
RS okay so let's see uh

1376
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:36,880
e is this

1377
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:39,880
much from here to here

1378
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,880
to

1379
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:49,120
yeah no sorry let's say that we set this

1380
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,400
equal e is equal to zero is here the

1381
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:55,040
origin so E1 is this

1382
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:59,560
length Okay and then I need to to

1383
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:02,760
subtract TR * S1 so TR is the slope of

1384
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:07,000
this line so I take it as a line with a

1385
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:13,639
slope equal to tr starting from the

1386
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:18,239
origin so TR * S1 is this segment

1387
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:22,080
dashed so gamma is represented by

1388
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:25,560
this distance between this and that

1389
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:28,040
because it's this L length minus this

1390
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:32,400
length

1391
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:34,159
Okay this is for the generic State a A1

1392
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,000
for the state in which the system is in

1393
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:37,880
mutual equilibrium with the reservoir

1394
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,760
its temperature

1395
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:43,880
TR we are

1396
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:47,360
here and that same construction so the

1397
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:50,560
distance from the line with lope TR

1398
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:53,560
originating at the origin

1399
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:57,600
uh is this

1400
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,600
much so so this is gamma

1401
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:06,400
R and now you may you may see that this

1402
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:09,239
gamma

1403
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:13,280
R is the minimum value that that

1404
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:15,600
characteristic function can

1405
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,000
take I'm sorry that availability

1406
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:22,239
function can

1407
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,280
take any other state whether it is

1408
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,360
stable equilibrium so if you go along

1409
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:29,400
this curve

1410
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:31,600
either side of AR or if you go inside

1411
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,440
the region of non

1412
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,159
equilibrium of course here we are

1413
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:39,440
talking about fixed values of N and

1414
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:43,280
V the function the the the values of

1415
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,960
gamma are greater than gamma R so gamma

1416
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,960
R is

1417
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:56,159
minimum so that means that if I start

1418
01:18:52,120 --> 01:19:00,320
from here and go any where

1419
01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:02,159
else I must decrease gamma I'm sorry I

1420
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,719
must increase

1421
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:10,000
gamma all

1422
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:12,520
right so I start from State a r go to

1423
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,520
any other

1424
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:19,800
state then the Delta so the change in

1425
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,800
gamma is

1426
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,280
positive that condition

1427
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,639
gives

1428
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,639
uh rules

1429
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:38,120
about

1430
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:41,080
um it it's the

1431
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:43,840
generating uh

1432
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:45,520
inequality for inequalities regarding

1433
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,280
the second order derivatives and

1434
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,360
therefore they have to go do with

1435
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:55,639
stability and the uh the concavity or

1436
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,639
convexity of Curves

1437
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:01,800
in particular this is in a sense a

1438
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,400
review because we already encountered

1439
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,280
these particular

1440
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:10,520
ones but this is just to give the idea

1441
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:13,320
so I'm I I apply this principle that is

1442
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:18,840
I move away from this state no matter

1443
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:18,840
where I go I Al I always increase

1444
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:25,760
gamma

1445
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:29,199
uh so let me apply it to one particular

1446
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:33,679
change so I decide to go

1447
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:40,639
to just a small change so with a small

1448
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:43,360
amount of u entropy change DS D for

1449
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:46,239
infinitesimal and also I choose to

1450
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:49,719
move along the stable equilibrium State

1451
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:51,320
curve so I'm going this side but the S

1452
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:53,159
could also be negative so I can go the

1453
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:56,639
other side but along the stable

1454
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:56,639
equilibrium State curve

1455
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:01,880
okay so if I change the entropy and I

1456
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:05,239
move along the uh stable equilibrium

1457
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:08,159
State curve the energy changes according

1458
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:08,159
to the fundamental

1459
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:15,360
relation so I

1460
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,360
move from

1461
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,120
ER to another energy which is given by

1462
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,960
the foundamental relation it's given by

1463
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,840
this

1464
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:29,719
one and I can use a tailor series

1465
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:29,719
expansion around uh the original

1466
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,080
point and

1467
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:48,199
uh there yeah okay so the taor series

1468
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:51,760
expansion has a value which is equal to

1469
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:53,639
a which cancels with that and I have

1470
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,400
first order term which is the derivative

1471
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:59,719
of e with respect to s which is the

1472
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:03,880
temperature which at the

1473
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:07,560
uh point where I stting uh is the

1474
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:12,199
temperature TR time the S Plus the

1475
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:15,400
second order terms in the tailor

1476
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:17,920
expansion and remember that here V and N

1477
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:23,679
are fixed so this we could call it the

1478
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:23,679
second differential of a at fixed n andv

1479
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:32,400
okay so that's Delta

1480
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:36,080
e now I substitute into Delta

1481
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:39,600
gamma to compute so Delta gamma is going

1482
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:43,239
to be uh since gamma is e minus TRS

1483
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:45,400
Delta gamma is Delta e minus TR Delta s

1484
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:49,800
so I

1485
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:52,800
substitute and this TR Delta

1486
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:56,440
s cancels with that one so I'm left with

1487
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,440
the second order differential only

1488
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:02,800
and since these plus the dots dots dots

1489
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,760
must be strictly greater than

1490
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,840
zero it

1491
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:12,560
requires that this term must be greater

1492
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:16,600
than or equal to zero so that gives

1493
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,600
us one

1494
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:24,600
condition I could also have chosen to

1495
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,600
move to a state

1496
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:30,480
in which instead I change I decide how

1497
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:32,480
much uh I change energy I still move

1498
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:36,600
along a stable equilibrium State curve

1499
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,600
but now I decide the value of the

1500
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:43,800
E well then the Taylor series expansion

1501
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:45,440
gives me this and the Delta gamma

1502
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:48,280
becomes

1503
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:51,920
minus the

1504
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:56,120
second lots of things cancel as before

1505
01:23:51,920 --> 01:24:00,800
and so I'm left with Delta gamma is

1506
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:05,080
minus uh the second differential of

1507
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,880
s and for this to be greater than zero

1508
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:10,480
it

1509
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:13,040
requires that to be uh whoops this is

1510
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:15,639
wrong this should be I have to correct

1511
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:18,080
that too this should be less than or

1512
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:18,080
equal to

1513
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:24,560
zero okay I'll correct it in the slides

1514
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:34,080
okay so remember when we talked about

1515
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:38,679
concavity we had quickly passed this U

1516
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:44,800
uh slide where we took the fundamental

1517
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:47,920
relation and took in full Glory the uh

1518
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,719
Matrix of second order

1519
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:56,320
derivatives uh which is the asan of

1520
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:56,320
Matrix of the relation

1521
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,840
if some of

1522
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:07,040
these if you for if you keep fixed some

1523
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:10,400
of these variables it becomes a function

1524
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:14,520
of fewer variables so the the as becomes

1525
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:19,119
smaller and if I keep if I keep n and v

1526
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:22,880
as we did in the previous thing uh uh

1527
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:26,880
fixed this becomes just the as becomes

1528
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,880
just the second order

1529
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:32,960
derivative all right so let's we may

1530
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,960
call it the partial

1531
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:40,600
s and

1532
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,600
uh what we

1533
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:50,040
proved is that d s

1534
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:54,119
d2s should be and here it is correct

1535
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:54,119
less than or equal to zero

1536
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:05,840
okay so d2s is equal to uh the second

1537
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:05,840
derivative

1538
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,119
times D

1539
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:21,320
Squared because here the 2s in general

1540
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:24,400
is the asan Matrix that you gets

1541
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:26,880
Multiplied on left and also on the right

1542
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:29,840
by the de so you get the de squared and

1543
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,360
all the combinations this is in general

1544
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,639
in the particular case this is just de

1545
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:37,520
squared and since it is squared that

1546
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:39,920
simply

1547
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:43,239
requires that this

1548
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,320
derivative uh be negative and therefore

1549
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:48,320
we get the

1550
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,320
uh

1551
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:54,920
concavity of the S versus e relation

1552
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:57,400
which justifies

1553
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:01,159
uh our drawing the eers

1554
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:01,159
Suess diagram that

1555
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:11,520
way but for

1556
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:14,800
example recalling that the partial of s

1557
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:17,960
with respect to e is one over the

1558
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:21,520
temperature this

1559
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:23,800
derivative can be written this

1560
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,920
way because it's derivative with respect

1561
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,360
to e

1562
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:31,600
of one/ the temperature so it's minus 1

1563
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:34,639
/ t t s * derivative of t with respect

1564
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:37,679
to e and if you go back to what we

1565
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:41,600
defined we called heat capacity at

1566
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:44,840
constant volume this is just the

1567
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,840
inverse of

1568
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:52,239
CD so this second derivative is equal to

1569
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:56,239
-1 / T ^2 over

1570
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:59,280
CV and that requires therefore that CV

1571
01:27:56,239 --> 01:28:02,840
since it has to be negative it requires

1572
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,840
that CV is greater than equal to

1573
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:11,560
zero so for your models if you have a

1574
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:16,000
substance with a negative CV you are in

1575
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:16,000
trouble you have no substance you made a

1576
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,880
mistake

1577
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:28,560
um also from the other um equation that

1578
01:28:25,159 --> 01:28:31,400
we have oops condition that we have here

1579
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:34,040
d2e greater than equal to zero we

1580
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:36,800
can uh remember that the partial of e

1581
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:39,239
with respect to S is the temperature see

1582
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,880
this is also written is also equal to

1583
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:43,920
the partial of t with respect to

1584
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:47,600
S

1585
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:50,239
okay which is greater than

1586
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:55,000
zero and this

1587
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:58,159
also uh is related to to the one above

1588
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,159
gives the same practical

1589
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,639
result these

1590
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:19,719
inequalities

1591
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:23,239
um give a an interesting uh give rise or

1592
01:29:19,719 --> 01:29:25,639
are manifestations of a a general

1593
01:29:23,239 --> 01:29:29,880
principle that it's chatelier or

1594
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:29,880
chatelier brown theorem or

1595
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:40,320
principle that uh if we combine it with

1596
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:44,719
the idea that we have seen today uh that

1597
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,719
temperature is an escaping tendency for

1598
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:51,880
energy you see what this

1599
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:55,800
says if uh at fixed N andv I give some

1600
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:55,800
energy to my system

1601
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,480
it increases its

1602
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:04,800
temperature well we all know that did we

1603
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:08,199
need so many lectures to get to this

1604
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:10,360
result all right this also says that if

1605
01:30:08,199 --> 01:30:13,639
you give some

1606
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:16,199
entropy the temperature will

1607
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:18,800
increase but the

1608
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:20,560
temperature is the escaping tendency for

1609
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:24,320
energy so that means that if I give

1610
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,320
energy to my system

1611
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:28,159
in a sense it

1612
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:32,719
reacts by

1613
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:37,040
hiring its willingness to give away

1614
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:39,360
energy so it it is as if it counteracts

1615
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:42,920
it wants to counteract what you're doing

1616
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:46,520
so if you externally uh heat up the

1617
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:48,159
system uh you give energy and then it

1618
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:51,920
reacts

1619
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:55,480
by uh shaping things so it as as soon as

1620
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:57,600
it can it gives that energy away

1621
01:30:55,480 --> 01:31:00,960
so for example if you start with your

1622
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:04,840
system in mutual equilibrium with your

1623
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:07,400
thermal Reservoir and externally give

1624
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:11,320
some energy to your system it will get

1625
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:13,719
off equilibrium off Mutual

1626
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:16,800
equilibrium higher temperature than the

1627
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:19,000
reservoir that higher temperature will

1628
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,560
so that will make will make up a

1629
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,920
difference in temperature that will

1630
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:25,920
drive an energy exchange back to the res

1631
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:33,320
thereby your system will try to

1632
01:31:30,679 --> 01:31:36,960
reestablish

1633
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:38,600
equilibrium so you can see this natural

1634
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:43,560
tendency

1635
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:45,440
of uh reestablishing equilibrium here as

1636
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:49,400
a

1637
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:53,639
uh as a theorem

1638
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:54,400
that also emerges from the uh stability

1639
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:59,119
condition

1640
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:59,119
and the concavity of the fundamental

1641
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:06,360
relation chatelier Brown theorem of

1642
01:32:03,639 --> 01:32:10,080
course is more General and we'll we'll

1643
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:13,320
see a little more the next time about

1644
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:15,520
this it's not just when you do this with

1645
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:17,199
respect to these variables but also when

1646
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:21,560
you do it with respect to many other

1647
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:26,639
variables and also it has an additional

1648
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:30,119
little um other twist that uh um we we

1649
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:35,400
will see when we do two

1650
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:38,000
variables okay but for today I think

1651
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:42,280
that yeah we are

1652
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:46,400
done and we are just in time okay so

1653
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:46,400
I'll see you next time
