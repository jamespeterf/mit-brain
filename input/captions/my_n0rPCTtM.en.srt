1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,160
yeah great uh we're going to get started

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,200
in just a second um thanks for coming so

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,880
uh I just want to introduce roit uh

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,879
who's going to give a talk on pricing

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
for preservation uh designing network

6
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:21,600
based incentives for sustainable

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,640
for thanks thanks Aaron uh so this is

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,480
basically joint work with my Pi

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,960
Professor sa hamim here in litz uh so

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,800
let me begin with some motivation so the

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,879
conversion of tropical forests into

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,000
agricultural plantations especially when

13
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,680
done unsustainably is responsible for

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,079
massive greenhouse gas emissions right

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,239
uh especially over the recent years this

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,800
has happened but this is the

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,879
Environmental side of the story and

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,800
there is also an economic angle to it it

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,440
has been found that uh by reducing the

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,559
prices of forest Commodities it is

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,760
possible to reduce the forest loss as

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,840
measured in the number of hectares of

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,240
forest lost to uh cons to agricultural

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,600
plantations it is able we are able to

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
reduce this Forest loss by reducing the

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,080
prices of forest Commodities so that is

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,880
good news but if you go on reducing the

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,640
prices of agricultural Commodities then

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,360
that is bound to hurt the livelihoods of

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,520
the producers of these Commodities right

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,560
so that takes us to the key challenge as

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,240
identified by the center for

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,920
international Forest research which is

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,000
to uh reduce the total output of carbon

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
emissions and greenhouse gas emissions

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,240
in a manner that does not compromise on

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
the economic well-being or stability of

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,399
the deforesting entities which are the

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,880
producers of these Forest Commodities

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,920
basically so basically it seeks to

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,399
balance an environmental objective with

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,039
an economic objective and there are many

43
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,039
policies that have already attempted to

44
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,920
address this challenge in many ways but

45
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,520
they all have a common shortcoming which

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,520
is that they do not account for

47
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,959
interactions between the producers of

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
these Forest Commodities or what we call

49
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,720
synergistic interactions which are

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,200
basically interactions that take take

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,720
the form of uh knowledge sharing sharing

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,160
common Transportation routs uh exchange

53
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,120
of farming equipment and so on and they

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,400
are aimed at enhancing the agricultural

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,200
yield of the of the uh plantation owners

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,560
and the cultivators but in the process

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,000
they also end up increasing the

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,480
prevalence of deforestation right when

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,560
the cultivators get together and uh make

60
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,360
their agricultural activities more

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,120
effective then it versin deforestation

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,519
so uh the effects of these interactions

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,959
on the deforestation rates are not taken

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
into account by existing policies which

65
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,959
is something that we tried to address

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,920
through this work

67
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,319
so basically we need policies that

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,680
balance environmental and economic goals

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,560
while explicitly accounting for these

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,120
interactions between

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,400
cultivators so uh we model the problem

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,760
as follows we have a network of n agents

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Each of which is a cultivator right uh

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,000
and the network is represented by a

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,799
Sorry by a by an undirected graph which

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,920
is uh a graph with an adjacency Matrix G

77
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,480
which is non- negative and uh what this

78
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,640
graph means is that if two or more

79
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,799
agents are adjacent to each other in the

80
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
in the network then it means that those

81
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,760
two agents do collaborate with each

82
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,640
other to enhance their agricultural

83
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,120
yield and the the structure of this

84
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,000
strategic interaction Network depends on

85
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,599
both the geography of the plantations uh

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,920
of the Agricultural plantations that

87
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,200
they manage as well as the ownership

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,879
structure of these plantations

89
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,400
then uh the agents engage in a

90
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,439
combination of two possible activities

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,159
activity a is called sustainable

92
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,480
agriculture which is basically the set

93
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,959
of all the forest commodity production

94
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,000
activities that uh do not encroach on

95
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
protected forests and they also do not

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,400
involve unsustainable practices like

97
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,000
clearing pet swamps and U activities

98
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,960
that send out a lot of carbon into the

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,960
atmosphere those are not done in

100
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,880
activity a where whereas activity B is

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,919
what we call unsustainable Agriculture

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,840
and it refers to the collection of all

103
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,039
tasks agricultural tasks that encroach

104
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,160
upon protected forest or result in a lot

105
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:46,479
of carbon emissions basically then uh

106
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,880
the agent's goal is to perform the

107
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,440
activities in such a way that it

108
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,520
maximizes their profits their individual

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,840
profits okay and I'm going to talk more

110
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,240
about the payoffs in uh more detail in

111
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,240
the coming slides I'll describe the

112
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,720
utility structure in detail and our

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,080
contribution here is that we design

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,639
price shaping policies or policies that

115
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,919
alter the prices of sustainable Goods

116
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,759
which are a result of activity a and

117
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,199
unsustainable Goods which are a result

118
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:20,199
of activity B so that uh we can shape

119
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,880
the incentives of the agents to maximize

120
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,360
what we call welfare which is the sum

121
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,160
total of all the agents payoffs uh which

122
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,440
is a total measure of well-being in the

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,000
network while limiting the total

124
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,800
unsustainable effort right while making

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,720
sure that the aggregate unsustainable

126
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
effort is below a certain upper bound

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,720
which I will explain and these policies

128
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,440
take the form of premiums and penalties

129
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,840
premiums are basically monetary rewards

130
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,280
for sustainable production and you can

131
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,039
think of Premium as a quantity that gets

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,560
added to the prices of sustainable

133
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,280
products and penalties are the opposite

134
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,319
they are uh quantities or their amounts

135
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,280
of money that uh get effectively they

136
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,360
get subtracted from the prices of

137
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,120
unsustainable products right so

138
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,479
penalties for unsustainable production

139
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,280
and premiums for sustainable production

140
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,840
and an example comes from European

141
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,400
Union's deforestation regulation which

142
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,120
basically uses these pre premiums and

143
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,599
penalties to effectively uh make sure

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,000
that no uh no unsustainable product get

145
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,880
gets traded from tropical countries into

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,039
the European

147
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,800
Union uh and before I make the problem

148
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,080
more precise I should mention that this

149
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,280
work of ours is related to three bodies

150
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,319
of literature one of which focuses uh

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,280
primarily on uh modeling interactions

152
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,880
between cultivators in the in the

153
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,960
context of forest management which is

154
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,319
the top set of works there's not a lot

155
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,360
of those then there is a set of works

156
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,280
that focuses heavily on sustainable

157
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,840
Forest management but does not really uh

158
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,840
focus on the interaction between the

159
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,840
cultivators right so it does not use any

160
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,039
tools from Game Theory and there is then

161
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,879
a body of work works that focuses on U

162
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,960
the problem of intervention design or

163
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,080
policy design in a broad sense in

164
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,759
Network games so it's more of game

165
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,400
theory and network analysis literature

166
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,120
uh but does not really necessarily

167
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,599
concern Forest management so our work is

168
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,560
the first to lie at this intersection

169
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,319
because we we uh propose a network game

170
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,319
model uh using which we develop some uh

171
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,360
policies uh meaning premiums and

172
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,080
penalties or their combinations for

173
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,879
sustainable Forest management so in some

174
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,440
sense our work combines all the three

175
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,199
and it also shows how tools from Game

176
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,919
Theory and optimization and also network

177
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,000
analysis can be used to evolve such uh

178
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,520
policies in an effective

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,240
manner uh so now let me give you some

180
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,360
more details about the utility structure

181
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,159
and the coupling between the two

182
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,840
activities a which is sustainable

183
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,080
agriculture and activity B which is the

184
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,479
bad activity which is unsustainable

185
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,199
agriculture basically uh but yeah please

186
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,759
feel free to stop me if you have any

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,240
questions at any point

188
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,879
uh so when you think of rewards the

189
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,400
first thing that comes to your mind is

190
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
the profits obtained on selling uh the

191
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,479
the products right whether they are

192
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,479
sustainable or unsustainable it doesn't

193
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,639
matter the first component of the

194
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:25,240
utility is the uh monetary payoff And We

195
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,879
additionally also incorporate U the the

196
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,759
aspect of diminishing returns which

197
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,719
means uh if the if the cultivators overe

198
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,320
exploit their labor and resources then

199
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,800
it is bound to cause uh uh cause a

200
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,599
reduction in the rate at which the

201
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,919
reward increases in the effort which we

202
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,200
call diminishing returns so these two U

203
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,519
aspects are incorporated into two terms

204
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,040
very specifically in this utility

205
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,560
function uh which is describing the

206
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,000
utility of agent I or cultivator I

207
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,120
through activity a which is sustainable

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,800
agriculture right so this is the payoff

209
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,839
of a agent I if the agent uh only

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,800
produces sustainable goods and not

211
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,720
unsustainable Goods similarly uh if the

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,519
agent were to produce only unsustainable

213
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,600
Goods then their payoff would be uib

214
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,760
right it has the same structure as UIA

215
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
then you might imagine that an agent

216
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,000
that produces both sustainable and

217
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,920
unsustainable goods for whatever reason

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,040
gets a total payoff that is just the sum

219
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,120
of their individual payoffs where uh

220
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,680
yeah sorry uh I think I I should mention

221
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,000
here that P stands for prices and X

222
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,079
stands for the volume of the produce

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,720
right so Pia stands for the uh per unit

224
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:47,880
price of uh the quantity of sustainable

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,640
goods and uh xia is the volume or the

226
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,120
number of units of sustainable Goods

227
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,839
similarly pib is the price per unit of

228
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,519
unsustainable goods and xib is the

229
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,040
number of units of unsustainable Goods

230
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,720
produced yeah so when you add

231
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,560
sorry when you per when when you

232
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
consider an agent that performs both

233
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,600
activities A and B then you might

234
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,279
imagine their total utility to be just

235
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,240
the sum of the individual utilities but

236
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,760
that is not true because there is a

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,480
coupling between the two activities okay

238
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,160
so this particular term is what we call

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,200
substitutability it basically uh

240
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,720
quantifies the extent to which one

241
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,760
activity substitutes for the other and

242
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,760
this happens when the agent uh divides

243
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,079
their effort e and labor between the two

244
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,480
activities invariably causing some of

245
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,880
the effort to be transferred from one

246
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,680
activity to another right because if the

247
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,639
agent is really trying hard to perform

248
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,240
both the activities it's not possible

249
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,720
because the agent has bounded a limited

250
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,120
amount of Labor and resources so some of

251
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,880
the uh labor is bound uh to be

252
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,600
transferred from one activity to another

253
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,720
and that the loss in uh the the loss of

254
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,920
utility from this division of effort and

255
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,120
labor is what we call substitutability

256
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,120
and this by the way is not a game

257
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,560
because so far this agent has not

258
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,079
started interacting with others so now

259
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,800
let us incorporate the effects of

260
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,360
interactions of the agents over a

261
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,200
network okay so the first two uh terms

262
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,160
are basically uh terms that capture the

263
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,800
effects of within activity or intra

264
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,680
activity interactions so interactions

265
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,560
between the agents that are both

266
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,600
involved either in activity a or agents

267
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,639
that are both involved in activity B but

268
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,880
not uh this does not account for

269
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,839
interactions across the two activities

270
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,480
so how do we do that we uh incorporate

271
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,839
two additional terms that take into

272
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,680
account the uh utilities resulting from

273
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,600
the utility gains resulting from the

274
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,519
interactions of the agents across the

275
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,399
two activities so you can think of this

276
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,760
as uh some

277
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,200
cultivator uh using their Plantation to

278
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,760
mainly produce sustainable goods and a

279
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,959
neighboring cultivator mainly producing

280
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,320
unsustainable goods and the two agents

281
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,079
if they interact with each other by

282
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,200
sharing farming equipment or using

283
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,480
common Transportation routes then their

284
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,560
payoffs will increase by these amounts

285
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,079
okay I'm not going into too much details

286
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,160
since we don't have much time so the

287
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,160
effect of the intra activity

288
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,079
interactions on the utility is what we

289
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,240
call interactivity Network effect and

290
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,639
it's basically Quantified by this

291
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,079
parameter Delta you know this is like

292
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,120
the essence of both the terms of there

293
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,000
and the effect of the Cross activity

294
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,680
interactions on the utility which is the

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,959
utility gain on interacting with people

296
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,600
who are not like you who are in the

297
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
opposite activity that's called the

298
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,160
cross activity Network effect now uh the

299
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,360
question is how do we exploit this

300
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,040
complex utility structure to design

301
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,399
policies that uh reduce the incentive

302
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,800
for unsustainable production because our

303
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,079
ultimate goal is to improve the

304
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,440
well-being without uh while you know

305
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,279
without letting the total amount of

306
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,079
unsustainable production in the network

307
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,880
exceed a certain upper bound which we

308
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:08,279
are going to Define so how do we make

309
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,600
sure to disincentivize activity P one

310
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:13,199
way to do that would be to Simply raise

311
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,440
the prices of sustainable Goods right

312
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,880
but that is not guaranteed to work

313
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,360
because there is a transfer of incentive

314
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,399
that takes place from the good activity

315
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,199
to the bad activity right from activity

316
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,600
a to activity B through the cross

317
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,079
activity Network effect so it's possible

318
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,480
that increasing the prices of

319
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,399
sustainable Goods is also going to uh

320
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,959
increase the total incentive for

321
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,800
unsustainable production which is not

322
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,480
something we want right uh in particular

323
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,760
it can be found that on raising the

324
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,040
prices of sustainable Goods so Pi

325
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,000
basically stands for prices of

326
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,120
sustainable Goods the interactivity and

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,160
cross activity interactions will have an

328
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,959
opposing effect on the unsustainable

329
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,000
effort levels and uh whether the

330
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,920
unsustainable effort levels go down or

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
go or the increase right whether they

332
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,800
decrease or increase totally will depend

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
on which of these two opposing effects

334
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,880
uh dominates the other and the answer to

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,440
that question comes from our first main

336
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,279
result so this result says that uh if

337
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,360
the cross activity effect parameter is

338
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,959
weaker than is less than the product of

339
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,560
the substitutability and the intra

340
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
activity effect parameter which

341
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,000
effectively means that uh the cross

342
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,440
activity interactions are dominated by

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,759
the interactivity interaction which

344
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,680
means they're quite weak in that case we

345
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,440
uh we can say that our intuition Works

346
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,839
which means that the total amount of

347
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,880
unsustainable effort or production in

348
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,240
the network will decrease with the

349
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,920
sustainable good prices regardless of

350
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,440
the structure of the network so no

351
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,480
matter how the network looks in this

352
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,560
case we can uh blindly increase the

353
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
prices of sustainable Goods if we want

354
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,639
to Simply decrease the total level of

355
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,639
unsustainable activity in the network

356
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,600
workor however if the cross activity

357
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,040
effect parameter is violating this

358
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,759
inequality and uh in particular if it is

359
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,199
uh very strong uh as Quantified by this

360
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,880
inequality which essentially means that

361
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,399
the cross activity interactions are

362
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,880
dominating the interactivity

363
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,360
interactions as shown in this figure

364
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,399
then in this case the total amount of

365
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,000
unsustainable effort or production will

366
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,759
actually increase rather than decrease

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,360
with the prices of sustainable Goods

368
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,120
meaning if you uh give sustain if you

369
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,600
offer sustainability

370
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
premiums uh to raise the prices of

371
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,759
sustainable Goods then that will not

372
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,720
only increase the incentive for

373
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,759
sustainable production but it will also

374
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,120
increase the incentive for unsustainable

375
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,279
production and our premiums will

376
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,120
backfire they will make the situation

377
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,680
worse from an environmental Viewpoint

378
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,800
and this will happen regardless of the

379
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,519
structure of the network no matter how

380
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,279
what the network looks like or no matter

381
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
what the adjacency Matrix looks like

382
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,079
this will happen then there is an

383
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,800
intermediate case when the cross

384
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,680
activity effect is uh neither here nor

385
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,800
there and we cannot really compare it

386
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,800
very well with the interactivity effect

387
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,399
and in this case we cannot say much but

388
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,480
we can still say that there will exist

389
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,079
one particular topology or connectivity

390
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,839
pattern of the Strategic interaction

391
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,399
Network for which uh giving premiums or

392
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,880
increasing the prices of sustainable

393
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,360
Goods is going to again backfire it's

394
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,120
going to increase the total

395
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,399
unsustainable effort right so the

396
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,000
takeaway here is that to suppress the

397
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,440
total amount of unsustainable production

398
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,800
in the network it is not only sufficient

399
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,399
but it is also necessary to eliminate or

400
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,120
at least limit the cross activity

401
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,720
interactions the covert interactions

402
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,040
that take place between sustainable and

403
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,839
unsustainable plantations now in reality

404
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,880
what happens is the sustainable

405
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,160
plantations typically belong to U listed

406
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,760
companies and well reputed companies

407
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,160
that have uh obtained sustainability

408
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,120
certification from um auditing

409
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,760
organizations like the round table on

410
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,439
sustainable palm oil whereas

411
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,120
unsustainable plantations typically

412
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,199
belong to Shadow companies or companies

413
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,079
that are not listed anywhere and they

414
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,520
operate illegally and covertly under the

415
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,679
protection of listed companies so it is

416
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,760
absolutely essential to detect and

417
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,960
thwart the illegal and C operations of

418
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,200
the Shadow companies in order to make

419
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,440
sure that sustainability premiums are

420
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,400
actually helping rather than hurting the

421
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,600
cause of the environment so uh yeah

422
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,919
please please let me know if you have

423
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,919
any questions because I think uh at this

424
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,960
point I should answer any

425
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:53,000
questions uh that you may have and how

426
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:57,039
much time do we have 5 minutes oh well

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,480
actually about 8 minutes okay cool so

428
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,080
moving on uh

429
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,080
we are going to design policies that

430
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,080
will involve a combination of premiums

431
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,000
and penalties but premiums which means

432
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,280
raises to the prices of sustainable

433
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,360
Goods these are going to be an important

434
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,880
part of our policies and to make sure

435
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,000
that these sustainability premiums work

436
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,480
in our policies we are going to assume

437
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,039
that cross activity interactions may

438
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,559
exist but they are weak enough they are

439
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,080
dominated by interactivity interactions

440
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,159
right so that's the uh so in other words

441
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,640
we are assuming that these inter actions

442
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:34,600
between the uh listed companies and

443
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,440
Shadow companies are already being

444
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,240
detected and

445
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,320
suppressed so now with that background

446
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,200
let us uh introduce the intervention

447
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,600
design problem which is basically the

448
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,720
policy design problem so like I said our

449
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,240
goal is to maximize the total well-being

450
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,080
of the network which we call welfare at

451
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,159
the Nash equilibrium of the game which

452
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,240
we can prove to be unique but that's not

453
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,960
really the focus of this talk so

454
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,679
basically maximizing equilibrium welfare

455
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,559
while keeping a cap on the total amount

456
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,360
of unsustainable production in the

457
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:12,280
network right so here for for this uh

458
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,080
for the uh purpose of this slide let us

459
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,880
Focus only on premiums and let's not

460
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,520
focus on penalties we'll introduce

461
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,720
penalties later so if we are focusing

462
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,760
only on premiums which this means that

463
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,559
we are not changing the prices of

464
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,799
unsustainable Goods because we are not

465
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,120
imposing any penalties all we are doing

466
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,520
is we are making the decision VAR ables

467
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,960
the prices of sustainable Goods right we

468
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
are only increasing the prices of

469
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,520
sustainable Goods not changing

470
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,159
unsustainable good prices so the

471
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,760
objective function is the sum of all the

472
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,919
agents equilibrium utilities which is

473
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,520
the total

474
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,240
welfare the the first constraint is the

475
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,080
tolerance constraint on the total

476
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,400
unsustainable production right it says

477
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,919
that the sum total of all the agents

478
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,200
unsustainable effort levels at

479
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,919
equilibrium should be no more uh than a

480
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,039
certain predefined quantity uh and I

481
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,919
should I mean just to put things into

482
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,400
symbols the welfare expression is the

483
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,880
sum of all utilities which depends on a

484
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,799
lot of different quantities and the

485
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,360
tolerance constraint looks like that

486
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,919
because it's the left hand side is a sum

487
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,799
of all unsustainable effort levels now

488
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,520
the next constraint is just saying that

489
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,159
the prices of sustainable Goods after

490
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,320
your policy is implemented should be

491
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:28,280
greater not less than the uh prices

492
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,480
before your policy was implemented right

493
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,559
because it does not make sense to reduce

494
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,039
the incentive for sustainable production

495
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,559
so in other words this is a non-

496
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,559
negative premiums constraint the

497
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:40,440
sustainability premium should be non-

498
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:44,200
negative and in symbols it looks like

499
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,600
that where PA is basically the prices of

500
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,559
sustainable Goods so remember that a

501
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,960
stands for sustainable production and

502
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,240
zero here just stands for the

503
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,760
pre-intervention scenario which means

504
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,159
the scenario before the policy was

505
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,520
implemented initial case then uh the

506
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,559
last constraint is just saying that you

507
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,400
cannot go on uh increasing the prices of

508
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,600
sustainable Goods arbitrarily there will

509
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,440
be a finite budget uh and this budget is

510
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
coming from what we call maximum

511
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,559
feasible prices so basically this last

512
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,039
constraint is just a budget constraint

513
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,559
and in symbols it looks like that where

514
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:24,840
pmax is the upper bound on the prices of

515
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,200
sustainable Goods now uh at this point I

516
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,760
I should mention that this intervention

517
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,120
this optimization problem that we have

518
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,880
formulated is not restricted to the

519
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,880
context of forest management u in any

520
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,440
economic context where we would like to

521
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,640
suppress a harmful activity and uh you

522
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,840
know promote a desirable activity uh in

523
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,559
a manner that does not really hurt the

524
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,760
well-being of the stakeholders that are

525
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,320
involved in the activities uh even if

526
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,320
the stakeholders are interacting over a

527
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,880
network we we can use this optimization

528
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,720
setup for example in the context of uh

529
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,159
social media platforms that generate a

530
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,240
lot of content some of which can be true

531
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,720
genuine news or um you know fact checked

532
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,679
information the other the bad activity

533
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
can be the production of fake news or

534
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,159
misinformation the good activity can

535
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,799
also be the uh production of consumable

536
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,960
content that is safe you know in terms

537
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,520
of its non- extremism and the bad

538
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,720
activity can be the production of very

539
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,640
sensitive and extremist content we could

540
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,600
also think of u a context uh involving

541
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,440
the Pharma industry where the good

542
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,760
activity can be thought of as uh produ

543
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,039
the production of acceptable and drugs

544
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,360
that are safe to consume whereas the bad

545
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,000
activity becomes the production of

546
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,039
adulterated medicines and in all these

547
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,480
cases the uh the stakeholders can be

548
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:51,360
interacting with each other in the case

549
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,720
of uh platforms the content generators

550
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,520
might interact with each other and in

551
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,039
the case of Pharma companies we know

552
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,480
that these companies often collaborate

553
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,279
with each other to produce drugs so

554
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,840
Network interactions are present and

555
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,840
this optimization problem is of value

556
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,559
now the technical challenges here are

557
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,080
that this game is not super modular

558
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,760
which uh which basically means that the

559
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,440
utilities are not necessarily increasing

560
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,679
in the effort levels in a loose sense in

561
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
every agent's effort levels I mean then

562
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,480
the effort levels have to be non-

563
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,240
negative which means that non- interior

564
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,440
equilibria are possible I'm just rushing

565
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,279
through this part because I want to

566
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,520
focus on the main results uh and the

567
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,919
problem most important the problem is a

568
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,320
non-convex optimization problem it is a

569
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:37,120
problem in which the objective function

570
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,159
is a concave function not a convex

571
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,480
function so uh the main Insight that we

572
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,360
use here is that the welfare which is

573
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,320
our objective function it is increasing

574
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,240
in two quantities it is increasing in

575
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,000
the sum of the prices of sustainable and

576
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,799
unsustainable Goods taken per unit and

577
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,559
it's also increasing the in the

578
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,919
magnitude of the difference between the

579
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,159
two prices now the sum of the two prices

580
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,000
is the total incentive for production

581
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,000
and it makes sense that if the total

582
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
incentive for production goes up then

583
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,080
the total reward that is earned by the

584
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,400
agents for the same level of effort will

585
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,520
go up and that's why it makes sense for

586
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,159
welfare to be increasing in the total

587
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,559
incentive right the greater the total

588
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:20,159
incentive the better but the incentive

589
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,039
skew also matters why because the

590
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,240
greater the difference between the two

591
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,200
prices the prices of sustainable goods

592
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,919
and those of unsustainable Goods the

593
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,440
more uh the more strongly in lined the

594
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,960
agents will be towards one of the two

595
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,960
activities right and uh then their

596
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,960
division of effort and labor will be

597
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,399
minimal they'll concentrate their effort

598
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,840
on one activity and the uh utility loss

599
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:45,840
due to substitutability will go down

600
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,600
right so so so the welfare also turns

601
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,039
out to be increasing in the incentive

602
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,120
skew and uh then U yeah I think uh for

603
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,240
lack of time I I'm just going to go to

604
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,720
the main result so suppose we are trying

605
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,080
to solve the problem that described when

606
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,159
we do not have enough budget when uh

607
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,919
there is no room or very little room for

608
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,000
increasing the prices of sustainable

609
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,840
Goods then what do we do we basically

610
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,039
impose penalties for unsustainable

611
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,559
production and convert those penalties

612
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,080
into premiums for sustainable production

613
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,760
right so by penalties what I mean is

614
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,840
reducing the prices of unsustainable

615
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,320
Goods by a quantity row which is the

616
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,559
penalty and adding that row to the price

617
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,200
prices of sustainable Goods so

618
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,080
essentially we are just talking about a

619
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,640
transfer of incentives from activity B

620
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,159
the bad activity to the good activity

621
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,360
right so this obviously should preserve

622
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,679
the total incentive for production right

623
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,120
because there's only a transfer of

624
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,840
incentive that we are doing over here we

625
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,559
are not reducing the incentive and uh

626
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,440
does it the now the question is does it

627
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,960
increase the second important quantity

628
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,679
which is incentive Q does it do that or

629
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,760
not so it turns out that if we uh

630
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:07,399
transfer enough from B to a which means

631
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:11,000
if our penalty is large enough and uh if

632
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:14,039
our budget that we pour into the system

633
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,320
externally which uh which you know

634
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,480
contributes to the incentive for

635
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,640
activity a if that is also large enough

636
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,320
which precisely means that if the sum of

637
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,720
the penalty and half the budget is large

638
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,399
enough to satisfy a certain inequality

639
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,000
then it means that the penalties and

640
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:33,960
budget are jointly sufficient to

641
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,080
increase the incentive skew and the

642
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,520
result here is that if this inequality

643
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:43,640
holds then uh the the budget and the

644
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,320
penalty are together sufficient enough

645
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,880
to make sure that the most extreme

646
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,720
policy or the policy that imposes the

647
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,640
maximum feasible penalty and also uh

648
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,240
Awards the maximum feasible premium for

649
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,799
sustainable production that is the

650
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,440
policy that Max maximizes welfare and

651
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,840
also reduces all the agents individual

652
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,440
unsustainable effort levels while

653
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,399
preserving individual utility so this is

654
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,200
something uh so there are three things

655
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:14,200
that we are talking about here the first

656
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,039
thing is that uh we have a policy that

657
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,520
is maximizing our objective function

658
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,600
which is welfare which is the well-being

659
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,520
of the network which is what we wanted

660
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,480
then the second thing is that every

661
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,240
agent's individual unsustainable effort

662
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,520
levels are going down right uh they are

663
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,320
being minimized which is is also

664
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,480
something that we wanted because we

665
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,919
wanted the total unsustainable effort to

666
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,159
remain remain below uh predefined

667
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,320
tolerance and it is giving us something

668
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,600
more than we asked for which is that it

669
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,039
is preserving every preserving or

670
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,159
increasing every agent's individual

671
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,559
utility so remember that the welfare is

672
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:50,080
the sum of all the agents utilities

673
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,159
right it is the sum it is not any one

674
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,720
agent utility so it is possible for the

675
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,960
sum of all the utilities to increase at

676
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,279
the expense of a few agents individual

677
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,320
utilities right it is in the in theory

678
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,679
it is possible but this result is saying

679
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,720
that that won't happen no agent will

680
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,919
lose out in terms of their individual

681
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,360
payoffs so basically we are able to

682
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,480
increase the total well-being of the

683
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,799
network without hurting any individual

684
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,919
agent that's the takeaway so I think uh

685
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:21,480
I should quickly summarize uh what what

686
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,279
is the time uh a little bit over time so

687
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,000
uh yeah I think I'll just wrap up in one

688
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:32,440
minute so basically we uh have we have

689
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,799
some empirical results that we uh uh

690
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,559
that we obtained on validating our

691
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,000
theory on some real data sets obtained

692
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,399
from the plantation networks of

693
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,799
Indonesia as well as the price data

694
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:46,360
associated with certified sustainable

695
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,279
palm oil and crude palm oil which are

696
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,919
which basically correspond to

697
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:53,200
sustainable products and unsustainable

698
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,559
products in our context and uh we we

699
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,360
observe an improvement in both the

700
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,559
welfare the predicted welfare I should

701
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,120
say and the predicted reduction in

702
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:06,080
unsustainable effort uh as predicted by

703
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,559
uh our model so the the empirical

704
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,720
results in some sense validate our

705
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,880
Theory and the conclusion is uh and then

706
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,000
we have our policy recommendations which

707
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,480
basically discriminate on the basis of

708
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,200
whether the budget and the penalty are

709
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,840
together enough or not and uh if so if

710
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,600
they are together jointly sufficient

711
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,640
then basically we need to go for a

712
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,519
certain kind of policies if they are

713
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,240
together jointly insufficient then we

714
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,720
need to go for a different kind of

715
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,000
policies and the conclusion is that the

716
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,080
first result was that we absolutely need

717
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,080
to suppress the covert interactions

718
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,120
between sustainable plantations and

719
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,679
unsustainable plantations otherwise our

720
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,880
sustainability premiums will backfire

721
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,440
and the second uh point is that the

722
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,279
redistribution of prices which is

723
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,679
basically the imposing penalties and

724
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,000
converting those penalties into premiums

725
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,279
that improves welfare and reduces

726
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,399
unsustainable efforts without hurting

727
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,720
any agent individually even if the

728
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,480
external budget for price increases is

729
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,600
zero right even if we are not pouring

730
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,600
any external money from outside into the

731
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,679
system so this has implications for uh

732
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,840
Partnerships in other economic context

733
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,760
as well wherever we need to uh promote

734
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,799
sustainability without hurting the

735
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,679
overall well-being of the participants

736
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,840
this uh optimization framework should be

737
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,840
of value so thank you very

738
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,320
[Applause]

739
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,279
much uh um we're a bit over time so if

740
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,480
anyone has to leave that's fine but

741
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,559
otherwise feel free to ask

742
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,960
questions has any

743
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,320
questions yes please how do you come up

744
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,080
with in your Indonesia example with the

745
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,360
values of the of the interaction

746
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,720
coefficients and thanks yeah that's

747
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,559
that's actually a good question so yeah

748
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,159
so these interaction coefficients you

749
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,440
are absolutely right that uh we do not

750
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,039
yet have a very rigorous method of

751
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,559
coming up with these values but we

752
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,760
tested these uh I mean you we basically

753
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,039
ran our empirical analysis with a range

754
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,679
of values and over here we are just

755
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,159
displaying the results corresponding to

756
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,679
a particular choice of values uh just to

757
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,960
you know clearly show all the

758
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,480
qualitative results but uh but the

759
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,080
results are the you know qualitatively

760
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,279
the results are not really dependent on

761
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,120
the values of those quantities they

762
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:28,480
continue to hold for a range of values

763
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,519
meaning our policies will promise a

764
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,200
certain level of welfare Improvement and

765
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,200
a certain reduction in total

766
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,039
unsustainable effort regardless of the

767
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,039
value of those

768
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,039
parameters

769
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,960
yeah you you have a question or yeah

770
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,799
yeah sure um so is there uh literature I

771
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,840
me prior literature on incentive design

772
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,120
on networks with synergistic interaction

773
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,200
so I guess um yeah there is uh quite a

774
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,679
bit of literature on Intervention design

775
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,200
uh in Network games with synergistic

776
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,679
interactions such as the paper by core

777
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,000
and zo which is basically Ryan core and

778
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,559
junji Zoo it was published in games and

779
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,639
economic behavior uh just 2 years ago

780
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,320
but this is the first time that uh

781
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,880
anyone has done inter intervention

782
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,960
design on coupled activity Network game

783
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,760
so all the previous Works focus on the

784
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,840
case of just one activity and uh well

785
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,279
actually uh just just a minute yeah

786
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,039
sorry uh cor andu is uh the the first

787
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:31,000
work that focuses on coupled activi

788
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:33,279
games but it treats both the activities

789
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,760
in the same way in the sense that either

790
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,559
both the activities are desirable or

791
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,159
both are undesirable it does not really

792
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,760
discriminate between the two activities

793
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,679
so their problem formulation is somewhat

794
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,559
symmetric and easier in some sense to

795
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,799
handle whereas ours is a little

796
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,399
asymmetric over here yeah yeah but

797
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,399
that's a good

798
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,919
question yes please but assuming you

799
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,120
know the T the interaction coefficient

800
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,840
like wouldn't it make sense to have um

801
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,200
penalties and and and premiums that also

802
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:08,840
depend on interaction coefficient as in

803
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,519
you know I am sustainable but I I I keep

804
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,639
interacting with other guys that are not

805
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,799
sustainable so why do I get the same

806
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:17,600
premium as others that like stick to to

807
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:20,679
to collaborations with other sustainable

808
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,360
guys uh yeah that's a valard point so

809
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,679
what happens is uh when the when your

810
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,559
interactions with unsustainable guys so

811
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,480
suppose you are a sustainable agent and

812
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,799
your

813
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,600
interaction with those who are too much

814
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,399
into unsustainable production if the

815
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,000
interaction is very high then it means

816
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,279
that the cross activity interactions are

817
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,639
very high and then premiums no longer

818
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:44,080
work you absolutely have to impose

819
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,600
penalties right but but uh like I said

820
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,039
we are focusing primarily on the case in

821
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,519
which the cross activity interactions or

822
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,480
you know the interactions between

823
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,639
sustainable producers and unsustainable

824
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,000
producers are being uh suppressed to a

825
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:00,679
level where the problem becomes more

826
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,919
manageable so let me show you that yeah

827
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,440
basically we are we are assuming that

828
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:06,799
the inactivity interactions are much

829
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,800
stronger than the cross activated

830
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,000
interactions for all our results but

831
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,480
you're right that in general the

832
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,480
solution could depend on the interaction

833
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,480
parameters

834
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,480
absolutely

835
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:30,280
yes yes please you that individual

836
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,280
not

837
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:42,280
down oh how did we ensure yeah uh

838
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,200
so the reason is basically U so you're

839
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,800
talking I think you're talking about

840
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,800
this

841
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,879
uh you're talking about this part really

842
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:57,839
right uh yeah so yeah it's a good

843
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:01,720
question we we basically uh trade these

844
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,359
incentive skes and so so I should just

845
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,280
briefly go back to the previous slide

846
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,640
and remind you that U that the welfare

847
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,440
is increasing in these two quantities

848
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,839
right now these two quantities are

849
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,760
actually vectors they are not scalars

850
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,839
and the length of these vectors is equal

851
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,079
to the number of Agents so basically

852
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:23,880
every agent has a total incentive for

853
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:26,920
production and a total um not total but

854
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,359
a skew or a bias uh in incentive towards

855
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,760
one of the two activ so basically we we

856
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:36,280
were able to prove that uh if this if

857
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,599
this budget penalty condition holds then

858
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,440
uh the total incentive of every agent

859
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,079
will be preserved and the incentive skew

860
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,960
of every agent goes up so so that's how

861
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,880
we were able to show that no agent

862
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,520
individual utility goes down so it's

863
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,160
more of a scalar analysis at that point

864
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,960
but uh but yeah it also involves a lot

865
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,640
of Matrix analysis and up to a certain

866
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,400
point in the in the proof but basically

867
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,520
Bally the incentive skewes and the total

868
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,680
incentives do not change across all the

869
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,839
agents they either decrease sorry they

870
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,359
either increase or remain the same uh

871
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,520
and this statement is true for every

872
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,480
agent individually that's how it works

873
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,480
yeah yeah but that's a good

874
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,680
point very well if there are no other

875
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:26,599
questions let's thank our speaker again

876
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:29,560
yes thank you so much thanks a lot thank

877
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,560
you thanks

878
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,119
thanks for your

879
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,960
help yeah

880
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,960
the thanks for the questions
