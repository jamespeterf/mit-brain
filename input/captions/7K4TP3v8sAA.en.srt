00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,550
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob Stoner and

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:14,770
this is what if it

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:14,770
[Music]

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,080
works from the MIT energy initiative

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
this is what if it works a podcast

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,160
looking at the energy solutions for

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,599
climate change I'm Cara Miller you might

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,599
know me from the public radio program

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,279
Innovation Hub which I hosted and now

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,880
write the big idea column for the Boston

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,440
Globe and I'm Robert Stoner the

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,660
president of the Kendall Square project

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,600
and former director of the MIT energy

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,760
[Music]

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,200
initiative good to see you cara good to

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,640
see you too so let's talk about why

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,039
we're doing this podcast and I know you

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,600
kind of wanted to start off with a story

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,520
here well you know I'm in the business

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,120
of finding solutions to climate change

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,039
finding those lowc carbon technologies

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,600
that are going to enable us to move the

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
economy of the world into a very

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,199
different place I'm optimistic about it

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,039
I mean you got to get up in the morning

26
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,920
and do this stuff every single day and

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,560
it's how I feel but I'm always surprised

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,920
and disappointed and worried when I see

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,799
people who often young people very very

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
worried upset even I got into a cab this

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
morning coming back from the

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,439
airport with a guy who was worried that

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
there wasn't going to be enough food if

34
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,280
climate change kept on going um somebody

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
the other day was telling me that they

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,240
were worried about their house being

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,280
washed away in the flood that's not

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,920
what's going to happen for one thing the

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,640
time frame is a lot longer and for

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
another thing we really have a lot of

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,439
great ideas and technologies that we're

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
moving forward quickly so a question

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,040
about the technology you're a

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,280
professional here I'm not to what degree

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,520
do we have the solutions like are the

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,000
solutions to climate change still in the

47
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,360
lab still being worked out or do they

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,759
exist it's just people haven't thrown

49
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,840
enough money at the problem and haven't

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,119
scaled it up yes yes and yes so I mean

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,520
we have to keep all of these thoughts in

52
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,799
our minds right yes

53
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,240
we have maybe not all of the solutions

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,840
we have a lot of solutions and they're

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,280
good Solutions yes people are still in

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
the labs and they need to be working in

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,080
the labs and yes we're implementing all

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,080
these Solutions the problem is that many

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,760
of them well they all require an

60
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,400
investment of some kind very often

61
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,560
they're replacing something that's still

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
perfectly good we have to throw it away

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,239
that has an economic cost it affects us

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,599
it affects how we can live it affects

65
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,040
our ability to apply those resources to

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,599
other things that would improve our

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,080
lives in other ways

68
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,280
so these are nuanced issues and they

69
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,599
have to be approached that way in other

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
cases the Technologies are there but

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,720
they don't work together well and we

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,280
haven't figured out how to put them

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
together in an efficient way and the

74
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,720
obvious example of that is our

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,080
electricity system where we're trying to

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,640
add a lot of solar and wind they don't

77
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,879
produce any carbon they're relatively

78
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,280
cheap now and we can put them up

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,879
everywhere but the sun doesn't always

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,519
shine and the wind doesn't always blow

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,440
as they say so we need batteries and

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,640
those batteries are too expensive and we

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,760
need too many of them with the way we

84
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,319
operate the system we're not really

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,280
adjusting our demand to match that

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,360
intermittent generation so somebody said

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,200
to you you know here's a bunch of money

88
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,360
but you can only play with the pieces on

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,159
the chess board right now like we're not

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,640
going to develop anything more in the

91
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,879
lab we're not going to do any more of

92
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,599
the basic research we're done with that

93
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:32,560
do you think the technology that exists

94
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:35,760
is enough to to address climate change

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,760
no no okay no no and you know it it's a

96
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,239
big piece of it but there's a lot more

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,319
that needs to be done yeah I mean I was

98
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,280
just talking about the electricity

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,120
system there's a lot more to the Energy

100
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,200
System than the electricity system we

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,319
use energy in all kinds of ways we heat

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,560
our homes with it you know I burned

103
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,680
natural gas in my apartment in Boston

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,599
and in our summer house we burn wood in

105
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,280
the stove those things all emit CO2 and

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,120
they represent a lot more energy than I

107
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,840
use at least in the form of electricity

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,000
and so we have to find ways to replace

109
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,799
those too so electrifying everything is

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,319
a great idea and at the same time

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,239
deploying a lot of zeroc carbon

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,160
electricity generation solar wind

113
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,919
nuclear but we've got to find ways to

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,959
decarbonize other parts of the

115
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,720
transportation system than just personal

116
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,600
cars that work pretty well as EVS we've

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
got to find a way to decarbonize

118
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,320
Industry all the things we make that

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,039
produce CO2 because they

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,080
is really a problem because it not only

121
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,960
consumes natural gas to produce the heat

122
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,199
that's required which emits CO2 into the

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,560
atmosphere but that chemical reaction

124
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,479
that takes place creates CO2 and so we

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,759
even need a different material in that

126
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,000
case so I know one of the things we're

127
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,520
going to do over the many episodes of

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,199
this podcast is we're going to look at

129
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,400
like all these different Technologies

130
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,280
but also funding but just since you

131
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,240
mentioned cement let me just Dive Right

132
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,520
In you know I once had somebody say to

133
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,120
me who invests in Green Technology

134
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,120
investors like Investments they can

135
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,199
understand something like you know

136
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,560
electric vehicles is kind of like a sexy

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,240
technology and like cement I don't know

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,120
not super sexy generally do you think

139
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,120
that there's a problem where there's a

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,240
misalignment of what people are throwing

141
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,240
money at and what they should be

142
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,319
throwing money yet absolutely okay um

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,479
cuz most of us are just like not there

144
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,360
in the back rooms and we don't

145
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,720
I know people assume that if there's a

146
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,319
lot of money being thrown at electric

147
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,840
cars maybe like that's the problem and

148
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,000
that'll solve everything if we switch

149
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,080
over well let me give you a more

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,360
sophisticated answer than

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
absolutely we you know a lot of the

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,319
problems that are represented by the

153
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,520
things that we need to change right now

154
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,080
like electric cars are easy to

155
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,039
understand we have cars and we need to

156
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,880
not use internal combustion engines

157
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,639
anymore and fuel we need to use electric

158
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,240
cars so we need batteries so an investor

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
can understand that I have an new

160
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,440
battery technology and I want you to

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,240
invest in it and they can understand

162
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,360
they can sell those batteries for new

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,479
cars but then there are other things

164
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,919
that we're going to need in the future

165
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,039
for which there aren't currently markets

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,199
things like long duration storage

167
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,759
batteries for the Grid or um you know

168
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,759
direct air capture of carbon dioxide

169
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,319
from the atmosphere both things we

170
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,960
really really need but there isn't a big

171
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,960
market for them right now so the first

172
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,199
thing the long duration storage

173
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,520
batteries is that like oh we captured a

174
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,680
whole bunch of solar from this you know

175
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,960
solar farm in in Arizona but we need to

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,960
like put that somewhere so that we can

177
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,720
transport it or we can keep it for the

178
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,520
night time or whatever is that yeah and

179
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,479
return it to the grid right exactly and

180
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,680
the more the grid is decarbonized with

181
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,280
solar and wind the more storage you need

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,319
now we're at an early stage though in

183
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,759
deploying solar and wind it's still a

184
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,080
relatively small fraction of our total

185
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,240
electricity Supply so we can deal with

186
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,960
the inter mcy just by turning up and

187
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,160
turning down the existing generation

188
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,199
systems we have the gas and with

189
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,720
fortunately uh less and less frequency

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,520
the coal plants that are still out there

191
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,759
so just to like get back to this

192
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,960
hopelessness question if some of the

193
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,120
technology has not been developed if a

194
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,520
lot of it has not been scaled in the way

195
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,280
that it should be if people are not

196
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,240
necessarily deploying money towards the

197
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,879
right things and we've already seen

198
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,599
these massive heat waves and we've seen

199
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,160
the Earth Heating up what makes you

200
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,639
hopeful because that doesn't sound

201
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,319
necessarily like a recipe for hope so

202
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,879
tell me like what makes you I know

203
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,240
you're a very hopeful person so like

204
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,039
what makes you hopeful I grow up hopeful

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,159
every day I get up hopeful every day but

206
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,840
well I I think it's a question of

207
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,080
thinking about what where are we going

208
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,240
to get to I mean what what is the

209
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,720
objective here the bad news is that

210
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,360
we're very close to the 1.5 degree

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,759
threshold that people are concerned

212
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,120
about and it's a real threshold that's

213
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,680
not an arbitrary number it it represents

214
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,000
a temperature Beyond which the CO2

215
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,960
concentration in the atmosphere is

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,080
probably so high that we won't be able

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,199
to get it a temperature back down to

218
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,720
where it was earlier in the century if

219
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,879
we go beyond it to two it kind of hangs

220
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,639
around too and it might float up a

221
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,840
little bit take a long long time to come

222
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,159
back down again so this's a sort of a a

223
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,440
transition that occurs there so what

224
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:29,120
we're trying to do here is stay as close

225
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,000
to that threshold as we can not go far

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,039
beyond it and also give ourselves time

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,919
to adapt to the changes that are going

228
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,599
to occur it's already warmer it's going

229
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,800
to get warmer right water's going to get

230
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,519
higher people are going to have to move

231
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,880
because agricultural productivity is

232
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,279
going to shift around it's not going to

233
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,080
go away and the more time we give

234
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,440
ourselves to shift around with that

235
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,839
productive capacity and and other

236
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,600
aspects of the way we live the less

237
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,959
stress there will be on society trying

238
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,880
to do it very quickly creat stresses of

239
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,399
of another kind I and we're all familiar

240
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,000
with the the life issue that people are

241
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,399
confronting in the in the midwest that

242
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
has become a political issue of the

243
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,079
decline of industries that use

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,320
conventional energy if you you know push

245
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,519
very aggressively to shut those

246
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,279
Industries down those people really

247
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,079
suffer and they suffer just exactly in

248
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,519
the same way they're going to suffer a

249
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:28,560
100 years in the future as a result of a

250
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,000
global temperature rise so you know one

251
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,720
of the big questions I have about this

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,560
is human behavior and sort of how you

253
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,279
innovate around human behavior it seems

254
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,519
like asking people it's not like

255
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,920
vegetarianism is new for example and yet

256
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,519
when you look at like the percentage of

257
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,240
Americans that are vegetarian it's very

258
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,760
small I'm I'm not sure 5% less something

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,240
like that I also look at the cars around

260
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,880
me I feel like during my lifetime

261
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,240
they've gotten really really big now

262
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,079
they're they're just a lot of huge huge

263
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,959
cars so

264
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,160
I think many

265
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,519
people both who eat meat and who drive

266
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,720
big cars will tell you they do care

267
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,320
about the environment so I also feel

268
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,920
like one of the big questions is do we

269
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,440
have to kind of innovate around human

270
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,120
behavior you know what I mean because

271
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,240
human behavior seems to be like looking

272
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,440
for comfort and looking for what feels

273
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,480
good and it's hard to it's hard to like

274
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,720
cut things out of your life yeah we are

275
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,480
the people we are and somehow though we

276
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,680
people in North America don't think of

277
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,839
things the same way that they do in

278
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,120
Europe or in many parts of Asia as well

279
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,760
I mean they they have made choices and

280
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,360
we have to make choices too it's not

281
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,320
necessarily a question of being better

282
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,959
it's a question of being more thoughtful

283
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,519
about the choices we have before us and

284
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
maybe to some extent thinking about our

285
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,360
children and and their Futures they

286
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,040
don't have to be bad choices though it's

287
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,120
not like we have to decide to start

288
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,880
wearing hair shirts I mean EVS are

289
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,800
pretty cool um Heat pumps are pretty

290
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,000
cool I mean energy efficient buildings

291
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,720
are pretty cool and warm depending on

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,519
what you need so we shouldn't hide from

293
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,519
these choices I mean the society really

294
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,360
has to engage with them and and get on

295
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,079
with it we develop policy and programs

296
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,600
that are you know intended to drive

297
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,920
people toward these sorts of choices and

298
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,480
you're right they seem to be kind of

299
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,120
ineffective sometimes I mean on the on

300
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,720
the other hand like when you talk about

301
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,639
policies you think about like the energy

302
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,639
saver sticker that you see on washing

303
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,839
machines like you can also from from a

304
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,399
governmental level I guess say

305
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,040
California is doing this we're only

306
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,360
going to sell this kind of car or we're

307
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,959
only going to sell cars with this m

308
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,560
gallon or above so whatever you choose

309
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,000
you can choose anything but 15 miles a

310
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,079
gallon you can't choose you're right you

311
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,680
know President Biden came out recently

312
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:53,399
with with a a new policy that is trying

313
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,680
to constrain car companies to produce

314
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,920
cars that are less emitting overall it's

315
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,399
not requiring people to buy electric

316
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,279
cars and it's not requiring car

317
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
companies to make electric cars it's

318
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,120
just saying that overall you got to make

319
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,760
cars that have lower emissions as a

320
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
fleet you can try to do that and and

321
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,079
it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do

322
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,800
it doesn't force people to give up their

323
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,800
internal combustion engines it does sort

324
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,519
of push Society in a particular

325
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,920
direction and and those sorts of

326
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,040
Standards which are called Cafe

327
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,880
standards have been very effective in

328
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,560
cleaning up the American Automotive

329
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,000
system we still tend to favor these

330
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,160
gigantic cars right you know and the the

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,279
electric Hummers is just sort of a

332
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,079
classic example of what are we thinking

333
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,720
so then when you think about human

334
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:45,079
behavior and how science thinks about

335
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,000
that and tries to mitigate climate

336
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,279
change when you get together with

337
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,920
Scientists what do what do they say in

338
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,360
terms of I mean because you you actually

339
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
have to have something for a lot of

340
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,279
people depends on what what it if you're

341
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,560
a government regulator it's different

342
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,880
but like if you're creating something

343
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,160
that's coming through the market you

344
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
have to have something that people want

345
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,560
so if you're like here I'm selling this

346
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,680
very tiny car and people like yeah I'm

347
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,079
not really that interested in that

348
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,639
that's not I mean that's not going to

349
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,120
work yeah but we know we don't invent

350
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:15,079
cars at MIT well not we focus on the

351
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,160
technologies that enable cars to run

352
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,760
cleaner and so we're not trying to make

353
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,800
those choices for people we we're in the

354
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,399
business of trying to create options for

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,079
people to be able to choose but you do

356
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,000
have to choose I have a colleague a very

357
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,360
close colleague who I won't name uh who

358
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,120
drove around a chef Dey Suburban for

359
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,839
many years an old one drove it all the

360
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,000
way from California to come to MIT to

361
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,720
join the faculty and its license plate

362
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,320
was tax CO2 in other words I'm not going

363
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,079
to make that choice unless there's a

364
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,920
policy that forces me to make that

365
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,399
choice and I think the reason is

366
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,360
interesting I'm not going to make that

367
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,680
choice myself alone unless I know that

368
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,040
everybody else has to make that choice

369
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,839
too and suffer in the same way and I'm

370
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,360
not ready to get rid of my car my car's

371
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,639
not that old I'm going to hang on to it

372
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,720
for a few more years so you know back

373
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,000
off about me driving this big car this a

374
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,880
reality that we live in it's interesting

375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,720
about that car that issue of the carbon

376
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,519
tax because I talked to a couple

377
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,560
economists a Republican and a Democrat a

378
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,560
few years ago and what shocked me was

379
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,360
that they agreed there should be a

380
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,160
carbon tax and as far as I can tell

381
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,320
there is zero Traction in any sort of

382
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,639
carbon tax like in National politics I

383
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,560
can't imagine people just don't really

384
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,519
like taxes so I don't know that doesn't

385
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,680
seem like an idea that's getting the

386
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,040
ground but it what just shocked me was

387
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,240
that people on like academics on either

388
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,800
side of the aisle were like yeah it's

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,639
obvious we should totally do that it is

390
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,440
obvious I mean it's the it's the obvious

391
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,120
thing to do if you tax CO2 emissions

392
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,000
then you know people will emit less it's

393
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,759
exactly what you should do we do use the

394
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,279
tax system but we use it to provide tax

395
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,639
credits you know we've got this system

396
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,800
now of carrots no sticks uh as provided

397
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,279
by the these two major pieces of

398
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,360
legislation the inflation reduction Act

399
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,880
and the bipartisan infrastructure law

400
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,399
which is not bipartisan and the

401
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,800
inflation reduction act isn't very

402
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,199
inflationary reduction either but but

403
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,040
they're good at naming things in DC

404
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,040
accurate naming so the you know the

405
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
federal government has said that's the

406
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,759
way we're going to go we're going to try

407
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,959
to incentivize people to do the right

408
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:23,399
thing at the state level we have applied

409
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,360
not necessarily taxes but we've applied

410
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,120
mandates that say you got to have this

411
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,519
much zeroc carbon electricity in your

412
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,319
system and

413
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,360
it it's possible to trade in renewable

414
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:37,600
energy credits that are created through

415
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,800
those mandates to do something like

416
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,319
apply a tax to the industry force it to

417
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,720
go in a certain direction they've been

418
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,680
very effective the Canadians do have a

419
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,839
carbon tax and it's one that's going to

420
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,680
wind itself up to something like 170

421
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,160
bucks a ton wow okay by 2030 so it's a

422
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,440
very aggressive carbon tax and I I was

423
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,040
talking to a Canadian yesterday who was

424
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,480
complaining about it so it must be doing

425
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,160
something the Europeans are about to

426
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,160
Implement something called the carbon

427
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,959
border adjustment mechanism cbam which

428
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,360
is going to tax the CO2 associated with

429
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,600
products imported into the EU they're

430
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
going to say or washing machines or

431
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
whatever yeah China you're going to make

432
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,360
that product that we're trying to make

433
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,399
in the EU we're going to tax carbon in

434
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
the EU we're going to tax your products

435
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,279
as they come into the EU unless you're

436
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,880
going to either clean them up so they

437
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,880
don't have very much carbon in them or

438
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,560
tax them yourselves we're going to see

439
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,600
more of that and that kind of thinking I

440
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,519
think is is sort of almost dangerously

441
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,120
but intriguingly aligned with this sort

442
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,800
of tariff enthusiasm that certain

443
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,199
political candidates have

444
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,839
demonstrated so let me ask you a little

445
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,639
bit about China and India and actually

446
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,759
I've been hearing a ton about China uh

447
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,319
making electric cars that are a fraction

448
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,600
the price of what we have here but I

449
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:54,920
don't we don't have them here because um

450
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,279
because ter they have them in

451
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Europe but but yeah there's just a lot

452
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,079
of protectionism uh at least with cars

453
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,639
here but I think one thing you know we

454
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,600
were talking about this question of Hope

455
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,520
and do you have hope and on the question

456
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,120
of climate I think for a lot of people

457
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,160
um China and India Loom large in you

458
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,799
know a lot of people together almost

459
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,799
three billion people and they both have

460
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,600
Rising middle classes that want things

461
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,880
like air conditioners not surprisingly

462
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,400
it's hot and washing machines and like

463
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,319
the things we have so it's hard to say

464
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,559
don't have those things because they are

465
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,280
very energy hungry while we live in like

466
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,080
3,000 square foot homes and have air

467
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,440
conditioners you know but like again to

468
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,400
this question of Hope isn't it kind of

469
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,840
worrisome that so many people are sort

470
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,799
of moving up to the middle class and

471
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,600
wanting energy hungry appliances yeah

472
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,200
but that's a good thing no it is good it

473
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,760
is good of course so this is an example

474
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,160
it's like attention right yeah it's it's

475
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,039
attention exactly I mean gez I mean the

476
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,559
situations that they're emerging from of

477
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,600
grotesque poverty are the sorts of

478
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:03,000
things we fear in our future future as a

479
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,559
result of climate change so trying to

480
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,120
persuade them not to economically

481
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,159
develop so that we won't have a problem

482
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,159
in the future as absurd and and and it's

483
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,600
it's offensive to them and a losing

484
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,080
proposition probably nobody's going to

485
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,919
buy that and and we have in large part

486
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,679
exported our manufacturing related

487
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,440
emissions to these low-income countries

488
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,360
at the same time and to turn around now

489
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,520
and sort of insist that they decarbonize

490
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,120
themselves mindlessly is unfair we need

491
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,200
to encourage them to decarbonize

492
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,159
themselves and develop lowc carbon

493
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,240
economies but we're going to have to pay

494
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,600
them to do it we're going to have to

495
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,640
either pay more for the product so that

496
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,240
they can have carbon taxes within their

497
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,039
own Borders or we're going to have to

498
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,000
literally make transfers via the

499
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,200
multilateral and bilateral development

500
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,440
Banks the World Bank usaid and other

501
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,720
other organs of the US government to

502
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,960
make it possible for them to invest in

503
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,760
these Technologies when they have the

504
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,720
option to invest dirtier technologies

505
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,720
that cost less that's a really hard

506
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,240
thing to do and talk about a political

507
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,880
problem which of those things if either

508
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,799
or both do you see happening you think

509
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,520
about Walmart and how many things at

510
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,679
Walmart are made in China and you go in

511
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,760
to buy your blender or your bike or

512
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,559
whatever does that mean it's truly going

513
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,280
to be more expensive because we're

514
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,720
saying like we have to add on the toll

515
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,679
that's taking on the environment or are

516
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,080
we just going to transfer money to

517
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,480
people and say like here this this is to

518
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,280
scale up this technology I think things

519
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,799
are going to get more expensive okay the

520
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,559
blender is going to get more expensive I

521
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,159
mean we're very least even if these new

522
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,880
technologies cost less or the same as

523
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,000
the Technologies they're replacing very

524
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,640
often those Technologies still have a

525
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,240
lot of useful life in them like which

526
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,559
two which new technolog like a coal

527
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,919
Generation Plant in China for example

528
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,320
was built 10 years ago okay that plant

529
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,200
should last for 30 or 40 years for them

530
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,520
to turn that plant off means somebody's

531
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,080
not going to repay his bank loan that

532
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,840
they use to build that plant in the

533
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,080
first place so who's going to pay it the

534
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,240
government has to pay it or somehow

535
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,919
people who buy electricity will have to

536
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,320
absorb that financial burden through the

537
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,840
electricity rates that they pay so that

538
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,600
it can be paid off the money the debt

539
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,120
doesn't go away and so so this this

540
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,159
limits it introduces a sort of viscosity

541
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,240
into the rate at which we can we can

542
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,240
force these changes to happen they're

543
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,520
literally isn't enough money in the

544
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,280
world so a you know make stuff

545
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,159
cheaper uh B make choices in society

546
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,000
about where we're going to apply the

547
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:45,440
scarce resources that we can muster only

548
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,280
to climate change mitigation what about

549
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,559
education and Roads what about healthc

550
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,039
care uh what about space exploration

551
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,919
telecommunications I all all the other

552
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,679
things we got to do they're hard choices

553
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,360
so if we just go back to the coal fire

554
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,000
power plant in China That's being used

555
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,159
to you know make our blenders let's say

556
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,559
and the person who owns it is like doing

557
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,600
fine making money who is going to be the

558
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,679
person who says I know we can get 20

559
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,159
more years out of this but it is like

560
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,799
ruining the planet we should not do this

561
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,200
yeah well it has to be probably the

562
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,720
government and and the government has to

563
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,279
come to terms with that and would they

564
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,480
do that maybe or why would they do that

565
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,320
well because they begin to worry about

566
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,279
the impact of climate change and I think

567
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,919
maybe they begin to worry about things

568
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,279
like seam and the fact that they may no

569
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,559
longer be able to sell their goods

570
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:39,200
abroad which would have a tremendously

571
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,279
dilar effect on their on their economies

572
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,279
but there are other things they can do

573
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,200
as well and this is the kind of stuff we

574
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,799
work on at MIT and and people work on at

575
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,960
other places you can look at that coal

576
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,159
plant and say well what else can I do

577
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,520
with that coal plant maybe I can find a

578
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,799
way for it to continue to be a

579
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,720
productive asset but burn something else

580
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,120
maybe it can burn biomass and I can grow

581
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,760
more biomass and it will absorb CO2 from

582
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,600
the atmosphere and I can use it in that

583
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,520
plant that has happened in a sort of a

584
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,279
way in Europe and and it's it's possible

585
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,880
up to some level there's probably not

586
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,799
enough biomass to get very far in

587
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,159
dealing with that problem you could look

588
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,159
at gas plants you know of which we have

589
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,600
a great many in this country and say

590
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,919
well maybe we could burn something other

591
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,120
than gas in that gas turbine maybe we

592
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,000
could substitute ammonia which doesn't

593
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,360
contain carbon and when it burns it

594
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,400
doesn't prod produce CO2 produces other

595
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,880
stuff that you have to mitigate but

596
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,960
maybe there are other zero carbon fuels

597
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,440
we can find a way to use in those plants

598
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,000
and other plants to make those assets

599
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,600
work longer and reduce that burden the

600
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,440
Japanese are very very intent on this

601
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,720
they live in a world where they have

602
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,559
basically no primary energy resources

603
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
other than sun and wind right they're

604
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,760
not going to like drill for oil they

605
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,360
don't live they don't yeah exactly no

606
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,400
oil not even that much coal uh no

607
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,640
natural gas so they're importing all

608
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,720
these fossil fuels and that's very very

609
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,320
burdensome and very very different from

610
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,000
the situation in this country we've got

611
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,720
enormous amounts of gas we're the

612
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,279
biggest gas producer in the world

613
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,640
biggest exporter of gas in the world now

614
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:17,760
so they're very motivated to find other

615
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,080
ways to generate power and to use assets

616
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,039
and we're working with one of the

617
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,799
Japanese power manufacturers who trying

618
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,360
to figure out how to retrofit Machinery

619
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,679
around the world that they make to run

620
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,640
on ammonia instead of natural gas that

621
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,200
kind of innovation is really really

622
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,159
important and and it's coming from

623
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,960
outside the United States it's driven by

624
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,960
their shortage of

625
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,279
options the transformation of our Energy

626
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,559
Systems is very very different in every

627
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,559
country we all have a different set of

628
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:54,799
resources different sun and wind

629
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,559
different economies and each will take

630
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,039
its own

631
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:03,679
path the nature of of innovation which

632
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:06,440
is in part new technologies but also in

633
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,279
part systems and how things go together

634
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,000
will be driven by these very local needs

635
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:15,360
and we need to be watching it's a very

636
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,360
important driver of international

637
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,400
[Music]

638
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,799
cooperation let me just go back to this

639
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,080
question about India and China you've

640
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,799
been involved so much in international

641
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,760
discussions about climate change I know

642
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,120
China is the number one emitter right

643
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,080
now more than twice I think what the US

644
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,520
admits though I should say on a per

645
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,520
capita basis we still admit quite a bit

646
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:49,320
win yeah exact if that's a if that's a

647
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,760
prize you want to win then yes um do you

648
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,000
hear from those countries I mean you

649
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,120
were talking about Japan before and it's

650
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,919
just a much richer country I'm guessing

651
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,880
on a per capita basis than China what do

652
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,000
you hear from those countries do they

653
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,760
care about climate change because there

654
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,360
are pressing issues like you have to

655
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,919
care if people are going to eat next

656
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,960
week before you care if things are going

657
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,480
to be too hot five years from now you

658
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,679
know yeah it depends on the country I

659
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,440
mean we're talking about rich countries

660
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,080
when we're talking about Japan it's

661
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,440
still a very very large heavily

662
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,880
industrialized economy very highly

663
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,600
educated population very high standard

664
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,000
of

665
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,039
living they are motivated to mitigate

666
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,600
climate both I mean they're looking at

667
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,600
the at the temperature increases and

668
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,320
they're saying gez this is going to this

669
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,559
is going to cause real disruption in our

670
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,039
country if we have to suddenly start

671
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,200
shifting things around and people have

672
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,480
to relocate and our agricultural system

673
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,039
falls apart I mean that's bad oh and

674
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,279
people are dying during

675
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,720
heat we don't have to persuade countries

676
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:51,440
like Japan that that they need to do

677
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,360
something about climate change but their

678
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,279
their options are very constrained they

679
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,279
not only have very limited primary

680
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,120
energy resources if they decided to

681
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,840
continue to burn f fuels they don't have

682
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,960
anywhere to put the CO2 if they somehow

683
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,799
find a way to capture it and want to say

684
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,840
sequester it in the ground using a

685
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,399
technique called carbon capture and

686
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,600
sequestration which we've been

687
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:12,679
developing in in America and it's been

688
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,600
developed in other countries as well

689
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,000
they'd have to actually pay someone to

690
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,679
take their captured CO2 away to another

691
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,679
country and put it into a geological

692
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:24,480
formation that would accept it okay so

693
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,240
like on a boat okay so the these

694
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,240
countries have very very constrained

695
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,399
options and they really do need to be

696
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,720
creative to be Innovative to find new

697
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:37,480
ways to put them together you know it's

698
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,240
a painful thing in the near term but in

699
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,240
the longer term it just might turn out

700
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,520
to be a driver of innovation that makes

701
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,399
them leaders in the world's future

702
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,799
economy and we need to look out for that

703
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,440
in America I mean it it's tempting here

704
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,039
to just throw up big trade trip barriers

705
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,120
and you know keep Chinese products out

706
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,760
and raise our tariffs on them and and

707
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,320
Japanese products favor our own car

708
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,559
industry

709
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,919
last time we favored our own car

710
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,720
industry with that sort of policy we

711
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,360
ended up with really lousy expensive

712
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,799
cars and we still haven't even worked

713
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,559
our way out of that problem so we risk

714
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:12,840
cutting ourselves off from the flow of

715
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,720
global Innovation and I have to tell you

716
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,760
there's a lot going on in India as well

717
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,880
I mean this is a country with very

718
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,200
uneven primary energy resources they'

719
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,600
got a lot of coal very dirty coal some

720
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,600
people call it mud which they burn and

721
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,320
it produces not only a lot of CO2

722
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,279
because it's it burns inefficiently you

723
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,720
got to burn a lot more of it to get the

724
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:33,880
same amount of energy out but it also

725
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,600
throws out a lot of Ash and contributes

726
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,559
to a lot of the uh air pollution

727
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,080
problems they have in India they don't

728
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,480
have any natural gas so not much to

729
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,360
speak of that's all imported they've got

730
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,840
a lot of people and amazingly over the

731
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,440
last 10 years they've managed to connect

732
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,679
all of those people to the electricity

733
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,880
system when I was working in India in

734
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,039
the mid

735
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,840
2000s 60% of Indians didn't have access

736
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,480
to the grid and then it became 40 and

737
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,279
then 20 and the government got very

738
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,120
serious about it now everybody's

739
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,840
connected but the system is dominated by

740
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,880
coal generation so they've now got

741
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,600
growing demand people are getting richer

742
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,919
accustomed to using electricity for

743
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,279
stuff like air conditioning that didn't

744
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,720
used to have and they've got to deal

745
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,360
with it very urgently and so they're

746
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,279
also looking at co-firing with zero

747
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,120
carbon fuels in existing facilities but

748
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,559
they're really looking at solar and wind

749
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,120
and here you have a country that's very

750
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:33,919
motivated to to do this and a a very

751
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,799
large educated engineering Workforce a

752
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,559
very large lowcost labor force and

753
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:43,120
they're finding ways to to do solar

754
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,480
projects and onshore at least wind

755
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,200
projects that are much less expensive

756
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,799
than than we know how to do that's

757
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,799
really interesting and so they can begin

758
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,960
to do things at a scale that we're on

759
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,760
accustom to seeing really interesting to

760
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,720
think about that then spilling over into

761
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,440
their manufacturing industry and

762
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,960
suddenly we got a country with a growing

763
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,960
manufacturing base that's got a clean

764
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,840
energy system and they're exporting

765
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,600
actually there was a this line that you

766
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,760
said just a couple months ago that

767
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,760
really caught me and I have to go back

768
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,480
to it I think you said something like

769
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,120
the US risks cutting itself off from

770
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,159
like Global Innovation or something here

771
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,279
we are 2024 we've had a democrat in the

772
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,159
white house for three years in general

773
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,320
Democrats are a lot

774
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,799
more like care a lot more about climate

775
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,880
change or even talk a lot more about Dem

776
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,320
demat some Democrats so I mean really

777
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,559
like we risk cutting ourselves off when

778
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,799
you start trying to subsidize things I

779
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,360
mean trying to do even the right thing

780
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,600
yeah or throw up trade barriers you're

781
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,799
distorting the economy you're making it

782
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,120
possible to do something that didn't

783
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,919
used to be possible okay fine but but

784
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,720
that does carry risks because you're

785
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,399
also reducing the competitiveness of the

786
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,440
companies that begin doing those things

787
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:59,960
they're getting paid to do them whereas

788
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,480
companies that do the same thing or want

789
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,080
to do the same thing in in other

790
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,080
countries may not be getting paid to do

791
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,760
them so they've got to really push hard

792
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,039
on Innovation and finding ways to get

793
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,200
the cost down what tends to happen is

794
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:14,120
the rate of innovation can be faster in

795
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,799
those countries and and you know at the

796
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,760
end of the day you're you can't

797
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:19,679
subsidize Forever at a high rate or the

798
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,840
subsidies are simply overwhelmed by the

799
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,600
cost advantage that obtains elsewhere

800
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,760
you you you end up with lousy stuff that

801
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,679
cost more you mentioned um the auto

802
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,960
sector do you feel like we have too much

803
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,080
prot ISM in the auto sector we have I

804
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,440
think we we got over that but my point

805
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,840
was that it just takes a long time to

806
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,000
catch up once you you know fall behind

807
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,279
but we're still not getting those like

808
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,880
Chinese I mean like Europe has these

809
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,440
electric cars from China byd byd and I

810
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,799
mean I think these things are like

811
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,559
$112,000 for like pretty pretty nice

812
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:52,760
SUVs they're all electric I mean you

813
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,919
just you could not walk in to any auto

814
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,440
dealership and get anything close to

815
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:00,120
that price for anything close to that

816
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,919
sort of of right quality now you got to

817
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,000
of course ship those cars over here on a

818
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,039
ship and that that adds costs and um but

819
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,760
but right we could we can manage to make

820
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,320
those cars very expensive here to make

821
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,840
room for our car industry to to develop

822
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,120
and Thrive and that's fine for a while

823
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,440
but after a while you're supporting if

824
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,960
sort of a not very healthy not very

825
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,279
Innovative car industry if you aren't

826
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,919
careful my point is not that we

827
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,519
shouldn't have these subsidies we we've

828
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,639
got to somehow jump start this kind of

829
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,639
activity but it does create these sorts

830
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:32,279
of risk risks let's just talk about in

831
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,440
some ways we're talking about the future

832
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,320
but part of that future is what's

833
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,399
already baked in in terms of climate

834
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,240
change and I know one thing that we'll

835
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,840
talk about on future episodes in

836
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,760
addition to like all this green

837
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,039
technology and you know we talked about

838
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,120
solar panels wind how can we you know

839
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,760
batteries that are better there's like

840
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,760
this also this whole other category

841
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,559
right of okay well things are getting

842
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,639
hotter how do you live with that you

843
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,600
know whether it's sea is rising or

844
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,880
whatever I just wonder what you how you

845
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,639
think about that because that seems like

846
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:10,159
a pretty real problem even if like

847
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:12,080
tomorrow we really were able to

848
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,679
accomplish whole lot yeah well these two

849
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,399
things are going on at the same time one

850
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,840
is what is sort of mitigating the risks

851
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,360
as best we can by developing low carbon

852
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,039
technologies that will deliver less CO2

853
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,600
and other greenhouse gases to the

854
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,639
atmosphere in the near

855
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,159
term but you know temperature is rising

856
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:34,360
and it will continue to rise even if we

857
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:36,399
stop emitting CO2 tomorrow because this

858
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,960
this sort of momentum in the atmosphere

859
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,840
and in the climate but that will give us

860
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,880
more time and and it's it's more time to

861
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,039
adapt and so there's this other Force

862
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,200
called adaptation that we need to be

863
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,559
thinking about increasingly now

864
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,799
Technologies like temperature resistant

865
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,080
or drout resistant crops the ability to

866
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,760
engineer waterways so that we can

867
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,880
re-root water and try to protect our

868
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,039
coasts dkes Coastal reinforcements I

869
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,320
mean I hear people talking about seaw

870
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,279
wall sometimes like you have to choose

871
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,960
what parts of New York or Boston or

872
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,519
Shanghai or whatever that you need to

873
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,080
protect and yeah yeah we see that we

874
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,720
kind you know and if if sea level rises

875
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,200
by a meter or two in a year we couldn't

876
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,960
possibly build those dkes fast enough to

877
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,480
to preserve our environment if it takes

878
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,519
50 years we got a shot and so reducing

879
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,039
emissions now well it might seem sort of

880
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,000
hopeless is really really important

881
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,200
because it stretches that timeline and

882
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,799
it's all about balancing mitigation and

883
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,720
adaptation I guess a final question

884
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,399
about money I know there are Venture

885
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,960
capitalists out there who are pouring

886
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,279
money into green technologies obviously

887
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,159
the government has done this with

888
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,799
varying levels of success I remember

889
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,080
times you're in the Obama Administration

890
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,399
where people are like look this went

891
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,360
wrong and you know but sometimes it

892
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,240
really has been successful

893
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,080
universities are working on stuff is

894
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,600
there a huge deficit of money is there

895
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,159
plenty of money but not enough good

896
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,760
stuff to throw it at like give me a

897
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,159
sense of what the money situation looks

898
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,520
like well we've gone through a couple of

899
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,440
waves of venture capital in renewable

900
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,280
energy the the first one was in the sort

901
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,079
of mid 2000s through 2010 12 or so on

902
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,119
and a lot of money was thrown at

903
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,560
Technologies for which there was no

904
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,040
demand or very little demand and the

905
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,879
result was that a lot of those

906
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,320
Investments were kind of disappointing

907
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,359
and and that created a low but we're

908
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,679
back into a period in which there is a

909
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,919
lot of investment and there are a lot of

910
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,639
really good ideas emerging and demand is

911
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,280
also emerging for those Technologies as

912
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,040
we we know we get more sun and wind on

913
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,320
the grid we got more demand for storage

914
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,240
all of a sudden as the government begins

915
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,720
to subsidize hydrogen production as they

916
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,200
have through the

917
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,920
IRA the inflation reduction act suddenly

918
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,520
there's a lot more demand for high

919
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,880
quality efficient electrolyzers the

920
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,680
devices that use electricity to convert

921
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,000
water into hydrogen and

922
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,160
oxygen so we're going to this other this

923
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,160
new I think very important wave there's

924
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,880
a lot of chaff there's so many

925
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,680
inventions coming at us that sometimes

926
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,160
it's hard to know which ones are are

927
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,920
worth funding and you know may the

928
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,079
smartest venture capitalist

929
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,400
win in that battle but a lot of money

930
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,760
will get was isn't that always how it

931
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,079
works no it isn't okay I mean the the

932
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,119
the risk return ratio is high uh in

933
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,520
these things but there really are some

934
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,720
great ideas and and they should give us

935
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,599
all hope and we're going to talk about

936
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,720
these course of the next many episodes I

937
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,520
think one of the most exciting ones is

938
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,320
Fusion magnetic Fusion sometimes called

939
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,839
nuclear fusion but it is a different

940
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,040
nuclear technology from the one we're

941
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,560
all familiar with that that uses uranium

942
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,680
to generate electricity and also

943
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,440
produces a lot of uranium waste in the

944
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,200
process that we're not really good about

945
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,359
dealing with my opinion this is the kind

946
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,720
of waste that they put in like yucka

947
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,400
mountain and Nevada yeah well they don't

948
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,800
put in yucka Mountain the problem they

949
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,040
don't put it they've discussed putting

950
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,800
it in the mountain and probably

951
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,000
neighbors are like we don't really want

952
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,000
to be near yucka Mountain in law is our

953
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,839
national repository but we don't put

954
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,599
stuff there okay because there's

955
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,680
resistance in Nevada to using it for

956
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,520
those purposes there's concern about

957
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,319
transporting nuclear waste along

958
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,240
railroads and so what we do is we leave

959
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:32,240
it in the parking lots of nuclear power

960
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,119
plants or in the cooling pools above

961
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,880
nuclear reactors in those power plants

962
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,520
Without Really the near-term intention

963
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,400
at least to move it away it's not unsafe

964
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,560
but it doesn't look very tidy and it's

965
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,839
not doesn't make a convincing

966
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,800
demonstration that we're kind of on it

967
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:50,440
okay um and and I think that probably

968
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,760
contributes to public resistance to

969
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,920
Conventional nuclear power we got to

970
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,640
have conventional nuclear power and and

971
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,280
there's a lot of work that's that's

972
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,440
going on in s but but in companies as

973
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,000
well that will enable us to have very

974
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,680
Advanced nuclear reactors that really

975
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,200
are very very safe

976
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,599
operationally we've got to build them

977
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,520
small modular reactors that maybe can be

978
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,880
built in a factory environment in a in a

979
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,920
much more repeatable way and as a result

980
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,119
maybe a little bit less expensively are

981
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,480
also emerging and they're being

982
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,720
subsidized by the government push

983
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,160
forward as fast as they can the

984
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,560
Canadians are making you know real

985
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,480
strides but we've got to figure out that

986
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,040
waste problem U the the fins have built

987
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,200
a repository of a kind that's been

988
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,160
suggested for the United States by

989
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,839
Americans it's called midterm Storage

990
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,480
storage that will be very safe

991
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,119
geologically for periods of centuries

992
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,839
it's not long enough we need maybe

993
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,920
thousands of years but long enough for

994
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,119
us to put it out of Harm's Way and think

995
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,520
about what those multi- thousand year

996
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,079
Solutions might be so that's great and

997
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,240
it's moving and I hope we transition

998
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,400
onto that track here but at the same

999
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,920
time magnetic fusion and and other forms

1000
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:08,680
of fusion not fision which combine light

1001
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,280
nuclei together to release energy okay

1002
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,160
are advancing rapidly um this is

1003
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,640
technology that people began working on

1004
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,960
in the 50s in in the UK and in the US

1005
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,400
and in Russia I think I heard somebody

1006
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,400
joke that this was the kind of

1007
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,040
technology that was always 30 years away

1008
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,800
50 50 whatever you know it was like

1009
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,720
every time you asked it was didn't get

1010
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,000
any closer but it seems like now it

1011
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,680
really is getting closer like here in

1012
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,160
Massachusetts Commonwealth Fusion

1013
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,160
systems has taken over an old military

1014
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,280
base right yeah leveled it and created a

1015
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,680
a a new reactor we are building what I

1016
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,920
think will be the world's first

1017
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,720
functioning magnetic Fusion reactor and

1018
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,119
like when do you imagine that it maybe

1019
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,760
would come into use well it will be a

1020
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,119
demonstration initially um and my

1021
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,160
understanding is that within something

1022
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,319
like two years they will have a

1023
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,000
functioning unit sitting there that will

1024
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:04,680
be producing more energy than it

1025
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,720
consumes from the electric grid that

1026
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,760
ratio is called the Q so the amount out

1027
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,680
divided by the amount in we've never

1028
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,599
crossed a q of one in the world in

1029
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,760
Fusion yet they're aiming to be able to

1030
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,200
operate at cues of between 10 and 20 in

1031
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,520
the future and that that's all about

1032
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,079
making these plants work very

1033
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,359
efficiently learning how to control the

1034
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,839
systems that make them work these Fusion

1035
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,240
reactors have two major systems one is

1036
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,000
is a superconducting magnet system

1037
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,440
that's used to confine the plasma of

1038
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,280
burning dyum and tritium and the other

1039
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,400
one is a cryogenic system that's used to

1040
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,119
keep that magnet cold they're both very

1041
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,800
expensive systems and and together they

1042
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,960
constitute the majority of the cost of

1043
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,760
the fusion reactor and these things all

1044
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,720
have to be put together along with the

1045
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,760
containment system that captures the

1046
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,839
energetic neutrons released by that

1047
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,760
reaction and then the energy has to be

1048
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,640
transferred somehow through a a series

1049
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,680
of heat exchangers into a power plant

1050
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,200
that will produce electricity that's all

1051
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,480
going to take a lot of time and and the

1052
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,880
materials problems associated with those

1053
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,000
subsystems are very complex and they in

1054
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,680
some measure will gate how quickly we

1055
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,040
can bring those systems to bear in

1056
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,280
practice we're at the point now where we

1057
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,720
have demonstrated the magnets we need

1058
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,880
and this is a breakthrough that occurred

1059
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,800
at MIT using high temperature

1060
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,040
superconductors for the first time to

1061
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,400
produce magnets of the size and strength

1062
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,200
that are required for that confinement

1063
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,160
and that's what triggered the massive

1064
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,200
investment that the fusion industry has

1065
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,720
received but Commonwealth Fusion systems

1066
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,560
in particular has benefited from that's

1067
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,240
enabled them to go forward as though

1068
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,560
this is a venture fundable business

1069
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,000
which is where we started in this

1070
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,640
discussion so this is a startup of sort

1071
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,480
of Epic scale and is it a game Cher do

1072
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,160
you think in terms of like creating

1073
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,160
energy in the US or around the world KY

1074
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,280
this is the thing that could change

1075
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,280
everything if if we can really make

1076
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,560
fusion work we think we can make it work

1077
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,240
affordably and and if we can make it

1078
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,160
work safely we think we can make it work

1079
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,920
safely it's inherently much much safer

1080
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,720
than

1081
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,040
fision then this could be the technology

1082
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,079
that enables us to really decarbonize

1083
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,920
the whole world it it won't happen the

1084
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,599
day after we get that reactor working in

1085
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,040
two years we have a reactor that

1086
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,359
actually generates electricity this one

1087
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,520
will only generate heat but a reactor

1088
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,480
that generates electricity within about

1089
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,839
5 years after that and we'll meter it

1090
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,520
out onto the grid that will be another

1091
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:29,200
sort of experiment prototype but then

1092
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,359
they'll they'll begin developing

1093
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,720
commercial reactors that will be sold

1094
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,720
kind of in the middle of the next decade

1095
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,119
end of the next decade and those things

1096
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,760
could go to scale by the middle of the

1097
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,720
century I I guess it speaks to something

1098
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,640
we were talking about at the very

1099
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,520
beginning which is like putting a lot of

1100
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,079
bets out there because you don't

1101
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,880
actually know when you said like this

1102
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:52,520
could be a game changer but we don't

1103
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,079
know and could really be amazing but

1104
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,359
there's stuff that's sort of to be

1105
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,079
determined still about it and there's

1106
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:00,079
probably a bunch of

1107
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,599
really really good bets out there maybe

1108
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,839
some not so good bets but you have to

1109
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,160
kind of go in and start placing them

1110
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,960
right yeah exactly and and you know God

1111
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,520
Bless The Venture Capital Community and

1112
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,920
a lot of established companies that

1113
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,240
really see themselves having to

1114
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,760
transition into these new systems new

1115
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,359
forms of energy uh in order to to

1116
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,319
transition their businesses God bless

1117
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,880
them for investing the the billions

1118
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:26,640
that're investing in in these

1119
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,040
Technologies Fusion alone as a as a

1120
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,200
class of Technologies has attracted over

1121
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,520
$6 billion doll worth of investment in

1122
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,880
the last few years globally um two

1123
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,880
billion of that has gone to Commonwealth

1124
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,400
Fusion systems but there are 40 some

1125
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,319
maybe 45 other Fusion companies in the

1126
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,680
world 25 of them in the United States

1127
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:49,800
trying to do Fusion in similar ways or

1128
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,160
in some cases very different ways uh and

1129
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,440
it's created a tremendous amount of

1130
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,319
excitement and believe it or not we now

1131
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,280
have not we don't just have Fusion 50

1132
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:00,319
years in the future the way we did we

1133
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,800
have a competition to be there first so

1134
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,400
I I mean sort of looking ahead for us

1135
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,920
we're going to talk Fusion we're going

1136
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,000
to talk wind we're going to talk solar

1137
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,280
we're going to talk a whole bunch of

1138
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,440
different Technologies batteries

1139
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,880
obviously but I think we're also one of

1140
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,880
the things I want to dive into a little

1141
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,880
bit is the economics of this I mean sort

1142
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,160
of looking at all these things like how

1143
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,359
do we get from here to there and what

1144
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,119
technologies are going to take us there

1145
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,800
um what economic approaches are going to

1146
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,040
take us there or are holding us back and

1147
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,079
we kind kind of talked about the carbon

1148
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,160
tax and everything I mean I think that's

1149
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,400
our goal right is to think how do you

1150
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,640
get there and like start breaking that

1151
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,280
down for people in a way that they can

1152
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,119
understand what if it works yeah exactly

1153
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,400
there we are so we have all of these

1154
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,720
Technologies and they're advancing and

1155
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,119
they're advancing at different speeds

1156
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,839
and different places we have gaps we

1157
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,520
have to figure out how to do stuff with

1158
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,400
electricity that we don't currently do

1159
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,599
with electricity a lot of industrial

1160
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,200
processes a lot of Transportation

1161
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,960
processes you ever see an electric air

1162
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,000
plane you ever seen electric jet uh no

1163
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,559
but there's starting to be electric

1164
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,319
Freighters out there on the oceans

1165
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,000
there're starting to be methanol powered

1166
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,400
freighter out there on the oceans maybe

1167
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,480
there'll be ammonia powered freighter

1168
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,880
out there on the oceans stuff is

1169
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,440
advancing we have to figure out how to

1170
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,040
put it together and make the new economy

1171
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,440
work with all of these different

1172
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,119
ingredients we have to train people and

1173
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,720
that that unfortunately is a is a

1174
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:27,760
generational problem and that's again an

1175
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,200
aspect of

1176
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,520
dealing with it right uh and still being

1177
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,160
optimistic one of my sort of rules of

1178
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,800
thumb is that to replace the energy

1179
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,520
infrastructure of a country costs about

1180
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,559
a GDP of that country like a whole year

1181
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:48,440
of them earning money and all the stuff

1182
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:50,559
like the value of all that everything

1183
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,920
goes into it for year obviously you

1184
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,040
can't do that people can't eat they can

1185
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,040
nothing else happens so how fast can you

1186
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,599
do it well we currently spend something

1187
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:04,319
something like a couple of percent of

1188
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:07,520
GDP on energy infrastructure okay so

1189
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:10,880
that would be 100% divided by 2% a year

1190
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,280
so that's 50 years and that's kind of

1191
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,760
the natural rate of turnover okay of the

1192
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,680
energy systems infrastructure and that

1193
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,520
that lesson is pretty much true

1194
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,359
everywhere 50 years is too long I was

1195
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,359
getting one you thought that was a

1196
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:26,400
little too slow yeah one year is way too

1197
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,960
short though so the right answer is

1198
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:34,440
somewhere in the middle so how far can

1199
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,440
we push our economy to make stuff happen

1200
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:42,000
sooner is the answer 20 years maybe it

1201
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:44,480
is for the United States is it 50 years

1202
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,480
maybe it is for India what is it for

1203
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,359
China I don't know it's getting to be

1204
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,200
rich a lot of a lot of industrial

1205
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:52,920
capacity there a lot of motivation to

1206
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:56,040
move quickly we don't know we need to

1207
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,480
stretch it and we need to adapt well I

1208
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,040
look forward to continue this

1209
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,760
conversation to keep asking those

1210
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,359
questions and just to ask what if it

1211
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,960
works and we'll we'll look at all the

1212
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,480
things that are currently working and

1213
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,400
and may work in the future it's going to

1214
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,400
be fun I'm looking forward to

1215
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,720
it what if it works is a production of

1216
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,559
