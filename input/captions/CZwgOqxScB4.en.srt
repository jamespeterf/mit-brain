1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,199
all right uh okay let's get started um

2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,400
so um today we're going to continue our

3
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,199
discussion of factor markets but really

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,240
we're going to focus on today is

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,640
essentially taking the insights for

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,439
Capital markets and thinking about how

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,079
in individuals and firms make decisions

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,760
over time last time we talked about the

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,840
interest rate and its role in

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,800
equilibrating capital markets we talked

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,320
about the demand for Capital being

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,200
driven by the margin Revenue product of

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,879
capital but then the more interesting

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,760
side was the supply of capital being

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,480
driven by individual decisions on how

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,239
much to save that savings went into

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,280
either the bank or to corporate bonds or

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,680
stocks and that's the money that firms

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
borrow to make

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,359
investments I wanted this lecture is

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
basically going to dive into that and

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,400
think about in the real world how do we

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,119
think about these savings and investment

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,119
decisions decisions that will be so

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,920
important to you as individuals and

26
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,280
maybe someday to you as business owners

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,400
or Executives I want to start by

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,040
discussing the key concept of present

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,119
value one of the most important Concepts

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,040
in both economics and finance is the

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,960
concept of present

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,360
value the basic idea of present value is

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,759
quite simple which is that a dollar in

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,320
the future is worth less than a dollar

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,560
now and the reason dollars in the future

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,600
is worth less than a dollar now is

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,680
because you had that dollar now you

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,680
could save it and make

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,600
interest so delaying getting money till

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,159
the future as an opportunity cost you've

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,280
missed the opportunity to earn interest

42
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,200
on that money

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,119
today so essentially the idea is you

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,280
can't just add up money that comes in

45
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,479
different periods you can't say if I

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,039
have a dollar to day and a dollar and

47
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,640
five years in 10 years that's $3 you

48
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,320
can't make that statement those are not

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,840
the same thing that' be like saying I

50
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,840
have a pound of gold and a pound of

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,640
apples and a pound of butter so I have

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,080
three pounds you wouldn't say that you'd

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,920
say well those are worth very different

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,519
things I can't just add them up and put

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,239
them in one unit which is

56
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,480
pounds likewise you can't just add up

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
dollars today and dollars in the future

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,239
and put them one group and just say

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,000
their dollars you need to actually think

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,280
about how to put these into common

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,959
values so with apples and gold and

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,440
butter we might use

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
dollars okay with money in different

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,120
periods we're going to use the the

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
concept of present value essentially

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,239
what we're going to do is we're going to

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,480
take take all future dollar flows and

68
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,400
translate them into today's terms the

69
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,560
present value of a dollar at any point

70
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,840
in time is what it's worth in the

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,360
present what it's worth

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,159
today okay so suppose for example that

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,159
the interest rate is

74
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:13,280
10% okay and you start and that you want

75
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:16,640
to have $100 next year you would like to

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,920
have $100 next year well so in other

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,000
words you know that if you put some

78
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,080
amount Y into the

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,319
bank at the end of the year what we have

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,720
you have y times 1 plus I that's how

81
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,879
much you'll have at the end of the year

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,040
you'll get your money back plus the

83
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,000
interest and you want that to equal

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,400
100 that's the equation you want to

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,120
solve if you want have $100 at the end

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,560
of next year that means that

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
y equals

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,319
90.9 that's messy

89
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,239
90.9 is why that's the amount you have

90
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,840
to put in the bank today to have

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,439
$100 in one

92
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,239
year inverting that that means that more

93
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:06,239
generally the present

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,319
value of any amount of money is its

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,439
future

96
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:15,000
value over one plus the interest rate to

97
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,440
the T where T is how many periods in the

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,440
future you get the money so if you get

99
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,280
the money in one year the present value

100
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,400
of a dollar a dollar in one year is one

101
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,800
over one plus the interest rate a dollar

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,600
in two years is one over one plus the

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,479
interest rate squared

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,440
and so on essentially this is a set of

105
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,680
Weights that allows you to Value dollars

106
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,840
in all periods in today's terms by

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,880
putting them in present

108
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,320
value okay so suppose for example you

109
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,520
come to me and say look uh John I want

110
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,199
to borrow $30 I'm going to pay you back

111
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,919
$10 each of the next three years let's

112
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,320
say the interest rate is

113
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,199
10% I would say to you well that's a bad

114
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,520
deal for me

115
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,400
because what's the value of the stream

116
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,639
of payments you're going to give me

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,479
you're going to give me $10 you're going

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,280
to give me

119
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,919
$10 uh next year okay you're gonna give

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,320
me $10 next year so that's worth 10 over

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,560
1.1 to

122
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,440
me because if I had it today I could

123
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,240
have already it would have been $11 next

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,680
year you give me $10 in two years well

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,840
that's worth 10 over 1.1 squared and

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,800
you're give me $10 in three years well

127
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,479
that's worth 10 over

128
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,160
1.1 cubed

129
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,600
so in other words the $10 you give me to

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,960
the next three years is only worth $

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,360
24.87 I can't just add it up and say

132
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
we're gonna give me $30 so I'll give you

133
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,919
$30 today it's not the same thing

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
because if you give it to me today it's

135
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,680
worth more than if you give it to me in

136
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,280
the future likewise you it to me in the

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,280
future it's worth less than if you give

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,319
it to me today and the reason is simply

139
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,560
that I can

140
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,600
translate a given amount of dollars

141
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
today into more dollars in the future

142
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,880
through savings since I can do that

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,080
since I can translate that money is

144
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,919
worth less in the

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,919
future okay so more generally if we

146
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,520
write a formula for the present value of

147
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,599
any stream of payments any stream of

148
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,319
payments okay it's going to be how much

149
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,720
you're G to pay let's imagine P any

150
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,400
fixed stream of payments let's call that

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,319
F let's call F the amount you're going

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,199
to pay back with $10 in our

153
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:30,120
example

154
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:35,280
times f * 1 over 1 + I to the 1st

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:39,440
+ 1 over 1 + I to the 2 plus dot dot dot

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,479
dot dot all the way to 1 over 1 + I to

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
the

158
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,840
T where T is the last pair you're going

159
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,400
to pay me

160
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,560
back okay so you pay back over 10 years

161
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,919
there's 10 terms in this equation one

162
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,759
over 1.1 1 over 1.1 squar all the way to

163
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,319
1 over 1.1 to the

164
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,000
10th okay that is the equation for the

165
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,160
present value of a stream of payment

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,440
that's a very messy equation to evaluate

167
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,479
once the number of periods gets large

168
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
and that's why we typically use a

169
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,120
shortcut which is we you we consider the

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,599
case of a

171
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,520
perpetuity a payment a fixed payment

172
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,280
you'll get

173
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,599
forever if you do an infinite sum of

174
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,400
that

175
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,840
equation some of you will know that that

176
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,759
will yield you that the present value of

177
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,879
f forever is simply F over

178
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,720
I that's the infinite sum of that

179
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,280
equation so those $10 forever and a 10%

180
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,280
interest rate is worth

181
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,560
$100 okay it's the value of the payment

182
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
over the interest rate I'm earning and

183
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,039
that's a convenient formula now stuff

184
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,960
never goes on forever but if you think

185
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,280
about t getting

186
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,879
large then you could converge to using

187
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,319
that formula as a

188
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,759
shortcut so we'll typically the examples

189
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,840
in this class with small numbers of

190
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
periods or incredibly large numbers of

191
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,879
periods to allow you to use that

192
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,319
shortcut because having you evaluate

193
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,120
this for 12 terms just a pain in the ass

194
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,159
okay so that's sort of a shortcut we can

195
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,120
use as the number of periods gets

196
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:15,240
large okay questions about

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
that now you might also want to know

198
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,159
about the you might want to invert it

199
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,360
and say you might want to know about the

200
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,039
future value of a g stream of payments

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,520
you might say look what happens if I

202
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,199
save $10 every year what am I going to

203
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,919
have in the future so for example

204
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,120
um if I save $10 this year next year

205
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,880
I'll have $11 I'm always assuming it's

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,959
trates 10% for

207
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,680
now but then let's say I save that I

208
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,440
leave that in the bank well I have the

209
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,440
next year well the next year I'll have

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,680
1210 why will the increment from 0er to

211
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,240
one be smaller than Inc from one to

212
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,160
two why it be smaller because I've not

213
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,079
only saved the do $10 I've saved the

214
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,440
extra extra dollar and that extra dollar

215
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,880
self earns

216
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,000
interest and indeed at the end of T

217
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,720
years you will have that the future

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,839
value of a stream of savings is y times

219
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:22,480
1 + I to the T if you save for two

220
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:25,240
years and this illustrates the beauty of

221
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,040
compounding the beauty of compounding is

222
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,839
that when you put money in a savings

223
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,399
account and let it sit you're not earn

224
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,839
interest on what you initially put in

225
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,480
you earn interest on the

226
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
interest and over time that actually

227
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,200
becomes the larger part of what you save

228
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,399
over time the big issue is not what you

229
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
put in the issue is all the interest

230
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
you're earning the interest you're

231
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,440
earning on that

232
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,800
interest okay so basically let's to sort

233
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,600
of work that out let's consider an

234
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,200
example let's consider you're making a

235
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,040
retirement savings decision you might

236
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,120
think retirement gez I'm not even a

237
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,680
college yet like take it easy old man

238
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
I'm I'll worry about that in the future

239
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,560
well actually I'm going to tell you why

240
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,040
I shouldn't worry about in the future

241
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
why you should worry about it now now

242
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm going to illustrate that with a

243
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,480
simple example okay imagine you plan to

244
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,600
work from age 22 to age

245
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,800
70 okay imagine that's not a crazy guess

246
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,440
for your working life you work from 22

247
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
to

248
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,640
70 okay and let's say the interest rate

249
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,880
is 7 so you're going to

250
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,120
work 22 to

251
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,120
70 and let's say the interest rate is

252
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,519
7% okay that's our

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,240
assumptions and I'm going to give you

254
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,600
two choices for retirement savings plan

255
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm gonna give you two options option

256
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,480
one for retirement savings plan is

257
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,399
you're GNA save

258
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,000
$3,000 every year right away You're

259
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,839
gonna start saving $33,000 every year

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,279
for 15 years and then you're never going

261
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,279
to save again so age 22 to 37 you're

262
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,680
going to save

263
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:01,720
$15 you say $3,000 a year and then never

264
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:05,120
save again so it's 3 ,000 a

265
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:09,079
year for 15

266
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,440
years for 15 years okay well what will

267
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,360
you have

268
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:20,440
well after the first 15 years of doing

269
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:23,440
this by our formula you will have 75

270
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,200
387 you won't have $5,000 you might be

271
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
tempted to multiply 3,000 by 15 say well

272
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,240
15 years 45,000 that's wrong because you

273
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,800
misc compound it

274
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,040
you miss the fact that all the savings

275
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,279
is also getting interest on it thing you

276
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
already have much more than just

277
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,519
multiplying those two but that's not all

278
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,279
you then let that sit there till you

279
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:49,079
retire so you let this money sit

280
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:54,600
there okay for the next 33 years after

281
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:57,959
33 years this turns into 75 387 time

282
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,959
1.07 to the

283
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,160
33 okay okay so by the time you retire

284
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,160
you have $773,000

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,399
by Saving 3,000 a year for 15 years by

286
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,279
the time you retire you have over

287
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,880
$700,000 Let's do an alternative savings

288
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,880
plan what most people do which is hell

289
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,959
I'm Not Gon to save your time when I'm

290
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,440
22 that's nuts let's say we do instead

291
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,920
is you don't save anything until you're

292
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,920
37 you don't save anything for the first

293
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:35,519
15 years and then start to save then you

294
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,720
start to save $3,000 a year save so zero

295
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,839
for

296
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,760
15 and then

297
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:45,000
3K

298
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,519
433 if you file that Savings Plan by the

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,680
time you retire you are going to

300
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,680
have

301
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,680
$356,400

302
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,040
you're going to have half of what you

303
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,040
had with the first plan

304
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,760
why because of

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,480
compounding the way compounding works

306
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,399
the more you can get in the bank earlier

307
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,760
the more money you'll end up with

308
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,480
because you are an interest on your

309
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,560
interest how many of you have been to

310
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,760
the Science Museum here in

311
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,760
Boston okay a few of you well you

312
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,199
probably haven't been to the little kid

313
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,959
part but I have and the little kid part

314
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:24,279
in the science museum has these cool

315
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:28,079
three ramps and one ramp is flat and

316
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,399
then steep one ramp is steep and then

317
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,000
flat and one ramp sort sort of in

318
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,079
between and you have kidss put the

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,360
marbles on to see which goes faster and

320
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,639
of course the one that goes fast is the

321
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,000
one that's Steep and then flat because

322
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,120
you take advantage of the acceleration

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,199
over the flat part r one it goes flat

324
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,399
and then steep that's just

325
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,959
compounding okay compounding is simply

326
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,920
like getting their velocity up early

327
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,320
okay you're going to get there

328
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,320
faster so this is an important lesson

329
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
not just for athematics but for you for

330
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,199
thinking about your decisions you when

331
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,279
you get a job most of you going to get a

332
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,440
job in a good firm that's going to offer

333
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,040
you an option of retirement

334
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,480
plan you are going to think why should I

335
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,399
bother I'm I'm me I'm superhuman I'm

336
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
never going to

337
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,279
retire okay the answer is you're wrong

338
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,199
you are going to retire and every dollar

339
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,720
you put in now will be worth so much

340
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:20,639
when you retire that it's actually worth

341
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,199
deferring consumption now remember

342
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,519
capital is deferred

343
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,079
consumption so decision you'll face when

344
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,639
you join your firm is should I defer

345
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,079
today's

346
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,680
consumption to have for the

347
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,000
future and the answer is uh and the

348
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,759
answer is you should defer money to Da

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,199
consumption for the future moreover it's

350
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,600
even better than that because most of

351
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:46,920
you will work for firms which offer a

352
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,399
retirement plan called the

353
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:53,800
401K which is tax preferred what that

354
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:57,680
means is if they if you take the money

355
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,959
home today you pay tax on it if you put

356
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,199
in your 401k you you don't pay tax on it

357
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,040
till you

358
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,000
retire now why do you care if you're

359
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,680
going to pay tax anyway why do you care

360
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,320
if you pay tax today versus paying tax

361
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,199
when you're retire well the answer is

362
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,040
just like a dollar in the future is

363
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,399
worth less than a dollar today paying

364
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,959
taxes in the future is effectively

365
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,040
cheaper than paying taxes today because

366
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,000
you're paying taxes with the future

367
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,839
dollars that are worth less than today's

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,040
dollars so by deferring your taxes just

369
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,279
like I don't want to defer my getting

370
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,040
repayment from you by deferring your

371
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,360
taxes you save money it's even better

372
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,199
than that because most employers will

373
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,319
match what you save in your retirement

374
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,759
plan so when you go to a firm and you

375
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,959
start a new job many employers will say

376
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,920
well the first $3,000 will match you

377
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,680
dollar for dooll this is an unbelievably

378
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,279
good deal you're going to get the

379
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,720
compounding and for the next 50 plus

380
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,680
years you're going to get a tax break

381
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,920
and your employer going to help you

382
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,399
out so you should

383
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,120
absolutely save as much as you possibly

384
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:04,079
can as early as you possibly can for

385
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,040
retirement okay because of the beauty of

386
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,079
compounding let's think of a real world

387
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,720
example how many of you heard of Bobby

388
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,319
Bonia anybody here Bob Bonia I got I got

389
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,480
a couple head I got a few head noots

390
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:20,240
three four okay Bobby Bonia was a good

391
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,639
good but not great well I at at Peak

392
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,279
great but mostly good baseball player um

393
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,759
he played for the Mets at the end of his

394
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,279
career but by the end of his career his

395
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,440
his Talent wasn't worth the salary

396
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,240
they're playing him he sort of fell off

397
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,600
a cliff pretty quickly and it wasn't

398
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,639
worth the money they were paying him so

399
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,120
they offered to buy him out they said in

400
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,279
1999 we'll give you six million bucks to

401
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,680
just bag your contract and leave you w't

402
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,720
have to play baseball anymore can retire

403
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,160
pay $6 million out the

404
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,360
door he said you know that's a great

405
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,199
idea I'm happy to do it but I don't

406
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,399
really need the money right now how

407
00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:00,199
about if we Chang the deal how about if

408
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,839
we said we defer the money from 1999 at

409
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:07,000
an 8% interest rate and instead I'll

410
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,880
collect it over the 2011 to 2035 period

411
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,799
so deferred for 20 years at an interest

412
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,280
rate and then collect it over a time

413
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,439
period the way that worked out for him

414
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,679
is that by the time his money started

415
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,079
being paid out in 2011 his $6 Million

416
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,799
worth $30

417
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,559
million so he basically gets a million

418
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:28,160
dollars a year till he's 72 years old

419
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,640
indeed there's Bobby Bia day which is

420
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,320
the day the Mets pay Bobby b a million

421
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,880
dollars okay um so basically this is a

422
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,679
guy who understood compounding

423
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,000
understood the value deferring and now

424
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,960
he gets a million bucks year to 72

425
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,280
instead of just getting $6 million at

426
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,320
once back when he was young and didn't

427
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,799
need as

428
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,919
much okay so this is the value of

429
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,880
deferring the value of compounding which

430
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:58,000
says save early and save

431
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,000
often okay questions about that yeah

432
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,640
this one oh I simply use this

433
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:12,360
formula I mean me simply it someone did

434
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,360
you know I did in a spreadsheet but

435
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,360
yeah well that's a great question

436
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,080
basically it's sort of approximately

437
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,600
Infinity we will let you know in a

438
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,480
problem whether you can use that

439
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,360
shortcut or not but roughly speaking

440
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,200
we're not going to give you a problem we

441
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,440
have to calculate over 10 periods we

442
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,760
give you a short number of periods we'll

443
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,600
give you a huge number of periods which

444
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,360
is effectively infinite but we'll let

445
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,200
you

446
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,159
know

447
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,360
okay technically in the real world not

448
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,679
an exam you have to do it this way until

449
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,919
you get to Infinity this is just an

450
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,000
approximation but in practice it's a

451
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,320
pretty good approximation once you get

452
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
out like 30 period depends on the

453
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,880
interest rate the higher the interest

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,640
rate is the fewer periods you need to go

455
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,760
out for that to be a good approximation

456
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,799
lower the interest rate is the more

457
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,720
periods you have to go out for that to

458
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,720
be a good approximation

459
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,320
okay other

460
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,320
questions all right so

461
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,320
now

462
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,280
yeah you talking about the tax piece um

463
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,720
it's but the point is with the tax the

464
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,080
point is think of it this way

465
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,840
if I pay taxes today let's say I pay a

466
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,520
dollar of taxes

467
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,720
today versus uh a dollar taxes in the

468
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,120
future okay the dollar taxes today that

469
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,120
I pay to the government they get to earn

470
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,120
interest

471
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,440
on whereas if I hold it I get to earn

472
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,280
interest on it so as long as the tax

473
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,320
rate is less than 100% I get to make the

474
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,440
why if the government holds the money

475
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,840
they make the money if I hold the money

476
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,640
I make the money better for me to make

477
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,080
the money does that make sense good

478
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,400
question other

479
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,200
questions okay now some of you may be

480
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,080
thinking this is all well and good but

481
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,440
shit's going to cost more in the future

482
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Bobby Bia making a million bucks in 2030

483
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,240
is buying much more expensive stuff than

484
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:19,600
Bobby Bia was buying in 1999 what about

485
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,240
that what about the role of inflation so

486
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,240
let's talk about

487
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,360
inflation in other words in my

488
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,919
discussion so far I assumed prices

489
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,280
didn't change but in fact prices do

490
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,720
change they go

491
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,240
up okay we typically measure that by

492
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,080
something called the Consumer Price

493
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:45,320
Index the Consumer Price Index is

494
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,520
essentially a measure of what a fixed

495
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,039
basket of goods costs over time so

496
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,120
essentially to find a basket of goods

497
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,559
that a typical person would buy and they

498
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,840
go and measure every quarter they

499
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,120
literally go to stores and say what does

500
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,960
this cost so fixed basket Goods includes

501
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,200
one men shirt okay okay let's go see

502
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,080
what the average price of a men's shirt

503
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,960
is it includes one women's shirt let's

504
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,080
see what the average price of women's

505
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,280
shirt is it includes 67% of a of a new

506
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,840
or or 12% of a new computer let's see

507
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,200
what new computer costs Etc so they

508
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,440
basically have a set of

509
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,279
Weights that are determined by a

510
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,240
consumption bundle say for that set of

511
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,679
good weights what do it cost by the same

512
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,240
set of things over time and that gives

513
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,720
you an index

514
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,480
value and that they normalize it to one

515
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,919
at the year 1982 for some arbitrary

516
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,240
reason so B basally the CPI says what

517
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,159
does stuff cost relev to what it cost in

518
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,799
1982 and you can see that in figure

519
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,440
171 figure 171 is a graph of the CPI

520
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:46,000
what you can see is basically it's

521
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,880
identically one uh 100 in

522
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,919
1982 and it's rising before and after

523
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,320
1982 you can see that the rise is

524
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:57,520
relatively rapid in the

525
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,919
1970s okay in percentage terms that was

526
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
a lot of inflation the 1970s into 1980s

527
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,640
and then it's sort of flattened out

528
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,240
inflation's been slower since so this is

529
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,799
how we measure

530
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,080
inflation

531
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,080
okay the fact there's

532
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,200
inflation means that everything I've

533
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,320
taught you is wrong in one critical

534
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,679
respect which is everything I've taught

535
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,799
you is about I the interest rate but

536
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,960
that's not what you should care

537
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,520
about you don't care about what the

538
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,360
interest rate is what the nominal

539
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,880
interest rate is you don't care about

540
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,880
how much money you have in the future

541
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,279
you care about how much how much good

542
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,320
you can consume in the future money is

543
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:35,600
just a means of exchange if I tell you

544
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,720
in 20 years you'll have $100 you don't

545
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
know what's that worth without no one

546
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,120
stuff's going to cost in 20 years what

547
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,240
you really care about is your purchasing

548
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,480
power okay you really care about is your

549
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,520
purchasing power so for example suppose

550
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,520
today I'm going to save $100 at a 10%

551
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,640
interest rate $100 at a 10% interest

552
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,679
rate what I care about is not how much

553
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,480
money I have next year but how many

554
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,039
Goods I can buy next year so let's say

555
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,480
I'm like Marsha Lynch and all I care

556
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,200
about is Skittles okay that's all I care

557
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,760
about okay and let's suppose that

558
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,760
Skittles today are $1 a

559
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:20,000
bag so my $100 take I buy 100 bags of

560
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,000
Skittles okay so I could buy a 100 bags

561
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,480
today now let's say the price of

562
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,159
Skittles does not change but I earn 10%

563
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,440
interest

564
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,320
then next year I can buy 110

565
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,520
bags next

566
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,400
year right the price of Skittles is

567
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,960
still a dollar I Sav my $100 at 10% I

568
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,440
have $110 my 110

569
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,760
bags but let's say the price of Skittles

570
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,880
has also gone up by 10% how many bags

571
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,760
can I buy next

572
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,360
year someone tell me if the price

573
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,159
Skittles gone up for a dollar1 10 yeah

574
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,919
back to 100 back to 100

575
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,480
bags so basically what I can buy is a

576
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,200
function of the interest rate and

577
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,520
prices so what I care about is not the

578
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,919
nominal interest rate but what we call

579
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,000
the real interest rate which is the

580
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,080
nominal interest rate minus

581
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,760
inflation which for some reason we

582
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,960
denote by pi even though Pi is also

583
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,799
profits I don't know why we do that

584
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,960
we're difficult

585
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,840
profession okay so the real interest

586
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,799
rate is the nominal interest rate minus

587
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,799
inflation and that's what I care about

588
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,760
that's what I can buy is not the nominal

589
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,080
interest rate but the real interest rate

590
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,720
determines what I can

591
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,840
buy now this is a big topic of

592
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,000
discussion macroeconomics in particular

593
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,679
really fascinating point about this is

594
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,080
that really this should be the expected

595
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,279
inflation rate because I don't know what

596
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,720
the inflation rates could be when I put

597
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,559
my money in the bank today I know I but

598
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,600
I don't know what the what inflation's

599
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,679
going to be I know what it's been but

600
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,520
know it's going to be so if I say it's

601
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,520
$100 worth in 20 years you have to give

602
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,440
me your expectation of

603
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,440
inflation so it's actually pretty

604
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,440
complicated and it goes back to things

605
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,399
we've talked about how people make

606
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,679
decisions and what things we will talk

607
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,760
about how people think about these

608
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,120
things like how do you form expectations

609
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,840
of inflation rate it turns out there is

610
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,919
a near perfect predictor of people's

611
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,080
inflation rate expectations which is

612
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,080
what's happened to gas prices most

613
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,320
people look at what's happened to gas

614
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,120
prices based on that they decide when

615
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,760
what inflation is going to

616
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,240
be um but the bottom line is in theory

617
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,360
it's a very sophisticated there are

618
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,320
people there are actually hundreds of

619
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,320
thousands of people whose entire job

620
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,960
mostly work in financial sectors but

621
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,600
some working for the Federal Reserve

622
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,960
whose entire job is to form good

623
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,279
expectations of this that's their whole

624
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,520
life it's to figure out how can I what's

625
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,600
inflation going to be and how does that

626
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,799
affect decisions we're going to make and

627
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,880
turns out to be a very hard and

628
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:01,120
complicated complicated

629
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,039
calculation but um so uh so that

630
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,080
determines to be very very

631
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,200
important uh in thinking about what the

632
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,440
real EST rate's going to be okay

633
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,080
questions about

634
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,279
that now I'm gonna go back and I'll

635
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,360
sometimes I use R sometimes I'll use

636
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,720
I the bottom line is what matters for

637
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,679
real decision- making is R okay does use

638
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,440
I because it's more convenient but if

639
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,960
everybody use I it means I'm assuming

640
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,559
inflation zero okay so whenever I use I

641
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm assuming inflation zero I really

642
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,159
should use r worship sometimes we slip

643
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,440
back and forth but basically really

644
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,520
should use R that's a relevant decision

645
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,159
making uh

646
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,159
tool okay questions

647
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,320
yeah awesome great question and a whole

648
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,640
field of research is what do you do

649
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,880
about

650
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,360
Innovation what do you do so here's a

651
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,240
here's a perfect example imagine that

652
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,799
there's a good that 198 in so let here's

653
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,159
here's a great example let's take the

654
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,559
laptop which in 1990 was incredibly

655
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:13,799
expensive and is now much much

656
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:17,559
cheaper okay so basically you would say

657
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,080
well basically uh we have Life Is Life

658
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,960
is cheaper now but in fact laptops do a

659
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,360
ton more how do we account for that how

660
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,080
do we we really want to think about the

661
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,120
price per unit of power not the price of

662
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,360
a laptop but the price per unit of doing

663
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,600
stuff okay that's gone down a ton more

664
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,640
the average laptop today is maybe half

665
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,480
the price average laptop in 1990 but the

666
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,159
average value of a lapt is 100 times the

667
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,919
average value of a laptop in 1990 we can

668
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,480
do so many more things with it the

669
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,519
computing power is so much

670
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,159
larger that's not reflected in the

671
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,120
typical CPI so many people think we need

672
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,880
to adjust the CPI for essentially what's

673
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,200
happening to productivity what's

674
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,080
happening not just to the goods we buy

675
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
but what we can do with them and that's

676
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,799
a very difficult and interesting

677
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,679
field the clear conclusion is the CPI is

678
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,440
too large the growth rate of prices you

679
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,080
hear every year is too large because

680
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
we're missing the underlying

681
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,080
innovations that for the same price

682
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,279
you're getting a better good you're

683
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,440
missing that and so as a result when we

684
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,720
say gee inflation went up 3% you think

685
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,399
wow it's 3% more expensive live in

686
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,840
America that's not quite true it's 3% to

687
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,120
live in more expens to live in America

688
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,880
by the same stuff but you're getting

689
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,440
better stuff and that should be

690
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:33,440
accounted for it's a good question other

691
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,440
questions

692
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,679
yeah yeah so now so now this is why all

693
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,960
Shake 1402 especially now right now in

694
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,640
the last year you've heard a lot about

695
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,519
interest rates and inflation and things

696
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,120
like that so basically I'm going to give

697
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,159
you a two-minute primer and leave the

698
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,720
rest at 1402 so two-minute primers go

699
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,399
back to last lecture think about the

700
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,519
market for

701
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,480
capital okay you've got the supply of

702
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,840
capital on the x-axis the price of

703
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,120
capital which is really we now know the

704
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,559
real interest rate on the y axis you've

705
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
got the supply of capital and the demand

706
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,840
for Capital and some equilibrium

707
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
interest rate R star and some

708
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,279
equilibrium Capital amount

709
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,799
Kar okay now where does the demand for

710
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,640
Capital come from well let's start with

711
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,960
Supply where's supply of capital come

712
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,440
from comes from people

713
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,320
savings so as the interest rate goes up

714
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,200
people save more what they do less of

715
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,440
they consume less so by raising the

716
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,880
interest rate you lower the amount of

717
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,480
demand for spending or you cool off the

718
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,679
economy likewise what do firms do as the

719
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,840
interest rate goes

720
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,399
up well they as the interest rate goes

721
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,360
up they spend less money building

722
00:29:55,399 --> 00:30:00,640
machines there's less demand for

723
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,200
investment so you cool off the economy

724
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,600
so IDE is by Rising interest rate cools

725
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,600
off the economy by lowering both the

726
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,919
demand and supply of capital okay and

727
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,559
that that's basically uh essentially why

728
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,919
the FED uses interest rate as a tool to

729
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,080
fight to fight that that is something

730
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:17,159
you'll Le a lot more and a lot richer

731
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,360
unfortunate too but that's the basic

732
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,840
deal for those of you who want to S

733
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,840
understand the news at that level

734
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,159
okay now um and obviously the tricky

735
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,480
thing is how much you raise the interest

736
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,640
rate and that depends on this

737
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,559
which is why there are hundreds of

738
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,720
people thousands of people probably

739
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,640
employed at feds around the country

740
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,960
trying to figure out what this is

741
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,600
because that determines what they should

742
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,679
do to set the right

743
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:44,519
rstar okay now let's go back to micro

744
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,360
and let's talk about choices over time

745
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:50,360
let's talk about how you make how

746
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:55,760
individuals and firms make choices over

747
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,760
time P three choices over time

748
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,159
okay

749
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,120
so we're now equipped to ask the

750
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,519
question what do you do when you face

751
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,960
decisions that have different payouts at

752
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,080
different periods of time and the answer

753
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,200
is you just pick the payout with the

754
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,919
highest present value it doesn't matter

755
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,279
when the money comes as long as you put

756
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,080
it in the same terms so for example

757
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,240
consider a professional athlete who's

758
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,639
comparing two possible contracts

759
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,639
contract a a is 1 million

760
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,559
today contract

761
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,559
B is 500k

762
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:47,960
today and 1.5

763
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,960
million in 10

764
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,120
years well despite the Bobby B fun

765
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,320
example it's not obvious which of these

766
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,240
you should

767
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,600
choose because they're paid at different

768
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,919
times you add up you say well this is 2

769
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,919
million this is 1 million should clearly

770
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,440
choose B but that's not right because

771
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,399
this is worth less because it's in the

772
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,480
future what you want to do is compare

773
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,360
the present value of these two

774
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,799
contracts well you know the present

775
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,799
value of this contract is $1 million get

776
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,919
today what's the present value of this

777
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,000
contract well the present value is going

778
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:22,600
to be

779
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,720
500,000 500k plus 1.5 million but you

780
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:30,240
get it in 10 years you have to discount

781
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,559
it you put it over 1 plus r to the

782
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,799
10th that's the

783
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:40,279
value that you'll have so for example if

784
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:45,919
the interest rate was 7% if R equals

785
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:48,639
7% then the value of this equation is um

786
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,639
1.3

787
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,240
million so at a 7% interest rate you

788
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:59,600
should choose option

789
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:02,960
b at a 14% interest rate

790
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,240
then it's worth 0.9 million so to 14

791
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,880
percentage choose option A what's going

792
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,120
on why does option b become less

793
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,679
attractive as the interest rate goes up

794
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,120
let explain the intuition to me you see

795
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,120
the math there why does option b become

796
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:20,960
yeah exactly at a 14% interest rate if I

797
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,440
had this money now I'd get a ton of

798
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,120
money 10 years from now here I'm waiting

799
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,880
10 years to get the money money's worth

800
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,559
a lot less in the future at a 14%

801
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,880
interest rate it's all about opportunity

802
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,399
cost the higher the interest rate the

803
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,200
higher the opportunity cost of getting

804
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,000
money in the future R to getting it

805
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,639
today

806
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,240
okay so the key is basically you want

807
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:44,720
money

808
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,760
upfront when there is a um you want

809
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,639
money up

810
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,440
front when you have a higher interest

811
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:54,279
rate you're happy to defer money when

812
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,720
there's a lower interest rate okay now

813
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,120
so for example let's come back to sports

814
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,880
again let's talk about Max Scherer Max a

815
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,799
picture with the Washington Nationals in

816
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:07,159
2015 he signed a 7-year $210 million

817
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,280
contract the 10th biggest contract in

818
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,960
history at the

819
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,440
time okay but it turned out the way the

820
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,119
contract was

821
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,000
signed it was a seven-year contract was

822
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,079
paid out over 14 years he only had to

823
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,119
play for seven years but they would pay

824
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,679
him instead of paying him $30 million a

825
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,320
year they're paying him $15 million for

826
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,159
14 years even though they had to play

827
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,359
for seven

828
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,800
so the present value of that contract

829
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,520
was not

830
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,320
$210 but more like $166

831
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,800
million now why' they do that well for

832
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,359
Max shs there's ego because if you look

833
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,119
at the number 210 million that was the

834
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:48,560
second highest contract ever for a

835
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,200
pitcher you look at the present value of

836
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,119
166 million it was like the fifth

837
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,599
highest contract ever for a pitcher some

838
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,000
ex couldn't go bragging you got the

839
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,920
second highest contract ever for a

840
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,160
pitcher uh uh by if if they just give

841
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,200
them 166 million so that's how it come

842
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,280
be confused or more generally let's

843
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,640
think about the

844
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,760
lottery okay you see the Mega Millions

845
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,880
is a billion dollars you think this is

846
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,359
great a billion dollars but you're not

847
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,839
getting a billion dollars what you're

848
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:16,760
getting is something like $33 million

849
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,359
over the next 30

850
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,680
Years so the present value of Mega

851
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,520
Millions is less than half of what's

852
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,480
advertized they don't hand you a billion

853
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,000
dollars today they say we're going to

854
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,800
give you 33 million over the next 30

855
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,079
Years year next 30 Years still not bad I

856
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,960
mean I take it but a lot less than you

857
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:37,520
think because it's paid out over

858
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,960
time okay so this determines the numbers

859
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,880
you hear when you hear a number from now

860
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,160
on when if a number where people make

861
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,440
the mistake of adding up numbers in the

862
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,960
future period but today you've got to

863
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,119
recognize that's wrong and you should be

864
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,200
using the present value which puts

865
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,480
everything in today's terms rather than

866
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,839
uh uh falsely adding up future dollars

867
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,119
with today's dollars

868
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:04,319
this doesn't just affect you this

869
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,319
affects firms investment

870
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,720
decisions firms investment

871
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,240
decisions okay so for

872
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,640
example firms have a particularly

873
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,920
interesting choice because firms have

874
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,000
decisions where they sort of put aside

875
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,319
money

876
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,119
today to get money in the future that's

877
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:28,079
what investment is right so what firms

878
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,640
consider

879
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,520
when they make an investment decision is

880
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,720
they consider what's the net present

881
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,520
value of that investment the npv what's

882
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,119
the Net Present Value so for example

883
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,280
consider firm the a stream of payments

884
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,160
where you're going to get revenues in

885
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,359
each period of R subt and cost of C subt

886
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,680
so you have a project where you get

887
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,720
revenues of R subt and cost of C subt in

888
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,280
every

889
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,760
period the net present value of that

890
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,520
stream of payments is equal to

891
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:09,760
r0 -

892
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:14,599
c0 plus R1 - C1 over 1 + r plus R2 minus

893
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:18,200
C2 over 1 + r 2 and so

894
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:22,880
on that's the Net Present

895
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Value this matters because cash flow is

896
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,240
typically negative in the early years of

897
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,560
an

898
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,119
investment typically investment means r0

899
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,319
is less than c0 you got to buy this big

900
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,079
machine you don't make that much money

901
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:38,960
right away but eventually you make the

902
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,880
money if you simply add it up and don't

903
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,760
discount investment will always look

904
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,280
great but if you recognize that

905
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,119
investing a lot today might yield money

906
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,520
in 20 years when it's worth less it

907
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:51,520
might not look as

908
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,720
good okay so basically imagine for

909
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,240
example you have a big upfront

910
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,240
investment of $100 in Year One

911
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,880
with no revenues so you have something

912
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,839
where in year one you get aund it's a

913
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,680
$100 cost and no revenues in year two

914
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:11,040
it's $200 in revenues and no

915
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,880
costs well you might think GE I'm sorry

916
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:19,520
you're tr get $150 in revenue and no

917
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:24,560
cost so year one c0 is 100 C1 equals 0

918
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,599
r0 equals 0 R1 equals 150 well if you

919
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,240
add these up you'll say gee this is a

920
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,960
great deal it cost 100 I make

921
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,040
150 that's a great deal but you know now

922
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:38,040
that's not the right way to think about

923
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:41,800
it okay if the interest rate is

924
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:46,880
10% then this formula at a 10% interest

925
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:50,079
rate this formula will say the npv of

926
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,079
this investment is

927
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,079
$363 that'll be the TR

928
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,240
10% but but as the interest rate goes up

929
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,760
eventually that will go

930
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,520
negative

931
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,960
why because there's an opportunity cost

932
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,560
of investing in the machine today which

933
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,480
is you could have put the money in the

934
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,880
bank firms just like people have an have

935
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,839
a decision to make about whether to

936
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,079
invest today in the future as described

937
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,560
a minute ago talking about the macro

938
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,920
stuff the higher the interest rate the

939
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,599
less attractive investment today is why

940
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,920
because they could put it in the bank

941
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,079
instead firms always have the option

942
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,119
just like we do of putting the money in

943
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,560
the bank rates

944
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,640
20% in the bank that I me a pretty

945
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,760
 good investment opportunity to

946
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,440
give up 20% in the bank to go build a

947
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,839
machine to buy a machine because I'm

948
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,079
giving up a huge rate of return of the

949
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,720
money sitting in the

950
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,760
bank so essentially what drives firm's

951
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,880
investment decisions is is the

952
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,160
npv greater than

953
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,680
zero firms invest if the npv is greater

954
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,200
than

955
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,680
zero that's it simple

956
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,520
rule and all they need to know is what

957
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,599
the revenues and cost will be but also

958
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,440
what the interest rate is going to be

959
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,880
now obviously they need to know the

960
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,599
future interest rate so they need to

961
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,480
know their expectations of interest

962
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,800
rates okay but in principle in a world

963
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,960
of perfect information all they need to

964
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,520
know is what the revenues will be the

965
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,880
costs will be and the interest rates

966
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,880
will be and they can ask then is my

967
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,240
money Better Off sitting in the bank or

968
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,440
being invested in this good in this

969
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,760
machine but that's the key Point once

970
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,240
again come back to the macro in which I

971
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,520
gave a minute ago the higher our

972
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,000
interest rates the less investment

973
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,599
because the more npv is going to be

974
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,240
driven Below Zero by The Upfront cost

975
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,000
being today and the revenues you earn

976
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,000
being in the

977
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
future okay questions about

978
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:55,319
that so the bottom line is both

979
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,839
consumers and firms face this indeed

980
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,760
consumers make investment decisions let

981
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:00,960
me give a simp Le

982
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,240
example about 20 years ago I had to

983
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,640
decide to whether to insulate my house

984
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:10,800
it's a very old house okay at that point

985
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,800
I had heating bills of $2,000 a year I

986
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,280
had $2,000 a year heating bills on my

987
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,599
house okay and I decid and the the

988
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,599
company that gives

989
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,119
um that uh provides

990
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:29,160
insulation said that by in insulating my

991
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,160
house I could lower this by 25%

992
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,119
forever I could lower my installation

993
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,400
cost by he cost by 25% forever if I

994
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,520
insulated but the cost of doing so would

995
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,520
be

996
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:49,160
$4,000 so I just did the npv I said look

997
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:52,079
should I do it what's the npv it's minus

998
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:55,880
$4,000 that's my initial investment plus

999
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,480
I save $500 the first year 25% of 2000

1000
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,839
plus 500

1001
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,760
okay plus

1002
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,599
500 over the interest rate because I'm

1003
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,599
going to say $500

1004
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,079
forever that's the calculation negative

1005
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,280
in the first

1006
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,079
year and then I'm going to get $500

1007
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,760
forever from doing

1008
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,960
this so what's the answer the answer is

1009
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,160
as long as the interest rate was less

1010
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,839
than

1011
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,400
12.5% it made sense to do

1012
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,359
this you can show that math to yourself

1013
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,760
as long as they trade was less than

1014
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:34,160
12.5% it made sense to make this

1015
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,160
investment but it was above 12.5% it no

1016
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,680
longer made sense to make this

1017
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:44,000
investment okay so the bottom line is

1018
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,960
that um the bottom line is that it all

1019
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,440
depends on what else I could do with

1020
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,400
that

1021
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,480
$4,000 that's going to determine whether

1022
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,760
I should make this investment or not and

1023
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,079
what my expectation of the interest

1024
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,240
rates are so we all face these decisions

1025
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,559
all the time anytime face the decision

1026
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,400
with a short run cost and a long run

1027
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,160
benefit we should be doing the npv

1028
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,040
calculation the flip side is anytime we

1029
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,599
face this with a short run benefit and a

1030
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,200
long-term cost we also do this so when

1031
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,240
you decide whether to

1032
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,559
smoke we'll talk about this in a few

1033
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,720
lectures in more detail you should think

1034
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,240
about the short-term benefit which is

1035
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,640
you know you feel better maybe if you're

1036
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,160
a smoker when the long-term cost is you

1037
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,040
die sooner but you know you die sooner

1038
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,119
off in the future so you got to decide

1039
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,000
what's that worth you have to discount

1040
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,000
it this is true so every example says

1041
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,400
you have to wait the present and the

1042
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,359
future differently to add them up and

1043
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:42,800
think about decisions you make

1044
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,800
today okay questions about that

1045
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,400
yeah uh it should always be

1046
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:53,880
R did I use where did I use

1047
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:57,800
I oh yeah you're right should be R

1048
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,800
sorry okay

1049
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,920
okay for those of you going to check my

1050
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,280
math at home actually the 12.5% comes

1051
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,400
from example where we don't get S where

1052
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,119
we don't get benefits the first year so

1053
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,359
the example will give me 12.5% it makes

1054
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,040
the math easy I assume the installation

1055
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,960
doesn't start working till year two okay

1056
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,599
just so in case you're going to check my

1057
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:18,920
math okay but the intuition is the same

1058
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,200
now let's go to one last example you

1059
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,520
guys it's like gez I'm thinking about

1060
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,400
professional athletes and retirement

1061
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,720
instating my house like this is so

1062
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,839
irrelevant to me let's come to example

1063
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,559
totally relevant to you or at least was

1064
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,760
to you four or five years ago should you

1065
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,480
go to college it's pretty relevant

1066
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,480
decision to a lot of people in

1067
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,280
America well this is a decision an

1068
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,160
investment decision over what we call

1069
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,880
we've talked so far about machines and

1070
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,400
investing in capital this is what we

1071
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,400
call investment decision in terms of

1072
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,760
human

1073
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,160
capital all the time we make decisions

1074
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,520
about how much to invest in

1075
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,359
ourselves every time we decide to go to

1076
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,160
college or or decide to get any other

1077
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:02,520
training or learn a new

1078
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,960
thing we are investing in our human

1079
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,680
capital we're are building our

1080
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,760
productivity if the new thing Sports

1081
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,000
you're not building your productivity as

1082
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,040
my wife constantly tells me but if the

1083
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,400
new thing something is actually

1084
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,200
productive for your job you are building

1085
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,119
your productivity you're investing in

1086
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:20,319
your human

1087
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:23,240
capital okay so for example let's

1088
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,760
imagine let's go to Fig figure 172 we're

1089
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,240
going do an example imagine that when

1090
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,079
you

1091
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,160
graduate you your decision when you

1092
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,720
graduate from high school is to go to

1093
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,119
college or not if you don't go to

1094
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,640
college you work from age 18 to age

1095
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,960
70 if you do go to college work from age

1096
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,359
22 to age

1097
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:50,640
70 okay now if you don't if you go to

1098
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,839
college okay there's two costs that you

1099
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,680
get if you don't go to college that you

1100
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:57,440
add right if don't go to college first

1101
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,960
of all you got to pay for college so

1102
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,119
during the four years that you're in

1103
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,280
college those that green area you're

1104
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:08,119
paying tuition that's why it's

1105
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,200
negative but there's a second piece

1106
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:13,079
what's the other opportunity cost of

1107
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,000
college

1108
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,119
yeah you could be working that's a real

1109
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,240
cost just like tuition you all are you

1110
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:20,839
all could be out there earning money

1111
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,720
right now see you're sitting here the

1112
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:24,319
opportunity cost this lecture is the

1113
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,359
money you all can be out making real

1114
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:29,520
money okay there's an opportunity cost

1115
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,880
you are for those four years not only

1116
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,440
paying tuition you're forgoing the

1117
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,440
opportunity cost that is a huge benefit

1118
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,280
to not going to

1119
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,359
college however if you graduate once you

1120
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,800
graduate college not F once you graduate

1121
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:47,800
college you earn

1122
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:50,720
more so you get more money for the rest

1123
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,640
of your life by being college

1124
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:57,200
graduate that is shown after year four

1125
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,640
in the yellow part of the graph

1126
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,240
Andrew I think we can draw this a little

1127
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,760
more neatly next time it's kind of looks

1128
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,480
like a preschooler drew it uh looks or

1129
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,079
me uh so uh we can draw this a little

1130
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,599
more neatly next time um basically the

1131
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,040
idea is beyond year

1132
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:16,640
four there's some there's some net

1133
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,359
benefit okay the net benefit is how much

1134
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,119
you

1135
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:24,280
get from earning more because you got a

1136
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,359
college degree Rel to earning Rel to

1137
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:30,160
just having a high school degree

1138
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,559
okay and that is the yellow area so if

1139
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,880
you decide whether to go to college you

1140
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,480
basically need to think

1141
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,720
about what is the cost and benefits well

1142
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,000
that's going to depend on the interest

1143
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,280
rate so for example with if the interest

1144
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,359
rate's zero then the npv of college just

1145
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,520
showing the table at the bottom the npv

1146
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:51,200
in college is way above the npv of just

1147
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,480
drop and going to high school should

1148
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:58,280
definitely go to college but once the

1149
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:00,880
industry gets above 3.5

1150
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:04,880
okay then I'm sorry uh the if the

1151
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,079
interest rate is I know that 3.5 is

1152
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,200
weird yeah ignore that 3.5 I don't know

1153
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,720
what that's doing there that's weird

1154
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,599
that's just I think that should be maybe

1155
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,200
one or something I don't know what's

1156
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:14,920
going on there but we'll fix that ignore

1157
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,280
the 3.5 at 2% you should still go to

1158
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,400
college at 4% you should still go to

1159
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,040
college at 6% you still go to college

1160
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,960
but once you get to 8% it breaks even

1161
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,200
administrative 8% you are literally

1162
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,440
financially

1163
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,680
indifferent you didn't go into college

1164
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,760
and not going to college and what's

1165
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,680
above 8% you lose money by going to

1166
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,400
college it's phenomenal right college

1167
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,119
graduates earn a ton more than high

1168
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,520
school graduates and yet the power of

1169
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,800
compounding you actually lose money by

1170
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,200
going to college once interest rates are

1171
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,079
above 8% it's pretty

1172
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,800
phenomenal that is why one of the major

1173
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:50,559
interventions the US government does to

1174
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,319
try to increase College attendance is

1175
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,799
student loans at a low at a subsidized

1176
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,920
interest rate one of the reasons one of

1177
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,880
the ways we try to encourage people to

1178
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,720
go to college is by giving them

1179
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,799
subsidized loans at a lower rate to make

1180
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,799
this a better

1181
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:05,720
deal okay and that's why that can be a

1182
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:09,240
very powerful tool to get people to go

1183
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:13,160
to college okay questions about

1184
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,119
that all right we'll stop there uh and

1185
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:18,280
uh we'll come back uh next time talk

1186
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,280
about uncertainty
