Coastal climate science activities and

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,400
experiments is an educational tool that

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,280
helps kids learn and feel how we are

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,400
going from elevated levels of carbon

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,720
dioxide in the atmosphere to harm to

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,480
human beings to marine life and to the

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,320
ecosystems on Earth. It starts with the

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,119
greenhouse effect. The air gets warmer.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,680
Warmer air leads to warmer water. The

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,920
water vapor is feeding into storms and

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,079
that's causing more hurricanes. When

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,000
students do this, they do a series of

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,559
experiments to get a sense of this

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,960
mechanism. The mechanism is physical or

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,399
chemical or biological. They're going to

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,960
see what it feels like to do that and

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,680
then say, where does this fit into the

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
overall cause and effect chain of how

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,360
increased carbon dioxide in the

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,840
atmosphere is leading to climate change

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,199
that's causing harm to marine life and

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,680
to human life. For more MIT moments from
