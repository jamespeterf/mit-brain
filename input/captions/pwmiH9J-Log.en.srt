1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,759
Next we have Michelle Lee from the

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,519
Zitnik lab at Harvard Medical

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,519
School. All right. Hello everyone. My

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,800
name is Michelle Lee and I'm a Burkowitz

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,119
post-docctoral research fellow at

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,279
Harvard Medical School. Thank you to the

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,640
organizers for this exciting opportunity

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,080
to share my work with you on

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
controllable sequence editing for

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
counterfactual generation. uh the

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
previous uh two professors gave

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,399
excellent uh primers into why how what

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,200
the space is that this work fits in. So

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,600
I will just jump right in. So let's

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,320
start with an analogy. So finish this

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
melody given only this single note. Now

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
you may say that this is an impossible

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,640
task because there are many

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,079
possibilities for what note can come

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,719
next. So what if I give you a few more

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,039
notes? Based on these four notes, can

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,280
you pick which note will come next?

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,680
Maybe picking the exact note is still

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
hard, but at least we can say based on

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,799
the pattern, the next note is probably

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,520
higher. Now, what pattern do we use to

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,479
deduce this? We looked at the trajectory

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,640
of the previous notes. First, there's no

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,799
change in the note. Next, the note goes

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
up. Then, there's no change again. So,

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,920
the best guess for the next note is

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,479
probably to go up. Indeed, that is true.

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
And here's the rest of the pattern. Now,

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,759
if you know how to read sheet music, you

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,159
may recognize this as the first few

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,080
notes of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,880
And continuing this music analogy,

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,720
what's the difference between these two

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,799
melodies? These notes look exactly the

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,119
same, but actually their identity

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,960
depends on context. As in, it's

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
important to recognize whether we are

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,040
interpreting the notes in the context of

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,360
the treble cleft at the top or the bass

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,119
cleft at the bottom. And not only are

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,159
the identities of these notes context

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,720
dependent, but so is the mood. Despite

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,680
the trajectories of these notes being

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,280
exactly the same, the top melody is a

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
very happy Twinkle, Twinkle, Little

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,600
Star, whereas the bottom melody sounds

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,040
kind of

53
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,280
creepy. Now, leveraging the trajectory

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,520
is not only helpful for inferring the

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,599
next note in the musical sequence, but

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,879
also the next state in the sequence of

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,440
cellular or patient profiles. Moreover,

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,680
the context such as the medication that

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,760
is prescribed at a specific time can

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
affect the future trajectory of the cell

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,760
or

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,599
patient. And so we introduced KFF, a

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,360
controllable sequence editing model that

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,160
can generate trajectories under any

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,720
given condition or context at any

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,480
specific time point. An example of a

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
condition is a certain medication that a

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,400
clinician prescribes.

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,400
Beyond conditional generation, we

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
hypothesize that cleft can be leveraged

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,519
for counterfactual reasoning about both

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
immediate and delayed effects. Suppose

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,920
we want to understand a patient's health

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,599
journey as a result of certain edits.

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,599
For example, what would the patients

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,080
trajectory look like if we gave the

77
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,080
purple medication in two hours?

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
Controllable sequence editing in

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,400
contrast to sequence editing requires

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
that none of the patients historical

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
data should change and that the model

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,920
should be able to make the edits

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,400
precisely at 2 hours. So our conditional

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,760
generation model KFFT learned temporal

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,239
concepts based on trajectories to encode

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,280
how and when certain conditions such as

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,120
medications should influence a sequence.

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
With these temporal concepts that

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,680
represent trajectories, KFFT is able to

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,680
selectively edit relevant time steps

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,599
while preserving unaffected portions of

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,799
the

93
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,120
sequence. So let's dive a little bit

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,599
deeper into KFFT's model architecture.

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,840
So KFTF manipulates sequences based on

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,799
user specified conditions and temporal

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,959
coordinates. So given a sequence, a

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,080
forecast time step and a condition

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,920
token, KFFT modifies only the relevant

100
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159
portions of the sequence while

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,080
preserving unaffected elements. For

102
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,879
example, based on a patient's historical

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,720
lab test results, KLF generates a future

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,040
lab test trajectory conditioned on a

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,000
given treatment. Now there are two

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,920
possible tasks enabled by KLF. Immediate

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,159
sequence editing and delayed sequence

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,239
editing. Immediate sequence editing

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,720
entails predicting the immediate next

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,639
time point like

111
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,720
t+1. Delayed sequence editing entails

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,160
predicting a time step far into the

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,720
future like skipping directly to t+1 uh

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,880
t + 10 instead of auto reggressively

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,919
imputing the intermediate nine time

116
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,680
steps. Architecturally, KF has four key

117
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,280
components. A sequence encoder f that

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,759
extracts temporal features from

119
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,160
historical sequence data. a condition

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,919
adapter H that maps conditions to latent

121
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,759
representations, a concept encoder E

122
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,600
that learns temporal concepts

123
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,720
representing trajectory patterns over

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,960
time, and a concept decoder G that

125
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,040
applies these concepts to generate the

126
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
subsequent

127
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,080
trajectory. The inputs of the sequence

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
encoder is the historical data of the

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,639
cell or patient and the forecast time.

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
And the output of the sequence encoder

131
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,280
is a hidden representation of the

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
sequence data and a time delta

133
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,199
embedding. Note that the sequence

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,400
encoder can be of any type such as a

135
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,479
transformer architecture, XLXTM and uh

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,280
architecture or even a pre-trained time

137
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
series foundation model. The input to

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
the condition adapter is the condition

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,720
token from a frozen pre-trained

140
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,000
embedding model. And these embeddings

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,840
are passed through the adapter to

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,960
project it into a shared embedding space

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,039
with the temporal data. To account for

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,560
changes in a cell or a patient due to

145
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,560
both time and condition, the time delta,

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,280
the time delta and condition embeddings

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,039
are aggregated via an elementwise

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,680
summation and this new condition

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,360
embedding is aggregated with the

150
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,360
historical sequence embedding and the

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,320
result may optionally be projected

152
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
through a FIFO neuronet network. A gill

153
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,759
activation is then applied to

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
approximate rates of change. And these

155
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,360
rates of change which take values

156
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,039
greater than or equal to zero are the

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
temporal concepts representing the

158
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,319
trajectories of a cell or a patient. And

159
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,120
finally the sequence at the forecast uh

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
time point is predicted via element wise

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,440
multiplication with the rates of change

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
or temporal concepts and the latest time

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,360
point in the input sequence. And the

164
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,960
objective function here is hooper loss

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,759
on the predicted and ground truth

166
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,280
trajectories. KFF has two key

167
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,199
capabilities. Forecasting sequences at

168
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
any time in the future and under any

169
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,759
condition and generating sequences by

170
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,039
intervening on KFTF's learned temporal

171
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,720
concepts at any uh specific time point.

172
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,880
And we hypothesize that these

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,400
capabilities allow us to examine the

174
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,960
trajectories under alternative

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,120
conditions and timings of conditions.

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
We evaluate cleft on two real world

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,199
domains. Cellular development and

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,440
patient health. To study cellular

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,880
development, fibroblast cells derived

180
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,880
from mice can be artificially

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,840
reprogrammed into various other cell

182
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,639
states in vitro. A cell state is defined

183
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,880
by its gene expression. Throughout

184
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,039
reprogramming, a cell activates uh

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,400
transcription factor genes at different

186
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,400
time points to change its gene

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,880
expression, which influences its

188
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,960
developmental trajectory. We construct

189
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,080
two data sets of cellular reprogramming

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,680
experiments using the Wington OT

191
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,000
algorithm. Note that WOTCF is a data set

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,400
of paired trajectories of original and

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,280
counterfactual trajectories. Between

194
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,960
these two WOT data sets, there are about

195
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,919
a total of 500 uh 5,000 trajectories

196
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,039
with 1,480 features of coariantss that

197
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,560
represent the expression of 1,400 genes.

198
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,880
And these trajectories have an average

199
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,560
length of about 27 and a max length of

200
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,120
37. The health of a patient is often

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
monitored through lab tests like uh

202
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,000
blood sodium level, white blood cell

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,840
count, etc. The history of lab results

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,759
across multiple patient visits as well

205
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
as candidate clinical in clinical

206
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
interventions like medications can be

207
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,240
used to infer the most likely future

208
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,160
trajectory of the patient's health. We

209
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,879
have two patient trajectories data sets

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,039
constructed from publicly available EICU

211
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,039
and mimic four databases. There are over

212
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,199
100,000 trajectories with either 17 or

213
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,080
16 features of covariants that represent

214
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,840
the values of 17 or 16 lab tests. And

215
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,879
these trajectories have average lengths

216
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,599
of 20 and 15 and max lengths of 858 and

217
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,199
949.

218
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,360
In our first set of experiments, we

219
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
evaluate KF's performance on conditional

220
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,839
generation of observed cellular and

221
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,519
patient trajectories. We compare against

222
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,519
several state-of-the-art approaches

223
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,000
including a traditional time series

224
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,480
algorithm V and a pre-trained time

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,600
series foundation model called moment.

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,640
Here the yaxis is mean absolute error.

227
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,279
So the lower error is better. Blue bars

228
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,320
represent KFT models and the gray bars

229
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,080
are baseline models. Remember that KFFTF

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
can leverage any type of sequence

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,000
encoder and so here we demonstrate the

232
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,360
performance of KFFT with a transformer

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,760
XLSTM and a pre-trained time series

234
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,399
foundation model as a sequence encoder.

235
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,720
Notably we find that KFTbased models

236
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,279
perform comparably or better than their

237
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,880
non-cliff counterparts. This suggests

238
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,800
that learning trajectories through

239
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
temporal concepts can improve

240
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,320
conditional generation capabilities.

241
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,320
We additionally construct a series of

242
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,839
increasingly challenging data splits for

243
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,120
the patient data sets EICU and mimic 4.

244
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,839
The Xaxis shows the similarity of the

245
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,600
train test split. So close to zero is

246
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:43,600
akin to a random split uh where um with

247
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,320
very high uh train test split similarity

248
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,680
and close to one is the most challenging

249
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,600
split with low train test split

250
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,160
similarity. And the y-axis again is the

251
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,720
mean absolute error. So as you can see

252
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,120
the cleft models in blue show much

253
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,760
better generalizability than non-cliff

254
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,720
models especially when there is low

255
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,640
train test split

256
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,560
similarity. Now beyond evaluating KFT's

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,200
performance on conditional generation of

258
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,959
observed sequences we interrogate KF's

259
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
ability to simulate trajectories to

260
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,000
answer whatif questions. So imagine if

261
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,920
we could test in silicone the effects of

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
a candidate intervention on the cell's

263
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,160
gene expression or patients routine

264
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
laboratory tests at a specific time

265
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,720
point. For example, what medication

266
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,680
should I prescribe? Should I prescribe

267
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,839
the medication now in one year in 10

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,120
years? In the interest of time, I won't

269
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
describe the causal inference

270
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
assumptions that we make. However, I

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,160
will empirically demonstrate KFF's

272
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,839
performance in counterfactual

273
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,680
generation. To benchmark KF's ability to

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,079
generate counterfactual trajectories, we

275
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,160
construct a solar trajectories data set

276
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,640
using the Wington OT algorithm that

277
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,560
consists of paired trajectories in which

278
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,680
one is the original and the other is the

279
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,600
counterfactual. Specifically, these

280
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,320
pairs of trajectories have the exact

281
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,399
same historical trajectory until a

282
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,519
certain time step when a counterfactual

283
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,000
action is done. Given this historical

284
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,079
sequence in this counterfactual action,

285
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,440
the remaining trajectory is simulated

286
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,360
using the Wington OT algorithm. So for

287
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
this experiment, we train the model only

288
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,360
on original trajectories and evaluate on

289
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,440
counterfactual trajectories in a zeroot

290
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,440
manner. On the x-axis is the number of

291
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,480
time steps after performing the

292
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,279
counterfactual action. On the y-axis is

293
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,279
the mean absolute error. Again, as you

294
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,120
can see, cleft models in blue

295
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,880
significantly outperforms baseline

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,920
models and generating the counterfactual

297
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,440
trajectories in a zeroot

298
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,440
manner. And finally, here's a case study

299
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,120
where we can precisely intervene on the

300
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
predicted trajectories of patients with

301
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
type 1 diabetes to try to simulate

302
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,399
healthier or sicker trajectories. And

303
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,160
this is done directly, this is done by

304
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
directly altering the values of the

305
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,399
temporal concepts. If you're familiar

306
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
with uh concept bottleneck models, this

307
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,720
is analogous to intervening on the

308
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,519
values of the concept bottleneck layer.

309
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,200
So in the center plots, the x-axis shows

310
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,440
the types of patients that we compared

311
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,560
the intervened type 1 diabetic patients

312
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,560
to matched healthy patients, other

313
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,639
healthy patients and other type 1

314
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,480
diabetes patients. The yaxis is the R

315
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,720
squar between the trajectories of a pair

316
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,279
of patients. So higher R square means

317
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,959
higher pair Y

318
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,040
similarity. In the top plot, we generate

319
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,760
future trajectories of patients after

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,120
decreasing their glucose levels by half.

321
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,800
In other words, we reverse their

322
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,120
symptoms. We find that these intervene

323
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,800
trajectories look more similar to

324
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,200
healthy patients in the first two

325
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
columns here than to other type 1

326
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,600
diabetes patients in the third column,

327
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,040
which is what we would

328
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,480
expect. In the bottom plot, we do the

329
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,399
opposite. we generate future

330
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,639
trajectories of patients after doubling

331
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,360
their glucose levels. In other words, we

332
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,040
worsen their symptoms and we find that

333
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,279
the intervene trajectories look more

334
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,120
similar to other type 1 diabetic

335
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,560
patients in the third column than

336
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,560
healthy patients in the first two

337
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,160
columns. Again, these are expected

338
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
results.

339
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,440
Altogether, such findings are

340
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,200
particularly exciting because they

341
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
suggest that we could use Kluff to test

342
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,839
different clinical interventions,

343
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,519
timings of interventions, dosages of

344
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,200
medications, and even treatment

345
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,560
regimens. To summarize, KLF is a

346
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,560
controllable sequence editing approach

347
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,639
that can conditionally generate cellular

348
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,560
and patient trajectories. We demonstrate

349
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,480
that KFTF can additionally allow us to

350
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,160
simulate trajectories to answer what-if

351
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,839
questions about the effects of a

352
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,680
candidate intervention on the cell's

353
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,920
gene expression or a patient's routine

354
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,560
laboratory test at a specific time

355
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,240
point. On the right is a QR code to a

356
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
pre-print and please reach out if you

357
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,520
have any questions or suggestions. Thank

358
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,519
you.

359
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:57,320
[Applause]

360
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,680
Thank you so much. We have time for one

361
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,440
question. very nice

362
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,680
presentation

363
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,760
actually a long

364
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,120
awaiting you know model that you know in

365
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,240
clinics uh across the river you know in

366
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,639
the hospital um we need that kind that

367
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,199
kind of model because uh you know the

368
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:24,720
trajectory sometime we call the Hamilton

369
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:27,680
curve you know uh at certain time point

370
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,519
whichever you intervene you know when it

371
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,199
going

372
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:35,360
downhill you know the condition getting

373
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,519
worse uh when it going uphill uh you

374
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,839
just give it candy you know the patient

375
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,040
can get better you know it's surprising

376
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,920
because a trajectory is a biological

377
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,839
mechanism that govern the underlying

378
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,760
disease uh and also uh I hope you could

379
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,079
you know including more parameter for

380
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,079
instance like in oncology when you do

381
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:02,320
the infusion of the medication the We

382
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:06,800
infusion time uh is it divided into two

383
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:10,160
time or one uh bullet post or you know

384
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,360
how long you uh you know infuse it in

385
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,279
one hour or two hour does make a big

386
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,800
difference. Thank you.

387
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,279
Yeah, that's a really great suggestion

388
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,199
and I want to emphasize that because uh

389
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,480
perhaps clarify and emphasize that this

390
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,160
is uh the generation is done in an auto

391
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
reggressive manner and so we could

392
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,560
indeed simulate the length in which we

393
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,920
do certain interventions as well as the

394
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,600
certain dosage and the type of

395
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,760
intervention. Thank you for your

396
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,600
comment.

397
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,000
Thank you very much to all the speakers

398
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,000
in this session.
