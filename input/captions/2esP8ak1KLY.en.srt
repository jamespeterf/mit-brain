1
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,160
um good morning good evening good

2
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,960
afternoon depending on where you're

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,440
joining us in the world today we're

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,120
broadcasting live at MIT Nano uh in

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,480
particular we're in the immersion lab

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,160
the immersion lab is a central facility

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,640
engaged with helping you MIT users

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,640
off-campus users leverage the powers of

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,199
immersion the the powers and tools of

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,160
gaming to advance science to Advance

11
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,280
Engineering to advance education so I

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,480
invite you we're here today virtually

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,199
and physically some of us but I invite

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,760
you to come knock on our doors send us

15
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,360
an email reach out to understand how we

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,880
can help you apply the the tools and the

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,600
language of gaming ambient physiological

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,400
monitoring novel displays novel

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,759
Technologies to really think about the

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,560
new ways that we can move the needle

21
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,600
forward together so today um we're here

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,600
to celebrate how we can think about the

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,680
novel ways of using augmented reality to

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,119
manage and explore infrastructure we we

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
know how to use the wheel um we're still

26
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,320
developing the ways that we're going to

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,119
use augmented reality so Arman today is

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,200
going to share with you some very

29
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,799
Innovative and novel approaches to

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,680
thinking about how we see Behind the

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,840
Walls how we engage with our our

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,240
physical through the virtual again um

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,479
enjoy ask questions and I'll I'll turn

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,479
it over to Arman and um take it away

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,840
all right uh so yeah my name is Arman

36
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,039
and I'm graduate student second year

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Masters in system design and management

38
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,959
program um and I'm also working on

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,760
Research how can we use augmented

40
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,160
reality to uh improve operational and um

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,760
maintenance tasks and uh just a little

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,400
bit about my background and how it um

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,360
motivated me on working on this project

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,239
and

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,920
exploring oh louder okay sorry can you

46
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,280
hear me um

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,319
is good okay right so uh I was working

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,800
in oil and gas before coming to MIT and

49
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,680
uh so the way that my work was involved

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,720
is around developing and building models

51
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,120
how can we represent the systems that we

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,000
were're dealing with like uh hydrocarbon

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,879
reservoirs uh subsurface systems uh and

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,319
how can we use those models to maximize

55
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,840
and optimize production uh that was uh

56
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,239
my main work involvement around the um

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,159
building and um optimizing the

58
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,720
infrastructure of the system and the one

59
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,440
of the interesting things that were I

60
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,120
encountered when we were dealing with

61
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,000
different um aspects of our work was

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,360
when we were um uh dealing with our

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,440
system we were modeling the like complex

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,120
uh U like reservoirs and we uh most of

65
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,000
them are you cannot really see them um

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,640
physically because they are located uh

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,439
like thousand meters under the ground uh

68
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,760
and um we had different groups were that

69
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,439
were dealing with the same type of

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,879
system but from the surface level so we

71
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,760
had different uh viewpoints on how we

72
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:43,480
were applying our uh um approaches on

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,560
how we can um uh yeah use our techniques

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,720
to to operate that system so I've seen

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,599
when we were doing the field visits to

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,480
to one of those uh like Wells sites uh

77
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,000
I've seen the issue that there was some

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,879
level of differences when we were

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,480
talking about uh how can we operate

80
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,200
system and we were speaking with field

81
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,319
operator and engineering department for

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,400
example and we we had different mental

83
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,360
model how we think about the system so

84
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,439
when we thinking about the model so we

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,079
would see on the right side uh that this

86
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,600
is how we um view the uh this

87
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,479
representation of the field or or the

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,000
Gathering system or the wellsite the

89
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:24,840
flow lines that's how we would be

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,040
operating um the field and when we are

91
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,479
talking to the field operator for from

92
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,240
their point of view they don't have that

93
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,320
understanding

94
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,280
was under the surface so they their only

95
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,960
focus was really is about uh looking at

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,880
the the like the number of valves number

97
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,600
of pipes which pipe should be uh

98
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,560
switched on and off and which Val should

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
be turned uh and that's where you had

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,680
that difference so when it was uh that's

101
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,520
where I was thinking about how can we

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,360
link that gap between communication of

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,800
having the virtual and Digital model be

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,880
uh integrated with the physical systems

105
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,240
and that's how I uh started to explore

106
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,600
how can we use augmented reality as a

107
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,320
tool to link that that Gap in the

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,520
communication and in the representation

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,039
of physical and and virtual systems so

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,840
now um that's where I started working on

111
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:18,440
developing a concept for around the MIT

112
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,240
Nano so what is a nano AR um Nano AR is

113
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,360
a digital representation of the system

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,520
of the Nano Nano facility uh and for

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,240
those who are not familiar um on the

116
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,560
call maybe uh Nano M Nano is a research

117
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,120
facility that's focused on on a research

118
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,880
around advanced technology and advanced

119
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,160
uh materials and nanot

120
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Technologies uh and it has multiple uh

121
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,319
facilities inside that building that we

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,280
can uh take uh as our potential concept

123
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,280
to develop um the model that we can

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,960
operate and test and and um uh and see

125
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,600
and get gather the feedback and and

126
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,160
learn something from it um for example

127
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,319
it has U on a sub uh subfab area there's

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
a COR characterization room

129
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,000
um there are clean rooms on the um on

130
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,479
the multiple floors there's a fan deck

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,240
that provides the uh equipment to filter

132
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,560
uh uh and remove the particles from the

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,919
air in the clean rooms uh and also

134
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,880
there's a a prototyping room so we have

135
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,400
a lot of material to to to play around

136
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,080
with and we had a really good amount of

137
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,280
data uh that we could collect and build

138
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,960
a model um around the around the

139
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,840
facility uh that's where it led us to

140
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,160
think about okay so what so we have this

141
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,039
data we have the models uh like building

142
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,160
information model of the of of the

143
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:40,080
system of M Nano how can we use this

144
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,520
model and uh develop a concept that we

145
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,680
can test around and and build an

146
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,039
experience that user can interact with

147
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,520
through augmented reality um and that

148
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,479
concept uh the first concept that led to

149
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,240
us to explore okay let's focus on

150
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,280
operational and maintenance tasks so

151
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,639
that let's think about what could be an

152
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:07,120
interesting approach how um uh operator

153
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,160
who would be um managing and uh um

154
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,520
operating the certain U aspects of the

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,720
building with certain like facilities of

156
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,520
the building like fandc for example to

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,960
operate the uh Val and switches to to

158
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,479
support the environment in the clean

159
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,240
rooms uh what would be useful for them

160
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,680
to have in the AR uh application uh or

161
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,360
in in that ER experience uh so we

162
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,400
started focusing and Nar Nar in it down

163
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,759
to augmenting the uh engineering

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,840
infrastructure uh and that's where uh we

165
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,840
started uh uh looking for the data or

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,199
the assets that we can collect from

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,360
those B models to only represent

168
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,360
filtration system um like fire safety it

169
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,919
could be piping um and uh yeah and

170
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,840
plumbing or ducts so things that usually

171
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,319
you wouldn't see uh around the space

172
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
when you were inside the room so when

173
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,599
you're in the room you you definitely

174
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,639
you you see walls and uh Furniture but

175
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,680
uh things that are behind the scenes

176
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,240
like Behind the Walls uh ceilings and uh

177
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
you wouldn't notice them so that's where

178
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,960
we thought okay maybe that would be

179
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,159
useful to test and see how can we

180
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,319
augment that and overlay uh on top of

181
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:22,520
the the physical uh systems here so

182
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,240
that's where we proceeded that's how I

183
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,199
uh proceeded further with development

184
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,000
but

185
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,080
before uh building the um the actual uh

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,560
scene

187
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,959
I just wanted to highlight some of the

188
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,560
constraints that we had in developing uh

189
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:38,360
this experience so the constraints that

190
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,440
we uh should keep in mind of When

191
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,719
developing um AR experience or any game

192
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
development uh application uh any any

193
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,560
gameing development has this constraints

194
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,800
that are like two opposing forces that

195
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,120
are pulling the um the performance of

196
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,959
the game or the performance of the AR or

197
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,079
VR uh simulation into different sides so

198
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,160
you have Graphics quality you have the

199
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:03,240
like the textures and the

200
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,079
um the materials so how realistic all

201
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,279
the objects look in in that uh in that

202
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:12,560
game or in that simulation uh that's

203
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,560
like one side of the of of this boundary

204
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,440
of this envelope and the other side of

205
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,640
the of that uh constraint is the game

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,640
performance so how smooth you want the

207
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,800
system to operate when you um when you

208
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,000
interact with the simulation so those

209
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,680
are two things that you need to keep in

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,839
mind you need to find the balance really

211
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,160
uh by applying certain features by

212
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,079
changing the texture by removing uh

213
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,920
number of polygons so that's where it's

214
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:41,519
more Arts and Science really when you TR

215
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,959
when you find this that balance because

216
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,320
it could be different Case by case so

217
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,600
that's where uh that's where it it

218
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,240
requires several iterations to find that

219
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,120
uh The Sweet Spot between these two um

220
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,800
constraints uh for the applications that

221
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,839
we will apply for development so we are

222
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,320
uh have

223
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,519
dependent on the unity so we'll be using

224
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,959
Unity for our most of our uh feature uh

225
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,839
adjustments and how we set up the

226
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,240
interaction uh between the uh the user

227
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:17,360
the AR player and and the uh and the

228
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,640
actual system so in our case MIT Nano

229
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,880
augmented overlay that's where we would

230
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,000
be developing and adding

231
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,959
interactions we we would be using also

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,399
blender for um changing the textures and

233
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:33,120
the materials and removing the U that

234
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,959
level of detail that will hinder our

235
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
performance so that's where we want to

236
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,480
play around a little bit with the

237
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,360
quality of of our objects and assets uh

238
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Autodesk is something that we use to

239
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,600
just to grab our uh initial source file

240
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,880
so Autodesk or any other any any outat

241
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,000
design uh platforms we can use uh it's

242
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,399
really for us it wasn't um a big

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,600
difference uh which source file we could

244
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,519
use but we we we need this 3D designs to

245
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,399
start with because we're using building

246
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,760
information model so uh that's where

247
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:12,040
that's how the um the MIT build so we

248
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,240
use that as as an initial first step and

249
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,920
we are also relying on meta quest uh

250
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,279
headsets and met Quest met sdks to

251
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:25,160
develop um interactions and um and Quest

252
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,000
Pro and Quest 3 was our choice for the

253
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,120
hardware for the headset um the reason

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,720
is because we want to have the pass

255
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,680
through uh feature the pass through just

256
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,079
for those who are not familiar uh in the

257
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,760
head in the VR and are you have uh the

258
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:44,600
this capability to see like to see

259
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,320
what's what around uh what surrounds you

260
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,079
in the space so you can walk in the

261
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,720
headset without taking them off uh

262
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,880
that's the pass through or see through

263
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,760
you can choose either one but the

264
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,880
difference between those two is that see

265
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,320
through is essentially it's a glass and

266
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,079
you can through look through the glass

267
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,839
and see the Holograms that are displayed

268
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,480
through the wave guides uh versus the

269
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,959
pass throughs where you just look at the

270
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,600
display and the headset using the camera

271
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,160
to to um to show you the visual of of

272
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,360
what you're seeing around you so it's

273
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,800
you're not really looking through the

274
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,600
headset is just looking at the display

275
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,160
inside the headset that's the main

276
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,480
difference um

277
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,120
yeah so first start with the data

278
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,720
collection uh so we had this massive

279
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,199
file for MIT

280
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,839
U bin file in um Autodesk navis works

281
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,279
and that's where we wanted to First

282
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,120
think about so if you think about the

283
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,160
concept you want to know okay where do

284
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,040
how do you want to uh organize uh how do

285
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
you want to start building this project

286
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,240
uh how you want to split the the

287
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,880
facility do you want to do this by by

288
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,399
room or by by a floor level uh there are

289
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,079
many different ways so this where you

290
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,519
need to be uh uh decomposing the uh this

291
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,199
large piece into smaller uh parts and

292
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,040
smaller sections that's where will be

293
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,120
much easier for your further development

294
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,839
so you need to think about these things

295
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,320
uh one step ahead and um but really it

296
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,120
also might require some iterations uh

297
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,279
but this is where we would start um

298
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,079
collecting our data you can also import

299
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:21,160
additional assets um if you need

300
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,160
something that's is not being built you

301
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,320
can develop yourself and uh you can

302
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,480
introduced to the uh to the AutoCAD uh

303
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,880
design or you can just import them into

304
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,399
the blender or Unity um it's really it's

305
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,920
it's a matter of what uh assets do you

306
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,079
need uh or what objects do you need

307
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,880
inside that build inside that experience

308
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,440
um so that was our first initial step um

309
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,199
yeah it's pretty much saying uh same

310
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,240
same thing uh except that if you think

311
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,360
about the what do you do you need

312
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,680
everything in that model uh probably not

313
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,199
if you look at one of the examples down

314
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,360
there um like you wouldn't need to

315
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,120
import walls for example that's where

316
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
we're not interested in displaying

317
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,680
everything that's visual so you don't

318
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,279
you you don't want to see um uh uh yeah

319
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,079
the actual like Furniture right for

320
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,920
example we want to only um focus on the

321
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,839
engineering infrastructure behind uh the

322
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,440
walls and the facilities uh so that's

323
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,639
where our Focus mainly um led to to to

324
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,880
take those

325
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,160
objects now the next step for in this

326
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,480
process is pre-processing of the

327
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,800
original files so that's once you import

328
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,440
the files from the from Autodesk or from

329
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,000
AutoCAD um that's how you you would see

330
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,079
them in in um in the blender uh in our

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,959
case and definitely this this is a lot

332
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,839
of material that you wouldn't need uh in

333
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:50,160
your in your design in in your AR um

334
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,320
simulation so you would want to start

335
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,639
thinking about how can you make this uh

336
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,279
Model A simpler um there are several

337
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,759
things you can do and U there are many

338
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,360
other sources that you can uh search for

339
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,800
how can you U remove number of Poes how

340
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:10,160
can you make the model um um yeah much

341
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,279
simpler um in our case this is what you

342
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,440
probably would be looking for this how

343
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,120
this how we represent our system so it's

344
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,920
mostly pipes and and and

345
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,800
infrastructure um and so first of all

346
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,680
once you import your U objects from

347
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,399
AutoCat you will see a lot of uh

348
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,560
different small pieces uh um bundled

349
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,639
together so you want to uh first thing

350
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,319
you you would want to do is to Cluster

351
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,360
all of those small smaller objects into

352
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,600
bigger components uh because that's that

353
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,920
way you can save uh computational

354
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,120
resources U because it's much easier to

355
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,519
process less number of components versus

356
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,600
the uh large number of components and

357
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,319
that's where you would want to kind of

358
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,120
group them and cluster um and also the

359
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:59,000
next step would be to remove number of

360
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,040
Poes um um do some um decimate um

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,480
function like there's some uh techniques

362
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,399
that you can do in blender to uh to

363
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,360
remove that extra level of detail that

364
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,079
you would wouldn't need really uh for

365
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,160
your uh for your AR experience um so so

366
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,920
the main thing that really helped us to

367
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,800
to move faster is just to focus on um

368
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:24,160
clustering objects removing some number

369
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,800
of poly polygons and um and also uh

370
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,160
material yeah you wouldn't need to to

371
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,040
have the material that are imported from

372
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,680
AutoCAD you can add the materials that

373
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,519
are much simpler uh from unity and

374
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,880
that's uh that's was our approach that

375
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,880
helped us down the

376
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,800
road uh now for the development part

377
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,199
this is the fun part uh this is where

378
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,560
you introduce all the features this is

379
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,279
where you decide pretty much this this

380
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,000
where you you can design your

381
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:57,880
interaction how you or are AR player is

382
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,120
interacting with the system and unit is

383
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,839
a very useful tool uh it has a lot of

384
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,360
Open Source packages that you can apply

385
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,679
um and uh even with low low level of uh

386
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,240
like or low skills um I mean

387
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,319
inexperience uh programmer can learn

388
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,199
this really fast there's many resources

389
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,160
and right now especially with Gen tools

390
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:23,039
you can uh script um any functionality

391
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,559
uh relatively easy and fast uh because

392
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,000
there are many things that are not

393
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,200
independent so once you create a script

394
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,480
you can just drag and drop uh that

395
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,679
component into the uh into into the

396
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,200
object and it should do the work and uh

397
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,240
yeah so the first when you start the

398
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,400
unity project you want to make sure you

399
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,760
you're setting up it in the right way

400
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,600
you have the right platform in our case

401
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:50,520
it was Android for meta quests um

402
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,880
devices uh headsets um yeah so we were

403
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,559
focusing on Quest 3 and Quest Pro mostly

404
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,080
pass through on uh we needed some hand

405
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,360
tracking so we want to make sure that

406
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,880
the the experience was as

407
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,200
uh as natural as possible so there

408
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,520
wouldn't be a need to to carry the

409
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,159
controllers uh in the hand so you you

410
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:13,080
would have to just use your hands to

411
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:16,799
navigate or uh switch the uh do some uh

412
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,559
buttons control or um yeah do like basic

413
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,039
stuff with your own hands and that's

414
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,080
that's where these headset have the

415
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:26,760
function to track your hands um and also

416
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,080
think about the setup for the uh camera

417
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,039
so the level setup is it eye level is it

418
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,799
floor level um for floor level you it's

419
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,960
when it's grounded to the to the um to

420
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,480
the level of your um of the floor or

421
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,240
your feet that's where you probably

422
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,159
would think about having Furniture uh uh

423
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,919
designed to that to that level but in

424
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:50,720
our case everything was actually

425
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:53,000
overlaid on top of us so it's mostly um

426
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,520
we're at the at the eye level of the

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,799
elevation so we wouldn't need to have

428
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,200
floor level U but things like that you

429
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,000
just want to think about when you set up

430
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,039
the project and there's uh multiple sdks

431
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,320
from meta XR that we also introduced to

432
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,600
have that interaction uh with hand

433
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,840
tracking and um other components as well

434
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,080
um I just want to go through like some

435
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,240
Basics things that we need to have as a

436
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,520
minimum uh to have that smooth

437
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,000
interaction is first one is is rigid

438
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,400
body so this is you where you want to

439
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
think about the physics of the objects

440
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,919
and rigid body is the physics component

441
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,039
of unity um where you can uh remove

442
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,000
gravity or you can add gravity you can

443
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,520
make the um objects static so they can

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,200
freeze in the in the location and in our

445
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,840
case that was essential because we

446
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,919
wouldn't want to have any facility we

447
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,640
wanted them to be anchored to a certain

448
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:51,559
uh spot to a certain location and that's

449
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,440
where uh we would have those um

450
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:57,679
components introduced uh and yeah

451
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,240
wouldn't need the gravity so the main uh

452
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,720
I guess feature that we

453
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,520
had to have from the rigid bodies the

454
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,039
Collision effect so if we're grabbing

455
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,760
some objects that's where you need to

456
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,400
have that Collision um detection and

457
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,840
collision detection is actually in

458
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,360
triggered by box collider I'll explain

459
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,559
it later um but this is things that you

460
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,400
were also would need to have for most of

461
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,760
your builds if you're developing AR

462
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,240
experience um yeah the Box collider is

463
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,840
actually showing the shape of that or

464
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,640
dimensions of the of the object uh yeah

465
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,400
in our case I had to

466
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,000
put like box collider around each room

467
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,240
so if you walk around the building you

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,159
would see um like it will have to have

469
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,320
some sort of a indicator or the area

470
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,159
where uh once you once you enter that

471
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,159
area or that box collider it will

472
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,840
trigger an event so that event could be

473
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,480
anything could be um activation of the

474
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,919
assets so you can make them visible or

475
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,799
invisible Once you walk between in the

476
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,400
room so that's that's just this this

477
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,039
basic stuff that uh help you down the

478
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,159
road when you're scripting and when

479
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,120
you're adding additional

480
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,039
functionalities

481
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,919
um yeah and then that's where you toggle

482
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,880
those like put all those together the

483
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,880
Box collider uh and the player so the

484
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,960
player essentially is your camera of

485
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,640
your Center eye anchor that you could um

486
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,320
you could assign as as a moving uh

487
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,159
collider so once your collider which is

488
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,880
around your headset is enter another box

489
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,880
collider of this room for example it

490
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,320
will activate everything around you and

491
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,360
then it will de activate everything

492
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,360
that's in in other colliders that's

493
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,799
that's like just basic stuff that you

494
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,120
you would have to um script and uh add

495
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,960
those components in the unit as separate

496
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,080
uh

497
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,200
component and then we also um like I

498
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,440
thought what if we just add some um

499
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,320
controls to the user uh if um if an

500
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,960
operator walks around the facility in a

501
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,279
AR headset maybe there was a need for

502
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,760
him to have some some level of control

503
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,720
what he wants to see what uh here or she

504
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,720
doesn't want to see in in the view uh so

505
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,720
introducing buttons to switch on and off

506
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,720
things would would probably make sense

507
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,400
in in this simulation uh and um and good

508
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,240
for us there was already a built-in

509
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,960
functions from meta XR sdks that we can

510
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,799
just grab one of those buttons and

511
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,559
introduce and in our case we we attach

512
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,320
those buttons to the to the hand to the

513
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,000
Palm so when you look like we have to

514
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,440
like uh uh stare at your at your problem

515
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,200
and it will show the buttons and you can

516
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,840
uh interact with that um menu I'll say

517
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
uh and it will it wouldn't show up all

518
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,000
the time in front of you so that's

519
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,400
another feature that another

520
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,080
functionality that you can U play around

521
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,679
with um

522
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,880
yeah and also you also need to script

523
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,039
the um what it does what what each

524
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,080
button actually activates when you press

525
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,640
uh when you press on that button like on

526
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,039
click uh you have to put a tag for a

527
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,360
certain asset uh and that's like when

528
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,000
you when you put the button um when you

529
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,000
press a button that's will it it will

530
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,240
activate those tags with those uh assets

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,799
that are assigned to the stack um it's

532
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,840
just some basic stuff and uh certainly

533
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,400
uh feel free to use the benefits of

534
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,480
having uh gen tools like GPT to help you

535
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,880
down the road with the scripting uh it

536
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,360
makes you uh it makes things much faster

537
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:33,080
now uh and yeah one of the last steps to

538
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,080
uh make sure that the simulation is as

539
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,880
natural as as possible is the the

540
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,960
calibration and scaling uh once you put

541
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,880
the headset you want to make sure that

542
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,039
uh the dimensions are in place and um

543
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:51,159
for example the in our case we wanted to

544
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:54,640
to match the um like the virtual uh

545
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,520
points of the like the far sprinklers uh

546
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,960
uh that are matched with the actual ones

547
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,559
in the in the space so um those

548
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,279
reference points as I would call them

549
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:07,440
are critical in in making sure that your

550
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:09,640
physical and virtual Alliance uh U

551
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,240
physically so that's where that's that's

552
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,440
the what could be the tricky part

553
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,200
because in our case the uh it just

554
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,400
turned down that the the actual model

555
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,360
was not up to date so it was hard to

556
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
match and then we realize that we

557
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,360
probably shouldn't be spending time on

558
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
matching the not up toate model so you

559
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,520
want to make sure that the model is up

560
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,360
to date um and it should follow and that

561
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,000
be that way it will be much easier to

562
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,480
match the virtual model with with the

563
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,399
actual asset um and

564
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,320
facility so it it could require some

565
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,799
back and forth uh um between calibration

566
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,240
and

567
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:49,559
testing yeah let's just see some demos

568
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,200
so this one it will show you how the

569
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,000
interaction will actually activate once

570
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,120
you the player in the AR headset will

571
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,120
walk around the

572
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,120
room and

573
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,640
yeah so this is how the field of view uh

574
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,880
looks and how the um so actually this

575
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,679
one uh has a built-in function in unity

576
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,039
that helps activate those assets uh not

577
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,640
by the Box collider that I was

578
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,480
describing but actually automatically

579
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,480
setting up the distance if you if you

580
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,880
want to have a certain distance where uh

581
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,760
the object would be activating uh that's

582
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:32,760
how it will look in the simulation

583
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,279
oh yeah s sorry so on in this space we

584
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,520
uh uh in in this view we have two types

585
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,440
of assets so we have the red ones the

586
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,360
red pipes are the fire safety system so

587
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,799
all the yeah the fire splinters that's

588
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,799
where the water would come to the uh for

589
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,159
that that's yeah basically it's a uh it

590
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:55,200
will be like Behind These Walls yeah on

591
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,320
on the up and and the the uh green ones

592
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,120
are the the ventilation systems the HVAC

593
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,799
so that's where the filtration and the

594
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,520
fans are uh located so I'll show you in

595
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,760
the next video that we can actually

596
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,200
we're going to do the walk around and

597
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,520
with the headset and it uh it should

598
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,399
show the uh how it looks beyond this

599
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,919
room yeah just also testing some other

600
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:19,880
small features like we can add some

601
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,679
distance like we can add the target for

602
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,440
example if we want to have uh uh

603
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,600
operator know where he needs to go uh

604
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,279
for a certain task we will add the like

605
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,320
a Target object and then we we can add

606
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,880
some simple navigation like you would

607
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,640
see in the game um like this navigation

608
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
Arrow uh which is very simpler approach

609
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,799
but there are many other ways that you

610
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,640
can go around this you can you can be

611
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:47,720
creative when you design uh these uh

612
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,720
features um yeah and

613
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,720
then and then we justed some buttons

614
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:00,279
control we introduced um things that we

615
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,000
can add some components for example we

616
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:05,840
were thinking about some troubleshooting

617
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,360
uh exercise if if an operator went to a

618
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,720
facility and he needed some um do some

619
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,760
um potential uh troubleshooting with

620
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,279
additional tools that he doesn't have or

621
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,840
he needs to match some certain design or

622
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,279
dimensions of of the tool with the

623
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,960
facility so he would press a button and

624
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,559
he would uh try them out at the at the

625
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,919
location this just ver the simple things

626
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,080
that you can also try but we're just

627
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,720
this is just a testing of how buttons

628
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,279
would interact and the last one yeah

629
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,840
this one is the uh the walk around uh

630
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,760
around the corner of the of this floor

631
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,640
so

632
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,440
yeah so you would want so that's

633
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,440
where yeah so this is now it's

634
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,760
overlaying at larger

635
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,840
distance everything that you would see

636
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,159
um that you would actually you would not

637
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,159
see but you would see this through the

638
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,760
AR headset so it's kind of like having

639
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,919
this X-ray vision

640
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,919
of the building um and this is just also

641
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,240
one of the testing it was in the process

642
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,000
of the testing so um some of the

643
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,640
elevation might be not up to the right

644
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,559
uh elevation but it was just like just

645
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,519
to show um how the process of

646
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:20,519
calibration and testing looks when we're

647
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,519
developing this type of simulation

648
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:05,399
right so now we went back to the to the

649
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:07,799
initial Point um and everything stayed

650
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:09,399
in the same place so it's anchored but

651
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,640
sometimes when you go around the corner

652
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,799
you might see some um misline that

653
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,799
that's the the thing about having making

654
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,080
sure that the scaling is is right and U

655
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:23,519
and it requires several iteration and

656
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,360
testing um yeah so but overall the

657
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,200
scaling uh in unity the one unit measure

658
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,640
is equal to 1 meter but could be off

659
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,679
sometime so you want to maybe add

660
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,960
additional multiplication to uh to

661
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:37,640
adjust for that factor um so there could

662
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,120
be some inconsistencies between the

663
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,640
model so now we have this concept so now

664
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,360
in we develop this workflow so how can

665
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,000
we do how can we uh investigate and

666
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,399
answer the research question does the AR

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,760
actually help us improve the task uh on

668
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:56,200
the on the job uh and things that we

669
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,600
want to measure are uh task completion

670
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,000
times uh number of errors or number of

671
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,279
mistakes uh and if there's any reduction

672
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,840
in the cognitive load uh these types of

673
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,679
uh uh measurements or metrics and

674
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,320
figures of Merit are are typical for uh

675
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,360
running a study with uh with a task

676
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,279
completion uh and also based on the

677
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,600
literature review uh it's a it's a it's

678
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:23,000
it's a typical type that you would

679
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,360
measure uh during the like experiment or

680
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,159
a study so we would be using the same

681
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,399
headset um the hardware of met Quest Pro

682
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,320
Quest three and we have several Concepts

683
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:35,960
to choose from um and the thing that we

684
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,120
would want to choose the the concept

685
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,279
that would require you to also compare

686
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,559
the uh the like a treatment group for

687
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,039
the uh for using the headset and the

688
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:48,159
conventional way of of doing some some

689
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,760
task without the headset and that's

690
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,840
where the key difference would would

691
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,519
show up um and yeah so I'll explain what

692
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,559
how we chose the uh our concept for the

693
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,880
AR study so this is the workflow that I

694
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,679
just uh went through uh yeah so now we

695
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,120
can choose this workflow is pretty

696
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,799
robust you can choose any uh facility

697
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,799
equipment you can overlay and run the

698
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,159
experiment with different objects now

699
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,639
and uh it it worked actually pretty well

700
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:22,120
um with the

701
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:23,480
um um so we had uh a file that we weed

702
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,440
from one of the companies that did the

703
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,919
scanning of this building so there was a

704
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,919
third party contractor who did the

705
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,760
scanning and we we're able to take those

706
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,320
files of the of the new uh I guess of

707
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,000
the area that's in the basement of

708
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,919
subfab area and we're able to run

709
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,080
through through all these steps and test

710
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,919
relative I mean within the couple of

711
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:48,279
days or or even weeks um just to show

712
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,080
that this uh process pretty is is pretty

713
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:55,080
um I guess it works well with any types

714
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,000
of complexity or any types of uh objects

715
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,320
that you can introduce in addition to

716
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,120
what we uh explored for the Nano AR so

717
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,240
uh that's where we proceeded to work on

718
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,440
the next uh object which is the the Fret

719
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,919
device which is fiber Extrusion uh

720
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,480
device it's a desktop uh um tool to

721
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,240
learn and teach how the fiber Extrusion

722
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,639
uh system works and to uh help uh

723
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,120
educate and teach how the U um

724
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:26,039
principles of manufacturing and advanced

725
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,240
controls uh and also uh data acquisition

726
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,679
so we took this we had this aat design

727
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,000
uh which was really good for us and

728
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,320
actually in this case we didn't have the

729
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,279
Autodesk AutoCAD files we just had the

730
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,360
on shape now which is the cloud-based uh

731
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,639
platform for AutoCat designs and we can

732
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,000
you could see that uh the files are

733
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:48,679
pretty high in in level of detail which

734
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,880
we might not need to have for the study

735
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,559
and once we uh start uh working on that

736
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,960
on the pre-processing part uh definitely

737
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,600
we want to have them uh these objects uh

738
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,840
in a much simpler

739
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,240
uh detail less detail level than we

740
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,080
would have them in in AutoCAD design uh

741
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,200
so this one yeah comparing to the

742
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,279
AutoCAD uh now it's it looks uh as a

743
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,679
more simpler version that should be fit

744
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:17,120
for purpose for us in our case uh for

745
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,360
the study uh it it should have more or

746
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,399
less same representation nothing is

747
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,200
really is is much different

748
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,120
um and yeah then you add it to the unit

749
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,960
to development engine and uh add the

750
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,440
features add the buttons interactions

751
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,519
and uh then you go and test uh and

752
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,840
calibrate same way that we did with uh

753
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:42,000
with a nano AR so this right now we're

754
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,320
just doing the calibration manually just

755
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,600
aligning uh how it how the object will

756
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,360
um will fit the the physical one and and

757
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,639
virtual one um but we're also testing

758
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,399
some other techniques like anchoring and

759
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:58,559
um that's where we we're still kind to

760
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,440
in learn in learning process proc of

761
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,039
doing this in a in a more precise way

762
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,679
but for us it it worked well just to

763
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,240
because since it's a is a very simple uh

764
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,119
tool and it's it's relatively easy just

765
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,839
to do it manually and much faster um but

766
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,480
for a complex system you might need to

767
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:23,079
have some some level of U automated

768
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,000
approach or uh or some control to to

769
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,760
apply anchors and um uh

770
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,359
rescaling uh techniques yeah this one is

771
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,359
just testing the

772
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:36,159
interaction with sub components so we we

773
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,599
had the we tested the guide system to

774
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,040
show to guide the operator to show where

775
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:46,159
to put the object uh or how to

776
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,240
assemble um uh this this device so

777
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:53,480
that's that that was part of our another

778
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,480
testing um Step

779
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,839
and then now that we have this

780
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,079
interaction in in operation we can go

781
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,800
run and run the study and collect more

782
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,040
data so in this

783
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,720
case we are showing the

784
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:27,720
virtual um components overlay on the on

785
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,640
the real uh thread device and we're

786
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,079
measuring how fast can we assemble

787
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,520
compared to the groups that are not

788
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,359
using the AR headset so this is the uh

789
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,359
just example of how can be it can be

790
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,359
used for for your

791
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,160
study

792
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,560
yeah and with that I think that's uh

793
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,560
that should be all for for my part

794
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,319
and we just started the study so we're

795
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,040
running this this is is the actually the

796
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,599
pilot uh and we we're testing how um how

797
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,240
human subjects are interacting with a

798
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,000
system and with a physical and if

799
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,160
there's any obstruction that we need to

800
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,920
keep in mind of but um so yeah we just

801
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,440
the first step was just to to make sure

802
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,599
that it's uh the AR uh model is working

803
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,079
and is functioning but based on the

804
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,359
research that we did on the literature

805
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,480
review um yeah it it shows that could be

806
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,280
promising uh for in like in General on

807
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,400
average um AR can help reduce the task

808
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,119
completion time uh in some papers it

809
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,880
shows that it could be by half like 50%

810
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,599
of the time and uh for number of Errors

811
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,599
it also helped reduce number of errors

812
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,319
that are made during the job and the

813
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,079
cognitive load which is the assessment

814
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:48,040
done by the NASA TLX assessment and that

815
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:50,000
also uh showed that the results can show

816
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,760
that it will help reduce that cognitive

817
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,839
load and we want to prove that if if we

818
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,839
have the same same results in our case

819
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:10,079
all right arm on thank you so much um

820
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,359
and so we're gonna take some questions

821
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,000
we're GNA leave a little bit of time uh

822
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:16,319
Kelly went ahead and submitted that in

823
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,280
chat so if any of you guys online have

824
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:22,880
any questions or comments feel free to

825
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,560
uh put that in chat or if anyone here um

826
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,520
yeah feel

827
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,440
free yeah so um he said given the

828
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,319
complexity of all the steps within this

829
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,720
system is there any automation that we

830
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:36,800
can do um to kind of expedite maybe

831
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,359
changes that happen uh in the future

832
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,280
yeah that's a good question actually I

833
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,480
was I've been looking at at this process

834
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,520
first by establishing what steps are

835
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,480
required to do manually so then we can

836
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,319
at least find the I guess the bottleneck

837
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,880
of in this workflow uh at this point um

838
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:58,640
if the design changes um I mean the

839
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,800
fastest way is is really is importing

840
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,680
objects into the I I mean any change

841
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,920
that that is made uh we just grab those

842
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,440
change and bring it to the uh blender

843
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,640
and that's where we will add that prefab

844
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,720
that only that section to our uh

845
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,480
simulation but how to make it automated

846
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,119
that's a good question I don't have an

847
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,040
answer on automation part right now but

848
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,800
I think it's something to to explore and

849
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,800
improve on the making it more

850
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:27,960
efficient uh and we have a question here

851
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,280
regarding the second project to the the

852
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,040
Fred project is it easy to understand

853
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,280
the system with many components

854
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,640
removed

855
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,160
um uh I wonder what kind of components

856
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,000
they're referring to in that

857
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,960
question uh yeah I mean if we remove

858
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,920
walls and things like that um yeah I

859
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,560
feel

860
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:56,760
like um when you're walking around the

861
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,880
facility uh you have general idea um if

862
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,640
the object object that are overlay they

863
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,599
are that's the where the calibration is

864
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,839
the key uh you want to make sure that

865
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,000
the dimension and the scaling is up to

866
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,760
as precise as possible because once you

867
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,480
remove them that's where it can get U it

868
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,280
can get distorted and if it's distorted

869
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,040
then that's it doesn't make uh sense to

870
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,800
to look at the object that are like

871
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,640
standing somewhere in the in the wrong

872
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,760
spot so if you that's if if you have a

873
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,880
calibration done right uh it should

874
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,040
intuitively tell your like tell your

875
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,280
brain I guess process that information

876
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,280
as naturally as possible that okay if

877
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,400
there there's a wall and behind the wall

878
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,839
there's a certain piping that's what you

879
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,599
would expect to see if you uh te that

880
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,000
wall apart right and that's uh that's

881
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,680
how like our understanding was that we

882
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,680
only need the features that are not

883
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:51,119
really visible uh to our eye so uh and

884
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,319
calibration would would help us avoid

885
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,040
any uh inconsistencies and yeah so

886
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,319
that's that's how our approach yeah and

887
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,640
that actually does allude to this this

888
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,720
next question how did you ensure the

889
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,960
correct placement of the AR component in

890
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,599
the real world so kind of that overlay

891
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,800
and I know we kind of talked about

892
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,480
strategies on how to go about doing

893
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,319
this uh yeah the um like finding the

894
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,200
right spot right yeah so this would be

895
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:19,240
kind of the calibrating yeah like the

896
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,880
reference point so anything that you

897
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,839
would see in in the virtual object that

898
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,640
are kind of sticking out of the walls

899
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,720
like one of the example was far as

900
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,560
Sprinklers and or or the the uh HVAC um

901
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,280
like the fans and the something that you

902
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,839
would you would see physically and you

903
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,640
would want to Anchor those objects

904
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:38,920
around around those reference points

905
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,119
that that was our strategy that we uh

906
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,079
that we chose but definitely we can

907
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,680
introduce additional things that we uh

908
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,440
because it's really sour design right so

909
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,599
we can add things that are actually in

910
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:53,800
the room and we can anchor uh how we can

911
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,319
initiate the the simulation around that

912
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,400
uh like the virtual space like for

913
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,119
example if we standing here uh we can

914
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,440
overlay uh like one of these cameras

915
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,480
right and we want to have to to initiate

916
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,720
the game when we are standing in in this

917
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,040
in the middle of this room and that's

918
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,760
how we can introduce that anchoring

919
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,960
effect and we can match the dimensions

920
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,760
of of this like for example of these

921
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,240
cameras around here so that's kind of

922
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,520
just example how can you go around this

923
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,560
uh uh on finding the right spot and

924
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,839
finding the right placement of virtual

925
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,359
objects compared to the physical ones

926
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,880
yeah

927
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,160
thanks uh great question question keep

928
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,880
them coming uh is that Poss is it

929
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,280
possible to combine the physical

930
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,319
property other than shape of an object

931
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,079
into the AR system um so perhaps

932
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,280
material or

933
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,319
Texture

934
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,079
um might be so I think you might be

935
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:51,040
referring to haptics in

936
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:55,680
that

937
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:59,240
prop um physical properties

938
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,240
um yeah sure

939
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,440
[Music]

940
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,119
MH yeah for that we we'll need more data

941
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,079
and uh if there's a real time uh yeah

942
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,200
for the question uh can we actually see

943
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,920
if there's any like a pressure or

944
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,480
temperature or or some sort of a uh like

945
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,680
measurement behind the actual uh behind

946
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,599
the virtual uh representation of the

947
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,119
system so yeah for uh for that we'll

948
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,920
definitely need more data we'll need

949
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,200
more um data acquisition linked to the

950
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,800
to the actual system but right now it's

951
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:43,040
all um I'll say not live it's it's more

952
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:46,119
static so once we build it it's the file

953
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,599
just U being sent to the headset uh and

954
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:49,760
we don't have that feedback like

955
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,079
real-time feedback loop that you would

956
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,720
call that you would expect from the

957
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:54,319
digital twin right so that's where

958
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,119
digital twin kind of comes into into

959
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,839
play so we we want to have that real

960
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:02,280
time interaction and that will be uh a

961
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,400
little bit heavier uh to process that

962
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,599
information because you need to have uh

963
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,359
some some level of control and uh we

964
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,319
need to connect the headset to to a

965
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:15,680
cloud and then where we can build those

966
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:18,760
uh like me take the measurements uh

967
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,920
acquire the data and and also overlay in

968
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,960
real time that I think that's

969
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,359
interesting uh thing to test but at this

970
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,079
moment we only have a static version of

971
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,839
of the of the building

972
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,800
it'd be a great use case though seeing

973
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,400
some real time real time data coming

974
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,960
through definitely

975
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:40,440
yeah um all right and anybody else I

976
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,000
know we we Arman kind of threw threw a

977
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,680
lot at you guys you know talking

978
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,599
everything about the development and

979
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,599
jumping into unity and have you used

980
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,640
Unity before jumping into the project

981
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,839
yeah that's the the thing that we I

982
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:57,599
haven't used Unity uh in my in my life

983
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:59,240
before uh and this is where um I felt

984
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,760
that the learning this process from

985
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,760
scratch was helped me find the I guess

986
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,880
the the bottlenecks or things in the

987
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,839
process where we can help improve and

988
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,280
focus on the on the on the right steps

989
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:15,160
to uh to get the model built uh as as

990
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,559
like fit for purpose right so we don't

991
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,800
spend too much time on developing things

992
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,400
that we don't we don't need for the

993
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,839
experience uh yeah but for and actually

994
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,040
we tested on L students that we just

995
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:28,480
joined this semester so we have this

996
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,200
workflow and we uh intr them to this uh

997
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,720
to this new uh like way of building this

998
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,839
experience and we were they were able to

999
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,480
catch this really fast so I think now

1000
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,480
it's becoming a really powerful tool to

1001
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,200
introduce this to new students uh and

1002
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,480
they can learn and and develop this in

1003
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,880
in uh in a much faster and efficient way

1004
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,960
yeah and it's just working with VR and

1005
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,160
AR as a headset and all of you know with

1006
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,200
all of the complications and limitations

1007
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,240
that you have on that because I like

1008
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,119
what you mentioned early on kind of

1009
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,040
balancing both the techn techical and

1010
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,520
and how we can get kind of utility out

1011
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,520
of this but also you know the artistic

1012
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,280
side so figuring out what kind of

1013
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,280
changes you need to do with the assets

1014
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,280
but still being able to convey that

1015
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,240
information and sustain the performance

1016
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,280
on the headset because this has this has

1017
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,599
to be Standalone right you do have to

1018
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,559
walk around um so I just thought that

1019
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,520
was incredible journey that you kind of

1020
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,520
took us on and then you're asking is

1021
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,520
this useful right jumping into that that

1022
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,400
research side of thing so definitely

1023
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,119
stay tuned uh everybody else to to see

1024
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,359
what the outcomes on that uh project is

1025
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:37,960
but in the meantime um I think that does

1026
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:40,000
bring us down to our hour um so if

1027
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,359
anybody does have any kind of continued

1028
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,400
questions uh you can shoot us an email

1029
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:48,960
at immersion at mit.edu that comes right

1030
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,559
right to us but we will be back in 2025

1031
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,040
um we don't have anything anticipated

1032
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:56,079
for the December for our imers Series so

1033
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,960
stay tuned for early January and um

1034
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,800
thank you all for joining us today

1035
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,800
thanks Armon thank you
