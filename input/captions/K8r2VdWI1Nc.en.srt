1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,640
hi everybody I'm back uh great to be

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,080
back here and um a lot of what I'm going

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,080
to say sort of uh I think parallels what

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,040
Andy just said which is that you know

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,200
we've got to get better at understanding

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,119
what's going on and we need better data

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,960
and so we've come up with a way of doing

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,600
that

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,880
for uh uninstrumented parts of an

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,760
operation so yes you can right now do a

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,400
lot of stuff if you have great data

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,320
analysis with machines but what about

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,160
people and so that's what we approached

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,720
in our uh when we started this company

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,719
we are a Google Cloud partner but we

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,520
also work with other clouds but Google

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,600
uh we've been working them first and so

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,960
they are also promoting our system to

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,640
all their uh all their customers as well

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,680
so let's go to the next slide here if I

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,039
can okay there we go um

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,000
so the big problem that we noticed when

23
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,359
we started out talking to manufacturers

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,079
is that a lot of parts of an operation

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,879
are very much people Centric there are

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,760
machines that they use but people are

27
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,640
using the machines the fully automated

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,640
part parts are are are actually pretty

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,159
much minority and so you can get this

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,960
kind of data like oh the lathe stopped

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,840
and so we have this overall equipment

32
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,880
effectiveness of 34% this cncc machine

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,240
is running um that's great but then

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,840
there's all these other parts of the

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,880
operation that are just not really

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,840
giving good data if they do they may

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,680
have people uh scanning things with a

38
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,400
barcode scanner saying I'm just going to

39
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,720
start a build and they scan something

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,119
and then an hour later you get another

41
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,680
scan saying I just finished a build now

42
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,640
sometimes they forget to scan out and

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,640
then you have bad data so this data

44
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,680
quality when you're relying on people

45
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,159
whose job it is not really to enter data

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
to be in charge of that data quality is

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
not so great who's who's had a problem

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,159
where they got a reason code from a

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,560
manual data entry that was not very

50
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,759
helpful who's ever had an unhelpful

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,479
reason code anyone yeah okay admit that

52
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,119
um so what we built was a way to use

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,640
off-the-shelf cameras to uh have our

54
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,039
Machine Vision system recognize people

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,360
and tools and parts and equipment and

56
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,240
all sorts of other parts of the process

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,759
and track them all the time and the hard

58
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,560
part was when we started out you know

59
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,720
the kind of um technology that was

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,360
available you could track things but it

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,000
couldn't tell us what the relationships

62
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,920
were so being MIT people we said I guess

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,120
we're have to invent our own engine to

64
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,200
understand relationships and so we went

65
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,560
to the drawing board and for two years

66
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,360
we we had to invent a new kind of AI

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,080
system that could actually understand

68
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,599
all the relationships all the time

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
between all these things it's not easy

70
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,200
especially if you want to do it in real

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,560
time and we had to also do it in real

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
time because our customers want to know

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
now they don't want to know next week

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,680
what happened today they want to know

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,560
now what's going on right now because

76
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,040
our customers are plant managers uh line

77
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,920
supervisors operational leadership

78
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,640
continuous Improvement leaders quality

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,720
leaders safety leaders all these people

80
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,280
are our stakeholders and so we had to

81
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,599
have something that was fast so we use

82
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,680
Google Cloud for the cloud operations

83
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,680
right now we can use other clouds too

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,680
but um we also have an on Prem solution

85
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,599
and this has been very attractive to

86
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,720
some of our customers because they have

87
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,280
a place where there are a lot of people

88
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,239
working that doesn't have a gigabit

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,440
connection who has a place without a

90
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,840
gigabit connection where you got a lot

91
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,120
of people working anybody out there yeah

92
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,599
and uh so without a gigabit connection

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
sending 100 streams of video to the

94
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,360
cloud is not possible but we can send it

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,080
to a server here that processes the

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,959
video locally and does a lot of the

97
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,959
Insight generation right there on a

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,080
server on the local area network and

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,720
then can also communicate with the cloud

100
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,319
and so again you know having many ways

101
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,720
to plug into this has been valuable we

102
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,319
had to build our own dashboard because a

103
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,920
lot of our customers aren't using

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,000
Tableau or Microsoft powerbi they can't

105
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,319
really build dashboards themselves so we

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,599
built a a very nice dashboard that a lot

107
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,439
of our customers are very happy with if

108
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,519
they don't like that they can use apis

109
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,760
to pull our data and visualize it any

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,439
way they want uh we also have our own

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
alerting system so we send out uh text

112
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:00,000
messages and emails and other kinds of

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,120
alert systems when our agents uh Det

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
something that needs really rapid

115
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,640
response so that's the other thing that

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
you know there's a lot of who's heard

117
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,480
the word agent lately in in this AI

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,040
stuff right A lot of people talking

119
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,640
about agents and so what we think of

120
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,360
these are is visual agents and that's

121
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,799
sort of I think an upand cominging uh

122
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
Frontier you want an agent that not just

123
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,519
can read through all the texts and all

124
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,240
the emails and all the and and and and

125
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,919
and pull out something for you you want

126
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,280
an agent that can be your eyes uh so you

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,039
can see when there's a safety issue

128
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,759
coming up or you can see when um you

129
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,960
know there there's there's there's these

130
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,360
places where people should be working

131
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
and no one's there maybe they got told

132
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,840
to go somewhere else but they shouldn't

133
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,840
be doing something else they should be

134
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,759
back here right so that kind of when

135
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,120
that stuff happens our system can tell

136
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,639
the right people hey check this out

137
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960
there's something going on here that you

138
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,919
need to look at and that's been the aha

139
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,360
moment for our customers like wow this

140
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,039
agent is actually helping me out a lot I

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,160
really appreciate that so that's sort of

142
00:04:53,039 --> 00:05:01,960
what we offer to our customers and we've

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,639
seen really clear Roi from this um you

144
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,759
know these are the sort of very clear

145
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,320
ones that are quantifiable like we have

146
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,560
a customer where they actually measured

147
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,280
their capacity month to month after six

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,800
months because they were able to

149
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,000
identify a lot of the unexpected

150
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,319
downtime this is manual downtime this is

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,160
time when people are just waiting around

152
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,080
for parts people are waiting around for

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,080
uh a part to be moved into their area

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,759
where they can start working on it

155
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,039
because the pre previous team finished

156
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,319
what they were doing that kind of stuff

157
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,319
added up and that is continuing to

158
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,960
increase their productivity so this is

159
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,000
without buying any new Capital Equipment

160
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,840
no new machines not hiring any new

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,479
people this is just everything as it was

162
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,160
but pulling out the wasted time using

163
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,800
our agents um we have customer also same

164
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,520
same some some customers use both so

165
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,240
this one A different customer but they

166
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,880
also do productivity stuff they also do

167
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,960
safety stuff and this is a big cultural

168
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,600
shift we talked about cultural changes

169
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,720
cultures of safety um are important and

170
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,280
uh so to get that kind of change in

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,880
culture if you have an Guardian Angel

172
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,919
which is an AI watching for near misses

173
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,800
and uh accidents that are about to

174
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,319
happen and then everybody knows that

175
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,360
these near misses have been adding up

176
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
this week they they start changing the

177
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,560
way they behave because they now it's

178
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,720
not just uh I'm just doing whatever I

179
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,919
want no one's seeing what I'm doing now

180
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,800
I could die and this thing is actually

181
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,199
making me be better so that's that's

182
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,039
that's important this is the kind of uh

183
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,120
data view that we have in our dashboard

184
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,319
you can sort of see if anyone's ever

185
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,880
analyzed like uh performance of a

186
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,280
machine I I'm not treating people like

187
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,080
machines I don't want to do that but on

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,919
the other hand there's some really great

189
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,960
science of manufacturing and science of

190
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:48,160
operations that comes from thinking

191
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,039
about things like you know uh what is

192
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,199
this time loss what is the par on the

193
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,520
breakdown of time loss we can do that

194
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,520
now for a fully manual uh location so if

195
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,879
you're building big things big expensive

196
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,759
things and one day of is a giant problem

197
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,800
for your manufacturing operations team

198
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,680
getting this kind of report daily about

199
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,039
what our time loss was every day it's a

200
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,720
big deal and so that's how we've been

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,120
able to do all this kind of stuff and

202
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,759
you can see cycles and all that kind of

203
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,759
stuff here I'll do more demos of my

204
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,199
booth over there so come by afterwards

205
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,680
if You' like to see more about what this

206
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,000
does um we are highly secure and uh so

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,360
that's gotten us into a lot of places

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,319
where they're worried about data

209
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,840
security especially you know on Prem and

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,840
the cloud that helps with security and

211
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,240
um why Houston uh I think Texas is a

212
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,840
great state because it's got this

213
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,520
incredible ranking compared to

214
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,680
California it's the second one here in

215
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,199
terms of patent filings and also um in

216
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,840
terms of the Metros you know we got

217
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:53,680
Dallas right there so um we've got a lot

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,039
of great Texas power in in high-tech in

219
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,919
Ai and I think this is a great place for

220
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,199
