1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,000
and let's welcome um Nicolas stransky um

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,719
the corporate VP of data science um of

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
serice Life Sciences um Nico the floor

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,240
is yours I know that there is a slight

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,119
change on the titles of the slide so

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,279
I'll leave it to you to introduce the

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,840
title thank you all right so I'm going

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,760
to take us in a slightly different

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,679
direction today than uh the first couple

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,119
talks um and uh the reason for that is

11
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,960
because drug Discovery spans really a

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,239
lot of topics especially in Industry

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,640
where in drug Discovery first we need to

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,480
understand what the biology of the

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,000
disease is what potential targets could

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,399
be all the way down to identifying a

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,840
patient population so who are we going

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,160
to treat how are we going to find those

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,000
patients uh how can we predict whether

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,600
they're going to respond or not to a

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,800
particular drug um and of course drug

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
Discovery also includes like coming up

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,680
with the the drug or identifying the the

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,359
the relevant Targets in the the the

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,080
structure of those targets and so what I

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,320
want to focus on today is aspects that

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,600
relate to our use of genomics and

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,479
Diagnostics and molecular data to better

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,680
understand uh patient populations and

30
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,640
predict uh drug response and

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,520
outcomes so uh my name is Nikos trky I

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,960
lead the data science at Caris Life

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,119
Sciences which is a cancer diagnostic

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,079
company based in Texas and Phoenix

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,640
Arizona and also here in Cambridge where

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,759
as a data science team that that I

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:42,360
lead so um to to start with a little bit

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,680
of additional context U 30 years ago um

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,439
the the first targeted therapy was was

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:52,280
invented IM matb against Abel which is a

41
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,200
kyes that drives acute maloid leukemia

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,479
and following that and that revolution

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,680
in the care of that disease there was an

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,360
enormous effort to identify more of

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,600
these targets

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,079
uh more more kindnesses and other kinds

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,640
of targets that could be uh treated

48
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,720
directly with a with a drug in a

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
targeted fashion meaning precisely

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,239
inhibiting what's causing the the

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,560
disease and shortly following that uh

52
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,000
that Revolution there was the rise of

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,319
the what we called Next Generation

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,319
sequencing uh with driven by multiple

55
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,040
companies who really revolutionized the

56
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,599
space not with that exact sequencer in

57
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,879
the 2000s but but still uh there was an

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,000
enormous revolution in the the

59
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:40,200
generation of genomic data which led to

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,120
multiple improvements in the field one

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,840
much better molecular characterization

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,239
of diseases cancer and other

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,319
diseases uh that led to better Target

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,080
identification but also gave us the

65
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
tools and the data to identify those

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,000
patient

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
populations and then because of that

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
enormous rise in the amount of data that

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,280
was generated genomic data we needed

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,360
better tools to analyze those data and

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,480
tease out what could be driving disease

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,680
what could be specific targets and what

73
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,239
could be uh uh subsets of the the the

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,239
patients that might respond to a drug

75
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,080
and and AI or ml or or extremely useful

76
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,599
for that and that's what I want to to

77
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,599
talk about

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,080
today so um following that rise of of

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,640
the use of sequencing we went from a

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,879
symptomatic diagnosis uh there's a mass

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,840
there's a different uh uh there's

82
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,640
different appearance of of a a certain

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,599
condition to really profiling

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,840
molecularly cancer and other diseases to

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,760
understand what genes are involved what

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,640
what mutations any kind of other

87
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,680
alterations are involved so that we can

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,400
very effectively match a drug in a

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:02,879
patient uh when when it comes to either

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,879
the response or or the um the

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,000
outcomes the um the the the the the drug

92
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,360
space or the treatment space in in

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,959
cancer uh comprises a lot of drugs that

94
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,959
are associated with a particular

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,280
diagnostic so the so-called companion

96
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,400
diagnostic which require that we

97
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,040
identify the precise molecular

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,199
alterations that would allow the doctor

99
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,240
to prescribe a drug to treat the disease

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,800
and in this uh slide are the depicted

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,960
multiple of these these targeted

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,440
Inhibitors so they're mostly uh uh small

103
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,160
molecule Inhibitors on those slide

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,440
together with the kind of molecular

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,520
alterations that need to be detected in

106
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,759
order to prescribe the drug so that's

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,360
really a combination of the the

108
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,960
availability of the drug and the ability

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,960
of the the Physicians to identify those

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,759
patients and that's why the field of of

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Diagnostics uh is is so important

112
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,479
because there's a there's these are not

113
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,759
drugs that can be prescribed to all

114
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,240
patients for a particular cancer these

115
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,360
are drugs that need to be prescribed to

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,600
a patient when they have the particular

117
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,800
alteration and that's uh this the then

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,840
the enormous challenge of identifying

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,680
those patients because it requires very

120
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,319
Advanced uh uh profiling techniques very

121
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,080
costly profiling techniques for those

122
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,080
cancers uh that span multiple

123
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,880
Technologies and the reason why um I'm

124
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,960
having um the reason why I have this uh

125
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,080
this U diagram in the middle is because

126
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,000
we're spanning DNA sequencing RNA

127
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,080
sequencing uh protein profiling through

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,120
imunohistochemistry and other

129
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,600
Technologies and all of these need to be

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,800
done most of the time all on the same

131
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,080
sample to identify which uh drugs might

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,639
be prescribed to to a

133
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:04,039
patient so with that context uh Caris is

134
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,280
diagnostic company were uh a a mostly a

135
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,280
sequencing company generating an

136
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,919
enormous amount of sequencing every day

137
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,319
24/7 uh probably the the biggest

138
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:19,840
sequencing company uh there's

139
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:22,560
50 actually many more uh 50 Nova 6 uh U

140
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,120
Down in in Arizona to perform all the

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,400
sequencing 50,000 uh cancer samples per

142
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,639
month uh that's tissue samples there is

143
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,880
also liquid profiling from blood

144
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:38,520
biopsies uh and uh he hematological

145
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,319
malignancies profiling soon as I said

146
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:46,199
there's labs in Arizona in in Texas and

147
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:49,479
data science in Cambridge so the the the

148
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,080
the kinds of diagnostic the kind of

149
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,360
diagnostic that need to be performed

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,520
employ uh these various data types that

151
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,160
I mentioned before DNA sequencing RNA

152
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,000
sequencing which allows us to identify

153
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,680
certain fusions or certain gene

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,720
expression DNA of course allows us to

155
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,000
identify point mutations also fusions

156
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,680
and and uh copy number operations and

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,240
and other kinds of operations that are

158
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,440
important for the prescription of drugs

159
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,800
uh and then of course through protein we

160
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,919
can identify certain markers that would

161
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,319
be overexpressed or present and allow us

162
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,639
to to prescribe certain drugs so all of

163
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,120
that is very important for Diagnostics

164
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,280
but it's also very important for drug

165
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,919
Discovery and it enables our R&D

166
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,840
identifying new targets identifying new

167
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,520
patient

168
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,000
populations and the the nous amount of

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,080
data that's available to to us at Caris

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,720
and elsewhere enables these such

171
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
activities at the beginning of drug

172
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,599
Discovery so that's what I want to to

173
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,000
focus on today so let's start with an

174
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:57,319
example of one such diagnostic that has

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,960
existed for for 20 years on type DX it's

176
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,879
a diagnostic that's used in certain

177
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,120
breast cancers and predicts the

178
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,720
likelihood of

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,319
recurrence uh after after treatment with

180
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,319
a certain certain therapy it's based on

181
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,599
the gene expression of of multiple genes

182
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,800
uh that are profiled through rtpcr so

183
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,360
it's an old technology it's robust but

184
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,120
it's it's been around for for decades

185
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,639
and then there's a very simple score

186
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,840
that that's uh calculated that uh gives

187
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,959
a numerical number that allows to to um

188
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,880
uh uh determine the the next course of

189
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,080
treatment and there are multiple such

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,159
signatures of scores that exist in the

191
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,919
industry and this one seems um pretty

192
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
pretty simplistic although this

193
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,120
discovery was not but uh there's

194
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,720
probably better tools that we can employ

195
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,920
today through the enormous availability

196
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,120
of of data that's generated every day by

197
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,000
by many companies and through the use of

198
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,000
of machine learning and other techniques

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to come up with better signatures

200
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,440
so with that

201
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,519
uh we need better signatures we need

202
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,360
better signatures because uh the the the

203
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,959
um we because we have the the POS the

204
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
the we have the the means of doing so

205
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,320
through better data and better

206
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,360
techniques but also because the current

207
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,480
ones don't work that well and there's

208
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,920
not perfect matching between drugs and

209
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,760
patients and I want to start with a

210
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,320
quote that seems a little Grim but but

211
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,760
is is true most drugs fail most patients

212
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,120
most of the time most drugs are not

213
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,200
going to work on on on on a particular

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,000
disease uh most patients are not going

215
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,839
to respond to a part particular drug and

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,959
when they do they're actually sadly

217
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,519
going to often times recur and and U

218
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,959
progress in their disease and that's

219
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,079
even true for the the the recent

220
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,240
generations of of therapy So-Cal Target

221
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,480
therapy that are much more tailored to

222
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,040
an individual's tumor so we need better

223
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,360
signatures because we need to match much

224
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,720
better the drugs and the

225
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,640
patients on top of that drug resistance

226
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,640
which is a phenomenon that either occurs

227
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,519
uh uh right when a patient is given the

228
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,200
drug or that that cancer evolves to to

229
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,680
um to to have it not respond to the drug

230
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,120
anymore drug resistance is not due to uh

231
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,360
to any one mechanism is due to a

232
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,680
multitude of mechanisms and it that

233
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,440
sadly that means that just profiling one

234
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,839
gene or or one part of the genome is not

235
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,839
going to tell us whether there is

236
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,720
resistance or not we need to look

237
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,600
everywhere uh to to identify or

238
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,160
understand drug resistance and that

239
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,560
that's uh also a necessity of of um

240
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,839
employing larger and larger data sets

241
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,680
methods that are going to maximize our

242
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,880
chances of of understanding uh drug

243
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:06,839
response drug uh U uh or or targets uh

244
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,079
are are most likely to be helpful that

245
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,519
use the methods that use both genomics

246
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,440
transcriptomics pathology images other

247
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,560
kinds of clinical information so using

248
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,440
as much information as possible is going

249
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,920
to teach us more about what's happening

250
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,680
in the disease and and which patients we

251
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,200
we want to identify and finally of

252
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,079
course machine learning is highly suited

253
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,440
for these kinds of all these kinds of

254
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:34,120
questions so with that jumping into the

255
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,240
the first uh principle of what I want to

256
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,320
talk about how do we use machine

257
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,000
learning to establish a robust data set

258
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,279
to enable R&D and by that I mean

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,360
identifying better targets

260
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,320
identifying

261
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,480
uh uh cancer drivers and identifying

262
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,440
patients

263
00:11:51,480 --> 00:12:00,040
so 10 years ago this paper was published

264
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,880
uh here at the broad actually uh and

265
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,320
made uh certain predictions about what

266
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,519
kind of data are necessary to better

267
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,480
understand multiple kinds of cancers uh

268
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,800
down to the percentage of uh uh you know

269
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:21,079
down to three to 1% of prevalence of

270
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,279
certain mutation and so what it did is

271
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,959
uh depending on the the mutation

272
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,079
frequency across a a variety of cancers

273
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,279
that are depicted at the bottom it made

274
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,480
predictions of how how many of these

275
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,760
cancers need to be sequenced in order to

276
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,320
identify a mutation with a prevalence of

277
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:43,079
10 5 three two and one 1% and as you can

278
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,360
read on the this y AIS this is these are

279
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,040
staggering numbers they were completely

280
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,079
improbable numbers 10 years ago because

281
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,240
by that time uh we were uh or a lot of

282
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,720
people were in the middle of of the the

283
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,920
analysis of already a very large project

284
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,199
for cancer sequencing the cancer genom

285
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,320
Atlas or tcga and the the the number of

286
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:08,519
cancers that were sequenced in the tcga

287
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,240
was Al together between 10 and 15

288
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,279
thousands across all of these cancers

289
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,440
and so thinking that we would need one

290
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,800
day several thousands of to see we would

291
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
need one day to sequence several

292
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,920
thousands of samples for one particular

293
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,720
cancer was was uh not not imaginable at

294
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,880
the time of course we knew that with the

295
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,920
progress of of SE quencing that would

296
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,959
come one

297
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,959
day and that's now we're now at the CP

298
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:41,839
of achieving that scale to understand uh

299
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,279
and discover new cancer variants um

300
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,120
because we're starting to have the

301
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:51,120
numbers of course there's a one

302
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:55,759
important uh aspect here which is that

303
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,839
we need to uh focus on somatic mutations

304
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,759
somatic mutations are those mutations

305
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,519
that occur specifically in the in the

306
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,199
tumor and and that that are not

307
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:09,639
polymorphisms meaning that they don't

308
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:12,759
they're not part of our normal U genome

309
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,800
so sematic mutations they they can be

310
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,720
discovered when we're comparing a tumor

311
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,000
genome with a normal genome but in the

312
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,199
course of the data that we generate at

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,560
Caris we're only sequencing the tumor

314
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,839
and that's for for multiple reasons one

315
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,160
is for cost reasons it would cost twice

316
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,160
more to to sequence both the normal

317
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,160
genome and the tumor genome but also

318
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,160
because logistically it's much more

319
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,600
complicated to deal with with two kinds

320
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,320
of samples one liquid sample from from

321
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,560
blood and one uh sample from one one

322
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,360
solid sample from the the the solid

323
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,759
tumor of course it's possible to to to

324
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,199
sequence both tumor and normal but it's

325
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,279
it's more costly and impr practical so

326
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,920
then we're left with a question which is

327
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,800
how do we constitute a data set for

328
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,639
discovery that

329
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,480
uh is purely composed of sematic

330
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,560
mutations so the first quick example I

331
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,639
want to talk about is is a a technique

332
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,880
that we devised that we called Som alone

333
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,839
to identify the somatic mutations in uh

334
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,680
in tumor so tumor it's tumor only

335
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,920
sematic germline

336
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,839
classification um we the goal was to

337
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,759
apply it to the collection of a half

338
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,199
million cancer cases that we have that

339
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm going to talk more in a couple of

340
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:33,680
slides uh but we used to to to devise

341
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,680
and train this method we we used a a

342
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,600
smaller data set of matched t uh uh

343
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,440
cancer tissue and normal blood

344
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,480
sequencing of a size of about 300

345
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,959
samples and that gave us the ground

346
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,079
truth of what sematic mutations versus

347
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,720
germine uh look like uh and long story

348
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,639
short this algorithm is using uh two

349
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,160
main source of of information one the

350
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:02,079
frequency of Norm of polymorphisms the

351
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,360
normal human population and the little

352
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,519
fraction of those mutations in the tumor

353
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,759
that was that was sequenced so in in all

354
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,319
our cells there's multiple polymorphisms

355
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,720
about one per thousand bases uh and in

356
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:18,360
case of heterozygous germine mutations

357
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,560
they're present in about 50% a little

358
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,199
fraction so the the polymorphism is

359
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,560
about half the reads in the in the

360
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,519
sequencing data and that's in all our

361
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,959
cells and in tumors there's or in tumor

362
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,440
samples there's a a mixture of both

363
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,480
normal cells and and and and tumor cells

364
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,600
normal cells are the the blood blood

365
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,920
vessels and fibroblasts and uh and

366
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,360
immune cells or infiltrate the the the

367
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,000
tumor so there's always a mixture of

368
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,839
normal cells and cancer cells in the

369
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,800
cancer sample that we're sequencing

370
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,199
which actually works to our advantage uh

371
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,600
because when then we we look at the

372
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,360
mutations that are present in cancer

373
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,560
cells they're going to come at an AIC

374
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,160
fraction or a be a little frequency that

375
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,039
is lower than that of the the normal

376
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,520
cells so we're going to use that kind of

377
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,679
information to uh potentially uh um

378
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,039
detect which which mutations come from

379
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,799
the tumor and which come from the normal

380
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:20,360
cells and so to illustrate this um what

381
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,919
what I'm depicting here is chromosome

382
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,039
one so so these are the genomic

383
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,360
coordinates of one chromosome on the the

384
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,240
x-axis and on the y axis are all the

385
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,400
mutations that we can find in the tumor

386
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,200
sample

387
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,120
so all the dots are are the mutation

388
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,880
with their be frequency meaning like how

389
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,799
how frequent is that mutation in the

390
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,760
sequencing data uh and that's for one of

391
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,200
the samples that was in the ground truth

392
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,760
data set so so there's match normal

393
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,440
which allows us to identify which of

394
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,400
these mutations are semetic in red

395
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,360
because they're not present in Blood and

396
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,640
which ones are a germ line in Gray

397
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,200
because they are present in Blood and

398
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,080
the the principle that I just uh uh

399
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,200
talked about one slide ago that tumor

400
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,840
mutations are going to be preferentially

401
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,559
at a lower BL frequency than the the

402
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,080
germline mutations is generally true the

403
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,480
the the red dots are are most of the

404
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,200
time lower than the the the gray dots

405
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,000
and that's that's information it's it's

406
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,960
imperfect and incomplete but it already

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,760
gives us uh information so when we uh

408
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,039
make a model to use that kind of

409
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,480
information to predict whether the the

410
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,440
mutations are

411
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,840
germine or sematic there is a a

412
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,960
relatively poor performance of of uh in

413
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,080
that exercise which is which is expected

414
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,919
but it's still important so

415
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:45,080
second uh there are actually really

416
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,720
really good databases of germline events

417
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,640
uh that that exist and and one is Nomad

418
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:55,039
that's also a project from the from the

419
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:58,480
broad and multiple other um centers that

420
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,080
cataloges all the the that that attempts

421
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,960
to catalog all all the the polymorphisms

422
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,360
in the human population for that they're

423
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,480
using a data set of

424
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,039
800,000 uh exomes and genomes and look

425
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,840
at the the frequency of every single um

426
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,679
every single

427
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,799
um mutation in that data set and and uh

428
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,919
um that allows to make this this

429
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,480
database of of polymorphisms together

430
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,960
with their frequencies and that's

431
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,960
extremely useful for for research so

432
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,120
using that we we can uh compare all the

433
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,760
events that we find in tumors with with

434
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,559
that database of of uh of Journal

435
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,520
mutations and and estimate based on the

436
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,400
frequency in the population whether

437
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,919
that's going to be likely a germine

438
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,159
event meaning present in normal cells or

439
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,559
a sematic event and and if if if

440
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,919
mutations are are frequent in in the the

441
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,840
population and we find it in tumor it's

442
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,200
likely germline uh if they are not

443
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,360
present in tumors sorry in the general

444
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,760
population or at a very low frequency

445
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,520
it's likely sematic so that's a second

446
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,559
source of information that we can use

447
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,600
and and that gives us better uh better

448
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,320
performance in predicting from tumor

449
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,919
alone whether we have a German or

450
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,159
sematic event uh but still still not

451
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,919
perfect and combining both uh we can

452
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,760
achieve better um uh uh better

453
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:27,000
performance in predicting whether we

454
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,960
have sematic or or or germline events uh

455
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,159
and it can actually get really either a

456
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,559
good Precision or a good recall and and

457
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,320
uh what this allows us to do then go

458
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:39,919
back to the entirety of a half million

459
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,400
exomes from tumor only and sort all the

460
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,240
mutations and focus precisely on on

461
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,039
sematic events so why is that important

462
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,480
it's important because then we can go

463
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,720
back to the question that was that was

464
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,720
uh identified 10 years ago of of how

465
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,200
many samples are needed to identify

466
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,919
driver mutations in a series of of

467
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,080
cancers depending on their mutation

468
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,679
frequency and now we have the numbers

469
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,600
and we have the sematic mutations in

470
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,120
those those tumors and these are numbers

471
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,320
from the the uh collection of of of data

472
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,640
that we have assembled or assembled or

473
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,640
are assembling at at Caris through

474
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,000
diagnostic testing and there's 12,000

475
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,880
melanomas more than 70,000 lung cancers

476
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,039
and were like well into the numbers of

477
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,400
tumors that are needed to

478
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,039
uh better understand those U those those

479
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,840
those tumor types and and uh now focus

480
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,159
on um identifying new cancer

481
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,120
drivers uh and that's work that is

482
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:44,000
happening right now so so so I don't

483
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,840
have the second part of this story but

484
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,279
at least we uh we we are able to analyze

485
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,039
those data of an extremely large scale

486
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:55,320
to constitute better data sets for for

487
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,679
R&D and Drug Discovery so next I want to

488
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,200
talk about the second aspect of of the

489
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,360
use of of machine learning or or

490
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,679
actually there's there's not a ton of

491
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,200
machine learning in that that short

492
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:06,840
section but it's really perfecting the

493
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,559
data set that is going to be used for

494
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,240
for R&D uh in this example I want to

495
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,640
talk about an effort from uh last month

496
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,000
actually where we reprocessed close to

497
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,559
400,000 RNA samples so like I described

498
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,559
at the beginning for for every single

499
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,760
tissue sample that that comes through

500
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,559
the door at U at Caris we're generating

501
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,240
a whole exom sequencing and a whole

502
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:33,320
transcriptome sequencing and and also a

503
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:38,400
lot of U IHC uh and H so a lot of

504
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:41,480
digital pathology images and to uh to we

505
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,080
needed to uh uh go back to the entire

506
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,480
data set for RNA to to improve certain

507
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,520
aspects for the for the for the purpose

508
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,480
of R&D and went back to Raw data and

509
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,600
reprocessed 400,000 samples in a matter

510
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,880
of a couple days and that was really a

511
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:01,120
notable effort um that was a a both

512
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,080
scientific and also engineering feed to

513
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,480
to to generate that amount of data in

514
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,919
such a short time and for those who are

515
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,840
interested in the the the stack employed

516
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,000
here I'm writing it here but basically

517
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,760
in AWS we build up an infrastructure to

518
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,400
to uh deal with that amount of data and

519
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,320
it's important to to do so and go back

520
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,880
to to Raw data

521
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,120
because in a diagnostic test there's

522
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,080
Evolutions every day of of how we can uh

523
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,080
improve improve the the the workflows

524
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,000
how we can generate better data and so

525
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,799
year after year the data change a little

526
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,679
bit morph a little bit and and uh when

527
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,039
we want to go back to all the data we

528
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,000
need to take steps to to harmonize and

529
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,279
make sure that we we don't have these

530
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,080
effects and and drifts in the data so

531
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,080
that they can be uh

532
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,760
analyzable and uh the the the the the

533
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,000
advantage of that is maybe to go back to

534
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,360
one of P that's point at the in the

535
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,400
intro what is needed for for ML is data

536
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,880
and the data is there it it needs to be

537
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,320
put in a in a shape and a form where

538
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,840
that is usable then for for drug

539
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,440
Discovery and the kinds of analyses and

540
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,559
and machine learning want to do with

541
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,440
those um so briefly uh the RNA data

542
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,400
generate expression data so the

543
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,240
expression of all the the genes in the

544
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,440
genome those expression data can be used

545
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,960
to compare various tumor types and and

546
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,320
there's a lot that can be done with

547
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,520
those that's also um uh something that

548
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,640
is that is starting back in the days of

549
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,840
tcga we were using 10,000 samples uh

550
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,880
across 10 to 15,000 samples across all

551
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,600
tumor types here there's close to

552
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,600
400,000 there's there's even more in the

553
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,760
collection uh this can be represented so

554
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
all these transcriptomes meaning gene

555
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,760
expression can be represented in this

556
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,520
this Disney plot which is typical for

557
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,279
folks who work with single cell data uh

558
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,399
with single cell data It's Not Unusual

559
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,240
to see a quarter million and half

560
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:06,799
million or a million cells across a few

561
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,159
samples here we're not talking about

562
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,960
cells each dot is one sample and there's

563
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,919
there's a close to 400,000 samples

564
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:19,200
depicted here across variety of of solid

565
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:21,840
tumor types uh very as we would expect

566
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,600
sample types the samples cluster by by

567
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,919
cancer type due to the expression

568
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,080
differences between uh between these uh

569
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,320
these samples uh

570
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,799
I forgot to do so earlier but there this

571
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,000
this work and then the previous work

572
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,520
that I showed on some alone is the the

573
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,480
work of multiple members of the team uh

574
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,440
NOP Laura Richards mukun Varma Christian

575
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,039
fresh Greg Demaris Brady Gil and and and

576
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,919
others in the data science

577
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,600
team um I'm I'm only going to to uh

578
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,200
barely scratch the surface of what can

579
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,120
be done with these kinds of expression

580
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,240
data here but I want to give an idea of

581
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
of why that's important for drug

582
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,880
Discovery and what kind of features we

583
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,880
can

584
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,039
distinguish in in those kinds of

585
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,600
expression data so here's colorl cancer

586
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,919
um there's close to 50,000 coloral

587
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,640
cancers in in this data set that are

588
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,159
that uh uh are depicted here in Brown in

589
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,799
this this Disney plot and uh we can

590
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,360
start distinguishing some features that

591
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:27,320
tell us about the biology of of those

592
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,440
those uh cancer samples so so everything

593
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,039
in brown here is called actal cancer

594
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,360
including this little island here and

595
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,600
this little island there and when we

596
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,480
color the data set now by where the

597
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,960
specimen was was U uh sampled so where

598
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,240
it was coming from in the body so either

599
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,039
the liver in the case of a liver

600
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,960
metastasis or the lung in the case of a

601
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:53,880
lung metastasis we can see that those

602
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,679
those uh this has the the site of the

603
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,640
the the biopsy has an influence on the

604
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,159
transcriptome of those Cancers and so

605
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,840
that's why they they belong to this

606
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,039
slightly different islands in the in

607
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,120
this Disney plot so anyway that's that's

608
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:10,320
really just the surface of of those data

609
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,200
as as you saw saw this uh this massive

610
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,200
data set was just generated last month

611
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,960
and so this is very new but now

612
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,039
constitutes the kind of data set that

613
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,480
can be used for R&D both for uh both

614
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:26,360
from from mutations but also transcript

615
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,080
home data and uh and and we we need to

616
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,039
dive in not just us but Al partners of

617
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,200
of Caris that are working on this

618
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,960
data so next I want to talk about the

619
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,200
application of machine learning to

620
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,279
improve treatment decisions uh that's

621
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,080
one where we we as I said we need to do

622
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,360
better with signatures we need to do

623
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,480
better identifying patients and

624
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,600
identifying their their uh the the

625
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,120
disease

626
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,080
characteristics that are going to train

627
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,919
guide treatment decisions and for that

628
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:04,480
I'm going to focus on on this uh aspect

629
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:07,799
of the diagnostic test that is um um

630
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,960
available to patients who who are uh uh

631
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,519
profiled at Caris where we can use the

632
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,240
variety of data that are generated

633
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,159
through the diagnostic test so the whole

634
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,039
exome sequencing the the transcriptome

635
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,960
sequencing in the IHC U through through

636
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:25,440
a model that identifies the exact tumor

637
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,960
type uh of of the the uh of the tumor

638
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,440
that was that was um profiled and that's

639
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,399
where work from Anthony Hemstead and and

640
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:39,240
Hass ghani in the and the in the team

641
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:41,640
so the purpose of this mainly is to

642
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,600
identify the primary tumor for the case

643
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,440
of cancers of unknown primary which are

644
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,519
a kind of cancer where the

645
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,120
doctor the doctors cannot identify which

646
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:57,039
cancer type they are dealing with and

647
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,039
it's very important because the the the

648
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,600
outcome for cancers of a non primary is

649
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:06,039
very poor about a year less than a year

650
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,760
because the doctors cannot determine

651
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,000
which drugs would be best suited for

652
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,360
treating that

653
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,840
cancer uh so they revert to sequencing

654
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,360
to learn more about the cancer uh which

655
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,679
can tell what kind of mutations exist in

656
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,480
those tumors but mutations alone does do

657
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:27,000
not drive treatment decisions yet it's

658
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,120
PR important to to under understand what

659
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,640
kind of disease we with so that they can

660
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,919
follow standard of care and for that

661
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,760
reason identifying or being able to

662
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,240
identify the the the the primary origin

663
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,000
of these these cancers is very important

664
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,919
and that's the goal of this this GPS

665
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,880
Test that's performing the data

666
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:48,120
generated uh very briefly it's multiple

667
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,880
models that are using the the whole exom

668
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:55,120
data that go down the tree here and and

669
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,039
classify every time which which branch

670
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,080
of the tree to to go through and go

671
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,960
through additional levels of uh of um

672
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,919
granularity through the the the enor Tre

673
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,000
uh at the end there's a prediction for

674
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:12,039
which cancer type out of 90 cancer types

675
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,840
can be uh uh is is predicted to

676
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:18,720
be uh that the cancer of origin has been

677
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,880
trained on uh about half of the

678
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,760
available data at Caris and then tested

679
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,519
on on more cancers of unknown primary

680
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,360
and uh and and and with known primary

681
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:32,279
origin and validate on prospective cases

682
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,679
and and that's the aspect of validation

683
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,039
just as a brief aside validation of

684
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,039
diagnostic testing is an extremely

685
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,799
complicated task where the the bar is

686
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,760
extremely high to to submit those kinds

687
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,279
of U of uh of of of tests and

688
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,519
performances to to the FDA so that

689
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,799
there's really the certainty that the

690
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,120
results can be actionable by the by the

691
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,799
doctors and the the by by by by

692
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,600
physicians so every time we're talking

693
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,320
about these kinds of prediction

694
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,679
and machine learning or not uh from from

695
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,200
uh diagnostic data we also have to

696
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,799
understand that there's there's a very

697
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,399
very high burden of proof of can that be

698
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,880
applied to to a patient would would I

699
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,159
use that test and Trust the result for

700
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,919
for for for my

701
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,799
patient

702
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,799
uh to close the the the loop a little

703
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:31,399
bit and uh this test test has been

704
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,559
applied to the tcga data that I talked

705
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:37,080
about earlier so like I said there there

706
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:41,519
was a this here only 8,000 of the the 10

707
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,519
to 15,000 tumors in tcga but uh we could

708
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,080
validate it with a very high performance

709
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:51,279
on this those dcga data which of course

710
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:53,559
have known uh tumors of origin but with

711
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,840
with masking the the the tumor of origin

712
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,240
and applying GPS onto this data we could

713
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,600
we could repr predict what the the tumor

714
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,360
types were and that was a very good

715
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,799
validation of the the performance of

716
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,760
that test and robustness to the source

717
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,519
of of the data which is really

718
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,720
important uh it's very robust to to the

719
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,440
SES of metastasis as we discussed the

720
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,960
transcripton data is going to be

721
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,120
slightly different whether we have a

722
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,679
primary tumor or a metastasis depending

723
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,159
on which organ so those are aspects that

724
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,120
are going to be really important when uh

725
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,240
when when applying this this test so

726
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,799
that we're we're making false false

727
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,720
calls but it's robust to that so with

728
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,080
that I want to give a a brief patient

729
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,440
highlight because this was really

730
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,760
notable and and we actually have many

731
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,399
many many examples of how that kind of

732
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,480
of test applied to cancers of unknown

733
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:48,960
primary is really helping treating uh uh

734
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,320
patients so in this instance I'm talking

735
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,720
about a a male specimen submitted as a

736
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,399
renal cell carcinoma so like cancer in

737
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,399
the kidney arising in a transplanted

738
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:02,240
kidney

739
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,720
and so first uh first uh thought is

740
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,720
probably kidney cancer but GPS favored

741
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,559
the gynecological origin with 99%

742
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,679
probability and and uh histology of

743
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,880
serus carcinoma which of course is a

744
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,039
female cancer but uh uh so that raised

745
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,919
questions from from the beginning when

746
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,760
comparing the snip profile of the tumor

747
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,120
and that of the benign kidney around the

748
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,480
tumor uh it showed that there was a

749
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,880
negligible chromosome y copy number

750
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,840
which raised additional questions but

751
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,840
also that the the tumor matched the

752
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,000
transplanted transplanted kidney and in

753
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,519
fact uh of course you guessed but this

754
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,440
this was not Rosell carcinoma this was a

755
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:50,080
a um uh ovarian cancer that was already

756
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,159
present in the transplanted kidney at

757
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,480
the time of the the transplant and the

758
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,880
oncologist was was uh updated and

759
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,000
oncologist was was made aware and they

760
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,679
updated the therapy accordingly and and

761
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,200
that led to much better treatment for

762
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,960
that person which otherwise would have

763
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,359
been treated for for kidney cancer and

764
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,879
probably would have not received the

765
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,639
right treatment that's the kind of

766
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,159
treatment decisions that can be informed

767
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,679
by the use ML on this this diagnostic

768
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,000
data so next I want to talk about the

769
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,520
use of ml for predicting biomarkers and

770
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,520
and patient

771
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,800
outcomes um

772
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,480
and that's where we're going to go in a

773
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,839
slightly different direction here with

774
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,359
using the digital pathology data at at

775
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,359
Caris so there's two kinds of pathology

776
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,320
data that we're generating for every

777
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,800
single case that comes through the door

778
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,960
one is h& so hemox and eosin and the

779
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,119
other one is uh IHC so

780
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,520
imunohistochemistry where we're staining

781
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,720
the slides for a particular protein that

782
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,240
uh binds an

783
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,400
antibody this is used to confirm

784
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,440
diagnosis so uh the the the Pathologists

785
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,599
are are looking at these slides and

786
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,960
identifying the the shape of the cells

787
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,000
and the histology to confirm that we're

788
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,400
deal in in fact dealing with the the

789
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,400
cancer type that we that we thought it's

790
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,760
also used to determine the percentum or

791
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,920
nuclei so the the purity of the sample

792
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,440
and and where the tumor areas in the

793
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,720
slide are because we're micro dissecting

794
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,480
every single uh sample that need needs

795
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,760
to before

796
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,720
sequencing what that means is when when

797
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,880
when sequencing samples they first the

798
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,599
the block the ffp block so the paraffin

799
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,520
embedded block of the tissue is scut in

800
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,400
thin slides those are put on a

801
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,480
microscopic slide a pathologist is

802
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,760
looking at the tumor identifying where

803
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,359
most of the the tumor cells are and then

804
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,520
micro dissecting that area to go to the

805
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,880
the sequencing essay and what what this

806
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,200
U the consequence of that is that it

807
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,280
creates much better data for Diagnostic

808
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,839
because we're not sequencing a bunch of

809
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,960
normal cells we're focusing the

810
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:08,720
sequencing on the tumor cells when

811
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,839
needed if the tumor is already pure it

812
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,960
just goes straight to to sequencing so

813
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,040
that's great for Diagnostic but it's

814
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,920
also great because these images are all

815
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,400
digitized and there's a ton of

816
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,200
information in them that we can use

817
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,720
machine learning to to to leverage very

818
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,119
briefly uh as I said all the images are

819
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,119
digitized and so so that's use of robots

820
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,119
that are picking the slides putting them

821
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,119
in the scanner that's all uploaded to to

822
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,319
cloud and various uh various tools that

823
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,800
allow the Pathologists to to look at

824
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:43,560
them uh there's automated scanning and

825
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,280
everything so so so that's there's

826
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,599
really a massive scale here as you

827
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,079
remember there's more than 15 between 15

828
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,240
and 20,000 tumors per month that are

829
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:58,240
going through the labs all this data go

830
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,040
to uh uh uh the the the our cloud

831
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,880
storage and and can then be used for

832
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,319
various efforts uh of course at the

833
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,880
beginning we go we need to go from a a

834
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:11,440
scanned image that contains some labels

835
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,720
some pen marks some some that has

836
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,880
various sizes and and and and shapes and

837
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,240
and everything and detect all the the

838
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,079
areas that we would want to focus on in

839
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,480
a in a computational fashion so where's

840
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,640
the foreground which areas are in Focus

841
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,319
or out of focus are there artifacts are

842
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,200
there labels we need to to remove and

843
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:32,319
and finally uh dealing with the the the

844
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,160
the images that's going to be

845
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:38,520
interesting for our data There is close

846
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,800
to 4 million images uh both from uh h&

847
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,440
and IHC that represent 350,000 cases and

848
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,160
and we're digitizing everything that

849
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,599
comes through the door today but there's

850
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,920
millions and millions of images that are

851
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,680
uh that have not been images in years

852
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,000
that have not been digitized in years

853
00:37:52,680 --> 00:38:00,000
prior that are also being digitized so

854
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,079
this is a growing a set a massive scale

855
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,520
already so like I said there's a ton of

856
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,839
information in these

857
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,240
images uh here two examples of breast

858
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,720
cancer one uh with the cdh1

859
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,319
mutation uh and the other one with a

860
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,280
fusion Gene so so a translocation that

861
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:21,480
leads to the overe expression of this

862
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,119
this uh Gene and track and they look

863
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,000
massively different and that's that's

864
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,599
obvious to the to the eye that's obvious

865
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,880
to a pathologist but in some instances

866
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,480
is the differences are not obvious to

867
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,720
anyone and and neither the untrained or

868
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,319
the trained eye and that's where we want

869
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,560
to use computer vision to help us make

870
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,079
those distinctions uh we can employ a

871
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,119
bunch of models I'm going to give two

872
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,040
examples all for the purpose of uh

873
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,800
modeling modeling tumor types or drug

874
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:55,160
response or or various aspects of tumor

875
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:58,079
biology so first use case uh let's say

876
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,720
we we have a a clinical iCal trial

877
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,319
against U for kise inhibitor Ross one

878
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,560
against Ross one and you want to

879
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:08,599
identify a 100 patients that have a

880
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,839
fusion in this Ross one gene the problem

881
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:14,319
here is that the prevalence of that

882
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:18,359
Fusion is about 1% of lung cancer and if

883
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:21,200
we want to recruit those patients uh and

884
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,839
identify uh those that Harbor that that

885
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,839
Fusion we need to sequence the genomes

886
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:30,040
uh of 100 patients to find one and so if

887
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,440
we want to identify 100 patients we need

888
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:36,440
to sequence 10,000 and that has a St

889
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:38,960
staggering cost um if it's several th000

890
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,160
uh dollars to sequence one sample you

891
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,240
can imagine the cost of sequencing a 100

892
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:50,000
so how can we use uh ml

893
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,119
to uh train a model that

894
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,440
enriches the the the cohort so that we

895
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,760
don't have to sequence so many so that's

896
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,720
what we did uh we we um briefly used a

897
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,480
CNN to train a model on a lot of our

898
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,040
data uh to identify these Ross One cases

899
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,960
and here you can see that the enrichment

900
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,720
that we're able to to achieve so so uh

901
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,720
then running it on unseen cases if we

902
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,160
instead of naively sequencing 10,000 if

903
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,560
we run the model on on

904
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,440
25,000 h& slides we can identify a short

905
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,640
list of a thousand cases to sequence

906
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,280
already a decrease in 10,000 uh a

907
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:33,240
tenfold decrease in the in the cost of

908
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,960
the the sequencing and further if we run

909
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,880
it on 30,000 h& cases we only see need

910
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,160
to sequence 300 cases to find 100 that

911
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,319
would be enrolled in the in the trial

912
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,400
and so it's that kind of of uh machine

913
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:49,400
learning that can help drug Discovery

914
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,920
because it's going to help the clinical

915
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,480
trials for a particular drug and uh and

916
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,599
definitely benefit the the the patients

917
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,240
that's work by Tommy Boucher mukun

918
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,319
varman Ming Chang and others in the in

919
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,880
the

920
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,079
team uh briefly because I think I'm

921
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,119
close on

922
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:14,440
time okay a couple more minutes the the

923
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,359
um some learnings we need to account for

924
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:20,760
the various sizes of the the the data

925
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,040
and its hogin there's class imbalance so

926
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,319
we need to account for that when we're

927
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,800
training the data like Ross one fusions

928
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,079
were 1% of 1% prevalence so it's really

929
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,359
hard to train data at 1% prevalence we

930
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,119
need to to take that into account uh and

931
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:40,200
and then make sure we're not overfitting

932
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,319
and uh then um uh we're dealing with

933
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,119
data that have multiple resolutions so

934
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,359
so like a microscope we can either uh

935
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,040
look like a large field of view or or

936
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,880
very narrow and we can actually employ

937
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,440
multiple magnifications at the same time

938
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,200
to train better models to see the

939
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,480
overall structure or really the the

940
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,319
cellular structure the next the next uh

941
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,400
example which I will it's it's several

942
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:06,240
slides but I'm going to to abstract uh

943
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,680
abstract from it so we we wanted to

944
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,599
provide a an alter we're working on

945
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,960
providing an alternative to the the test

946
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,560
I talked at the beginning on type DX

947
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,079
which is an rtpcr test based on roughly

948
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:21,640
20 genes gene expression uh that's

949
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,040
that's uh that's cost due to generate

950
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:27,240
and and uh given all the data that exist

951
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,599
today we can probably do better and to

952
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,400
decrease the cost one aspect of doing

953
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,440
better is to start from uh h& slides so

954
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,640
digital pathology slides instead of

955
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,280
expression data for that we're using

956
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:44,839
data from a clinical trial where uh

957
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,599
simply put there was um a breast cancer

958
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:49,640
diagnosis Then followed by five years of

959
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,680
treatment with a of treatment with

960
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,440
endocrine therapy and at the end of the

961
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,599
5 years some patients were put on a

962
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,680
placebo and some other patients were put

963
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,359
on additional endocrine therapy for five

964
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,040
more years and then there's a readout

965
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,280
for the the the for for for 10 years so

966
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,800
really we're looking at 15 years from

967
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,760
diagnostic to the end of the the the

968
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,040
followup and we're going to use data

969
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,240
from day Zero so at the time of

970
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,880
diagnosis to predict whether there's

971
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,520
going to be recurrence 10 to 15 years

972
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,319
down the line and whether those patients

973
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,880
would benefit or not from additional

974
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:32,760
treatment with the endocrine

975
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,079
therapy uh computer vision model we're

976
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,200
extracting features from from the slide

977
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,839
cut into two tiles uh like so so number

978
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,040
of features using a Transformer

979
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,280
predicting a score whether there's high

980
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,280
risk of recurrence or low risk of

981
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,319
recurrence and it works so like between

982
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,040
the predicted low risk and high risk we

983
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:55,160
can see that there's a a large

984
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,839
difference in this the survival curve uh

985
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,000
when looking at at all patients so I'm

986
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:01,520
not even focusing on whether they used

987
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,960
additional endocrine therapy or no

988
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,480
that's done from the images only so no

989
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,880
other information or incorporating some

990
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,040
of the clinical data into the model such

991
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,680
as type of the tumor whether they

992
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,839
received surgery and other things like

993
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,040
this now where this becomes interesting

994
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:22,960
is where where we look at where we bend

995
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,960
the data uh whether the the sample the

996
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,559
the patients received additional

997
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,720
endocrine therapy uh or received Placebo

998
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,280
and in the low risk group very very low

999
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,000
risk of recurrence in the high risk

1000
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,800
group we see a difference between

1001
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,240
between those two groups but what this

1002
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,319
tells us is that these patients here

1003
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,960
probably don't need to be treated it

1004
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,720
doesn't provide an advantage and that's

1005
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,359
a very very important information to not

1006
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,839
overtreat patients this can be compared

1007
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,599
to the the results of uh the these other

1008
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,599
T tests so so another test that that

1009
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:58,599
does the same is the breast cancer index

1010
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,040
um where where achieving very good if

1011
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,760
not better performance and that's really

1012
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,480
the basis of proposing better diagnostic

1013
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,079
cheaper diagnostic with modern

1014
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,720
techniques and that are going to help

1015
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,000
patients so with that I would like to

1016
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,660
thank you all for your attention and

1017
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,120
take any

1018
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,120
[Applause]

1019
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,480
questions we are a little overtime but I

1020
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,480
would be happy to take at Le one

1021
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,480
question for Nicholas

1022
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,880
if no question from the audience I have

1023
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:38,720
one question for un nio

1024
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,520
um as as you have been working in this

1025
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,760
field of data science and in cancer you

1026
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,359
you talked about rnac data pathology

1027
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,119
data what would be one data type that

1028
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:51,559
you wish we had more and need to produce

1029
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,960
more which will help developing machine

1030
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:57,480
learning proteomics large scale

1031
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,359
proteomics that's very very important uh

1032
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,559
right to today it's really hard to

1033
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,800
generate large scale data for the

1034
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:06,040
expression of a variety of of proteins

1035
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,400
there are techniques that exist based on

1036
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,520
on antibodies that can Multiplex the

1037
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,040
detection of say 5,000 proteins it's

1038
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,640
very costly it's not high throughput but

1039
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,079
there's so much more that we can learn

1040
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,079
from promic uh than than we do today and

1041
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,960
especially large scale promic and that

1042
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:26,400
goes beyond cancer so with cancer most

1043
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,559
of the aberration are are based in DNA

1044
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,680
cancer is the disease of the DNA uh

1045
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,720
there so we can detect mutations and and

1046
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,839
other kinds of events that occur in in

1047
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,760
DNA mutations epigenetic modifications

1048
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:41,920
Etc all of that occurs in DNA we can see

1049
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,040
that with sequencing uh both DNA

1050
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,680
sequencing and RNA sequencing but we

1051
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,160
don't have a ton of information on

1052
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,839
proteins and in cancer this is going to

1053
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,920
help but it's also going to help in

1054
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,960
other

1055
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,200
diseases great please go ahead I really

1056
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,000
liked your question actually but my

1057
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,760
question was in the case um cases where

1058
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,200
the GPS AI model is not correct what are

1059
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,200
the things that are driving the

1060
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,440
misclassifications oh that's that's

1061
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:14,920
that's that's hard uh what's driving the

1062
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,920
M classifications is so sometimes the

1063
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,599
the the quality of the data so when

1064
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,280
we're dealing with extremely small

1065
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,319
tumors uh there's there's so much so

1066
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,359
little material that it's that it's hard

1067
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,480
to to generate sufficient sequencing

1068
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,480
data to to generate

1069
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,359
uh the the proper calls so so some of

1070
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,640
those misclassifications we actually

1071
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,240
know from the beginning that sadly

1072
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,480
there's there's there's not enough

1073
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,559
there's also some um uh some some of the

1074
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,079
misclassifications in the cases where we

1075
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,839
have mixtures of multiple cell types due

1076
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,559
to the location of the tumor so I showed

1077
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,040
some of the confusion that could exist

1078
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:52,359
for for primary samples that are that

1079
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,319
that have metastasized to another organ

1080
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:56,079
that can generate some some confusion so

1081
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,559
that could be that could be some of the

1082
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,319
the misclassification a thank you all

1083
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,079
right so we'll take a short break now

1084
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:05,710
but do come back at 11: for our next

1085
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,820
talk

1086
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,820
[Applause]
