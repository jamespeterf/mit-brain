00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,359
Hello and good afternoon everybody. My

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,120
name is Trisha Dingle. I'm the

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,040
engagements and partnership manager with

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
MIT Startup Exchange and it's my

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,679
pleasure to introduce today's MIT

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,080
startup lightning talks. So you will be

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
hearing from four companies. Many of you

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,400
have already experienced that each of

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,720
the presenting startups have established

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,400
as a designated high-top table outside

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,439
during the networking breaks and

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,679
immediately following during the

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
networking lunch. All four of the

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
presenting startups are part of MIT

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,760
Startup Exchange and they're developing

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,079
critical technologies and services that

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,040
align with the focus areas for today's

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,800
events. Novel drug delivery, uh AI and

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,200
machine learning for biomolelecular

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,680
modeling, biio manufacturing, precision

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,280
medicine, and advanced diagnostics. So

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,120
with this selection of startups, we

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
really want to give you an idea of the

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,600
technologies emerging from MIT that are

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,199
advancing health science. They're going

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
to speak to some of the use cases that

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,239
they've been working on with partners

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
and customers. So, I encourage all of

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,440
you to meet throughout the day, talk

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
during the networking to discuss

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,920
potential joint opportunities because

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,720
that's what we do at MIT Startup

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
Exchange. We help startups identify and

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,560
experience collaborations and

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,280
partnerships with industry, bringing

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,280
together MIT connected startups, ILP

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
corporate members to foster these

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,720
collaborations and partnerships between

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
them.

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,840
The startups that we support, they all

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
have a strong connection to the

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,280
institute. This connection can come

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,720
through the team, the founding team, the

44
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,040
technology, but in other cases, startups

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,799
that don't have an origin at MIT, uh

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
they'll they'll be vetted and supported

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,200
by our MIT peers, and we welcome them

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,759
into Startup Exchange. So, examples of

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,079
MIT peers would be CEL Connect Plus,

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,640
Start.no, Nano and the engine, many of

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,079
which I'm sure uh you've heard of and if

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,520
not, we're happy to give you more

53
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,320
information about those

54
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,280
programs. We do work with uh hundreds of

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,240
startups virtually in any sector. We

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,719
also have geographic uh agnost uh we're

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,880
agnostic in terms of ge geography

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,440
working with MIT connected startups that

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,000
are headquartered all over the world.

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,000
But everything we do is to expose and

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
connect startups and industry and we do

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,720
this in a highly curated way and also

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
can provide learning opportunities to

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,760
both parties. So examples of how we

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360
build these connections foster these

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
introductions. We launch calls for

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,840
startups based on corporate's own

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,239
challenges or initiatives or priorities.

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,120
We facilitate those one-on-one meetings

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,519
between both parties. Um we host virtual

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
demo days and other events. And in terms

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,560
of those learning opportunities, that's

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,120
again where we have the opportunity to

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,680
co-organize them with our MIT pairs. So,

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,200
uh, peers such as Martin Trust Center,

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,599
uh, E14, VMS or the Venture M, uh,

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
mentoring

78
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,200
service. This is a small, very small

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,120
sample of the success cases that we've

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,879
had to date. Um, they include proofs of

81
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,680
concept, pilots, uh, joint development

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,319
and acquisitions. So it's really the

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,239
intent for every event, every meeting,

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,720
every introduction to produce that

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
valuable connection for both parties

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,040
that are ultimately going to lead to

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,840
their own success case. So if you have

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,159
any questions or want more information

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,560
about how we're working with the ILP

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
members and the ILP program to make sure

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
that you do have these opportunities to

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
engage with startups and new

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
technologies, uh find one of our team

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,519
members, your program manager, and we're

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,239
happy to give you more information. Now

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,480
on to the good stuff. Today's lightning

97
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,080
talks we have um a sample of great

98
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,080
startups and again this is

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,680
representative of some of the focus

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,680
areas that we've heard talked to today.
