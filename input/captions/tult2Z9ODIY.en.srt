[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:07,670
KAMAKSHI SUBRAMANIAN: I
think this class definitely

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,642
made me think a little
bit more outside the box.

4
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:12,350
JESSICA SHAH: It
teaches what assumptions

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,312
and what considerations
we can make.

6
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:16,520
NICO CASTRO: It just makes
you think about situations

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,820
in different contexts.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,168
And I think that's
important when you're

9
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:21,460
learning how to be an engineer.

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,360
RITU RAMAN: This class
focuses on biomechanics

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,940
and mechanobiology, two words
that sound very similar,

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,380
but are actually very different.

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,730
Biomechanics conveys the
mechanical properties

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,420
of biological materials.

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,170
And mechanobiology
teaches students

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,480
how cells feel and respond to
forces in their environment.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,920
BRANDON RIOS: It was a very
interdisciplinary class.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,870
So I thought it was a great way
to unify mechanics with biology

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,770
and how we're studying forces at
the molecular, cell, and tissue

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,508
level.

21
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,050
NICO CASTRO: This
biomechanics course

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,090
is a combination of
those, we're you're really

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,988
sort of applying those basic
principles in a useful way

24
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:10,405
and sort of showing
you, like, ah,

25
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,050
yes, biology and
mechanical engineering

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,220
are deeply rooted in each other.

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,230
- There are three sort
of ways in which cells

29
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,410
talk to each other.

30
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,740
Those are through chemical
means, through electrical means,

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,150
and through mechanical means.

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,570
The sort of chemical and
electrical communication

33
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,745
between cells has been
investigated for a long time.

34
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:34,870
RITU RAMAN: Thinking about
mechanical communication

35
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,660
between cells, that's a little
bit newer, which means that even

36
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,547
researchers are being exposed
to this for the first time.

37
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:42,130
KAMAKSHI SUBRAMANIAN:
Getting to learn

38
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,410
about research that is
still evolving as we

39
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,740
study it is super interesting.

40
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,050
PETER SO: And at the
same time, it also

41
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,110
gives a very
concrete application

42
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,995
of some of these basic theory.

43
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:58,810
JESSICA SHAH: From brain
implants, to 3D printing,

44
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,280
to tissue engineering,
to women's health.

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,400
And I think the
diversity of the class

46
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,360
provided a broader perspective
of how biomechanics can apply.

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,105
PETER SO: We talk about
some of the applications

48
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:13,900
and why the fundamental
concepts are important for many

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,080
of the applications.

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,420
KAMAKSHI SUBRAMANIAN: I got
to see the polymer model

51
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,780
first look in my thermo class.

52
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,280
Then I was like,
why is this useful?

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,030
Why are we doing this?

54
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,740
And then I came here,
and I was like, OK,

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,563
thinking about entropy in
this way is actually useful.

56
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,730
BRANDON RIOS: Getting an
intuition, that's certainly

57
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,730
has helped me, now that
I have an idea of what

58
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,730
I should look for.

59
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,900
And does that make sense?

60
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,200
Am I actually seeing
this in my research?

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,170
AYI AGBOGLO: I left not
only understanding more

62
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,770
about molecular mechanics,
but also understanding

63
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,040
just fundamentals about
thermodynamics, and energy,

64
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,470
and things that I think
will be useful just

65
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,740
as a scientist in general.

66
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,940
RITU RAMAN: When
students take this class,

67
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,700
they're getting a really unique
fusion of not only fundamentals

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,540
of mechanics, but also emerging
research in biomechanics

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,870
and mechanobiology.

70
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,512
That combination of
concepts and principles

71
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:05,970
is not something
that they're going

72
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,140
to get from any
other class at MIT

73
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,333
and will prepare them for a
broad range of future careers.

74
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,500
KAMAKSHI SUBRAMANIAN: Just
learning about the things

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,320
that I could possibly do,
like, if I decided to pursue

76
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,860
a career in biomechanics.

77
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,600
is something that's really cool.
