1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
I was trying to make sense of the

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,160
Schwartield metric while my school books

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,880
were still stuck on Newtonian mechanics.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,599
My secret weapon was MIT open course web

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
and MIT didn't just teach me science.

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759
Open learning didn't just let me study.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,279
It taught me that I don't need

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,439
permission to study physics at the

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,160
highest level. All I need is obsession

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,600
and Wi-Fi. And I'd do it again every

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,600
single chaotic second of it.
