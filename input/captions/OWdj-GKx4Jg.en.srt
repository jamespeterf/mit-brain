00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
We're here at the Harvard University

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,319
Botney Library looking at a first

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,960
edition of Robert Hook's Microraphia

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,280
published in 1665. This is the first

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,440
book to show the microscopic structure

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,360
of materials and it has a number of

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,359
remarkable drawings in it. One of the

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,199
main themes of material science is that

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,199
the properties of materials are related

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,519
to their structure and so being able to

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,359
see the structure at a microscopic scale

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,680
is very helpful. Here in this

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
illustration is a drawing of sponge. And

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,599
when we look at the scanning electron

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,600
microraph, we see that the structure is

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,840
remarkably similar to what Hook has

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,520
drawn. It's interesting to see today the

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,399
images we see in a scanning electron

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
microscope at a similar magnification to

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
those that Hook saw in his optical

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
microscope. And it's remarkable to see

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,879
how many of the features that we see in

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,879
these much more fancy microscopes that

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,840
he was able to capture in his drawings

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,520
with his simple optical microscope. Find
