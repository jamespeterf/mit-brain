00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello. Thank you so much for joining us

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,759
this evening for our 2025 cohort of

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,599
women at MIT fellows. My name is Tara

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
Webb. I'm the women at MIT project

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,000
archist at MIT.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
This fellowship that we're celebrating

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
today provides funding for artists,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,880
activists, musicians, writers, and

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,960
scholars who are engaged in the

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
expansion and expression of knowledge to

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,199
help inform the understanding of women

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,800
in MIT's history and in the history of

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
science, technology, engineering, and

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
mathematics, particularly through the

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
interdisciplinary lenses and

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
methodologies of women's studies, gender

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,559
studies, and race and ethnic studies.

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,640
This evening we will be hearing from

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,040
Jamie McGee who wrote the interactive

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
hypertext novel Athena's Archive and

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,800
from Loose Capco Lincoln who created the

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,320
short film Counteracting the

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,559
Limitations.

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
Each fellow will present for 15 to 20

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,039
minutes and then we will have a Q&A

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,879
period at the end. Feel free to add any

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,039
questions you have to the chat or

28
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,039
possibly to the Q&A box that I think

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,840
that I activated um but I'm not 100%

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,240
sure. Um, closed captions are turned on

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
and you can select close show captions

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
at the bottom of the screen if you would

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
like. There's also an option to view the

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
whole transcript. This event is being

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,880
recorded and will be posted online later

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,040
on the MIT Libraries YouTube channel.

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,680
Before we get started, I'd like to give

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,920
people a brief history of the story of

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,520
MIT for people who are not familiar with

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,240
it. MIT was founded in 1861 as a moral

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,079
act land grant university, profiting

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,799
directly off this land stolen from

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,320
forcibly forcibly displaced indigenous

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,159
people in locations throughout the

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,479
United States, including what we now

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
call California, Kansas, and Nebraska.

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,399
The land of Massachusetts, where MIT is

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,479
located, includes unseated territories

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
of the Massachusett

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,040
tribal nations. MIT was originally

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
located in Boston's Backbay, and it

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,880
moved to Cambridge in 1916. The first

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,799
classes began in 1865 and Ellen Sweller

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,040
Richards was admitted as the first woman

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
student in 1870.

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,840
Since [clears throat] then, MIT has been

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,360
a home to women scientists,

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
mathematicians, architects, and

59
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,360
engineers. Women students were granted

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,040
full traditional student status in all

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,680
departments by 1883. Although notably,

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,680
despite its diverse student status,

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
student body, and the women of color

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,520
enrolled at the institute over the

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,440
years, the first black women to graduate

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,120
from MIT did not do so until 1968, a

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
little over a hundred years after its

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
founding. So, to start off the

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,200
presentations, I'm pleased to introduce

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,760
Jamie McGee, who is a novelist and

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
historian. Her books include You Mean It

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,920
or You Don't, James Baldwin's Radical

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
Challenge with Dr. Hollowell of Duke

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,239
University and what I must tell the

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,879
world the story of Lorraine Hanssbury

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,040
with director Lena Waist McGee's work

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,360
has been supported by Harvard University

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,360
MIT and Zurich University of the Arts.

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,280
She lives in Berlin where she instructs

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,080
graduate students at Humble University.

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Jamie,

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,280
>> wonderful. Thank you for the

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
introduction and thank you everyone for

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,560
being here. I'm really excited to share

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,400
what I've been working on. Um, as a

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,720
disclaimer, I am currently visiting my

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,959
family in a rural part of an island. Um,

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,319
so you might hear chickens, just so you

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,280
know, just just go with it. You might

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,280
hear chickens. Um,

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,599
going to share my screen real quick.

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
Perfect.

93
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,799
So, Athena's Archive, um, is a hypertext

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,799
novel about the experience of women at

95
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,799
MIT.

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:42,920
Um, first Oh.

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,920
One moment. Sorry, it seems

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,560
Is it working now? Hold on.

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,879
Let me start over. I apologize.

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,879
Technology is fun. Um,

101
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,840
okay. Beautiful. Um so yes, first I want

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,280
to go over the story. Um I'll talk a

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,840
little bit about the theory of uh hyper

104
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,000
narrativity and hyperlinks um created by

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
Dr. Janet M or really developed and

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,880
forwarded by Dr. Janet Murray an MIT

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
professor. Um I'll look at the creation

108
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
process a couple of the difficulties and

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,840
then we'll follow up with the next

110
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,840
steps.

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,919
So, Athena's archive, the driving

112
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,960
question I had was, what was it like to

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,080
be a woman at MIT 100 years ago? As Tara

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,000
was saying, MIT has been around for um

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
more than a hundred years. Um, and women

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
have been allowed to be there for so

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,240
long, but their experiences have varied

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,800
so much both with race, ethnicity, but

119
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,520
then also just by decade. Um, and so

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
building on that, Athena's Archive is an

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,759
interactive digital novel that follows

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,320
three women attending MIT across three

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,000
different decades. Readers can interact

124
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
with the story by choosing their own

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,479
path through the text and in some cases

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,400
choosing their own ending. The

127
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,400
narratives are heavily based on true

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,479
stories collected through the Amida oral

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,479
history project and they build on the

130
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,039
narratological theories around hypertext

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,000
and interactivity as developed by MIT

132
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,720
professor Dr. Janet Murray.

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,639
So what is the actual story of this

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,479
novel?

135
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,280
It follows three different characters um

136
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,199
Georgie, Francine, and Shelley. Um

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,639
Geette or Georgie is a mechanical

138
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,600
engineer who graduated in 1922. Francine

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,520
is a chemistry major who graduated 1949.

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
And Shelley is a mathematician who

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
graduated in 1965.

142
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,400
And these three characters, they are

143
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,320
fictionalized, but they are drawn from a

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
lot of different accounts that were

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
given in the oral histories. I chose

146
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,720
these decades in particular um because I

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,479
wanted a broader spread of women's

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
experiences rather than just pick one

149
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
decade or even one year. And I thought

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
that this would give a really good

151
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,120
introduction to the experience of women

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,039
at MIT um across the early to mid 20th

153
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,880
century.

154
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,120
Specifically um I based all of these uh

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,840
these three stories on the oral history

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,639
accounts from 44 different MIT grads. Um

157
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,319
Amida right now has I think 121

158
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,840
interviews. Um, and I went through all

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
of them, but I ended up going with these

160
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
44 and picking vignettes. Some, uh,

161
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,800
people I just picked a few lines or

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,240
ideas from. Some I went more in depth.

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
Um, but these I do want to give credit

164
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,919
where credit is due. Um, these 44 women

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,919
really inspired the story.

166
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,759
Next, I want to just quickly go through

167
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,680
the three different strands. The way

168
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,639
that the novel is set up, um, at the

169
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,720
beginning, early choices will allow the

170
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,080
reader to take one of three different

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,759
paths to follow one of three different

172
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,280
characters. And then along the way,

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,440
they'll be able to make different

174
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,080
choices and interact with the story in

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,759
different ways. The first character

176
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,000
taking place 1920s is Georgie.

177
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,720
After World War I forces her to flee her

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,240
home in Belgium, Geette or Georgie

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,840
struggles to adjust to the United

180
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,520
States. The men at MIT who can't believe

181
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,560
there's a woman in their engineering

182
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,319
classes just make life worse.

183
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
A slow burning friendship with another

184
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,960
female student finally makes Georgie

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,479
feel at home. But when tragedy drives

186
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,280
them apart, will she have anywhere left

187
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,280
to go? That's a synopsis of her strand

188
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,800
of the story. And then to give a bit of

189
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,560
a feel about um how the text and the

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
textuality of the story is set up, I'll

191
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,280
read the opening lines from her part of

192
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,520
the narrative.

193
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,680
Home, you see, is the dead place.

194
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,520
When I close my eyes, home is a burnt

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,440
black spot, scorched and cracking

196
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
through the earth. It is a graveyard

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,639
with the soil still loose. It is typhus

198
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,919
soarses and mortal shadows and newspaper

199
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,240
photos I tear into little tiny pieces.

200
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,520
You would tear them, too.

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,520
It wasn't always this way.

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,400
The second character is Francine, who

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,319
takes place in 1949.

204
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,080
Born into poverty, Francine has

205
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,199
struggled and sweated for everything in

206
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,000
life. She dreams of becoming a doctor

207
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,919
after she graduates from MIT so that she

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
can finally put her financial stress

209
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,360
behind her.

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,680
For medical school, though, she needs

211
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199
money and she'll do any odd job to get

212
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,039
it.

213
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,760
But when one final jaw becomes more

214
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,479
sinister than it seems, will Francine be

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,640
able to recover, or are her dreams gone

216
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,440
for good?

217
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,440
And the opening to her section is as

218
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,440
follows.

219
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,440
Regret is a luxury reserved for those

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,519
with time and money. Do I wish things

221
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
had been different? Do I wish I turned

222
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
down that last money gig? Do I wish

223
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Harvard Medical School hadn't resended

224
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,320
its offer and my life hadn't gone the

225
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,680
way it did? Well, there's no time to

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,519
wish because I have bills to pay.

227
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,399
That's why I took that last gig, after

228
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,519
all, and why I ruined my life. I had

229
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,519
bills to pay.

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,440
And the final character who takes place

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,360
in the 1960s is Shelly.

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,279
This is the synopsis of her strand of

233
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,080
the novel.

234
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,200
Shelley has never been a girl's girl.

235
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,880
She's never had to be. As a beautiful

236
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
cultured expat, she's always turned

237
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,360
every head in the room and gotten

238
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,200
exactly what she wanted from men. It was

239
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,279
true overseas and now it's true at MIT.

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,760
But when the man she trusts the most is

241
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,440
the same man to destroy her career, she

242
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,560
might have to find out whether there's

243
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,560
truly strength in sisterhood.

244
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,040
the opening to her novel.

245
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,279
Men made me what I am. My father raised

246
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,680
me to be brave. My brothers trained me

247
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,640
to be strong. And my husband sharpened

248
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,040
my wit. But my mother unfortunately made

249
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,680
me a woman. She birthed me with this

250
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,079
curse. See, everything good that I am,

251
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,760
well, that came from men.

252
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,760
Well, at least that's what I thought

253
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,760
until the same men destroyed my life.

254
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,360
Now I want to go a little bit into the

255
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,720
underlying theories and methodologies

256
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,000
that I used in order to create this

257
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,600
interactive novel.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
Specifically, I want to answer these two

259
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,839
questions. One, what is interactive

260
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,440
hyperfiction? And very closely related

261
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,440
to that, who is Dr. Janet Murray?

262
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,839
Hyperfiction uh is just a digital novel

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,959
that allows reader to traverse and

264
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,200
progress through a narrative via

265
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,440
hyperlinks rather than turned pages. So

266
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
they can generally proceed in almost any

267
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
order that they want to. They can loop

268
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,519
back around. They can take different

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
paths. They can jump from story to

270
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
story. It really allows them to have a

271
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
choice in how they want to experience a

272
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,279
certain story. It allows for greater

273
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,519
agency as well as in some cases

274
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,839
depending on the material greater

275
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,240
learning because it's been used as a

276
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,720
learning tool. Um, in fact, it was

277
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
largely spearheaded by former MIT

278
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,360
professor Dr. Janet Murray, um, who

279
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
first really got involved in this format

280
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
because she wanted to use it to develop

281
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,920
language learning projects. Um, and it

282
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
was her archival materials that I pulled

283
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,760
on um, the most in order to get the

284
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,160
theory and the basis for this project.

285
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,040
So going hand inhand with that the

286
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,000
actual creative process of it

287
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,399
step one was to gather all the

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,120
interviews um as mentioned there were

289
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,200
about 121 and I nailed it down to 44 but

290
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,040
first I had to go through all of them.

291
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:00,079
Um, originally I wanted uh to just focus

292
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,640
on a

293
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,000
originally I wanted to just focus on

294
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,600
computer science because I thought that

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
it would go hand inand you know like a

296
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,519
digital medium with people who are

297
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,040
studying um the digital arts. However,

298
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
once I really started getting into the

299
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,160
different interviews, I realized I just

300
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,519
had to include more perspectives.

301
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,800
And I also knew that I wanted to work on

302
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
the interviews because I wanted to

303
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,880
prioritize the actual worlds of women

304
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,079
and their experiences rather than my own

305
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,519
narrative. Um, after all, who knows what

306
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,880
it's like to live through this time

307
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,040
better than the people who actually

308
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,720
lived it. Um, I had thought about many

309
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,959
different ways to approach this. Um,

310
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,040
where one of them was to use a lot of

311
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,440
secondary material. Um, and I'll talk a

312
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,560
bit about the problems I ran into later,

313
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
but originally this is going to be a

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
very different project. Um, and one I

315
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,880
would end up having to use a lot of

316
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,519
secondary material for. However, turning

317
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,120
to the interviews allowed me to get a

318
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,120
much more present and a much more

319
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
immediate look at that time period. And

320
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
so once I discovered these um it was a

321
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,040
no-brainer. I decided I really wanted to

322
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,839
prioritize the words of the actual women

323
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,000
who lived this. Um and what changed my

324
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,839
mind specifically was when I was reading

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,639
through for fun um just one of the a

326
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,160
couple of the interviews. I was like,

327
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,760
"Oh, what is this project?" And I

328
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,560
decided to start with the earliest one I

329
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,399
found, which was from 1922 out of pure

330
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,519
curiosity. um she's like, "Oh, what was

331
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,360
it like to be back there?" Because it

332
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,959
was so different. Um I assumed, but I

333
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
didn't know how. And then on the first

334
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,760
pages, she was talking about learning

335
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,000
wireless telegraphy um to aid the World

336
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,360
War I effort and then about how she was

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,880
struggling to find a career during the

338
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,880
1920s because they wouldn't hire women

339
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
at all. And then about during the Great

340
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
Depression and then she talked about

341
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,079
discovering bootleg coal mines. I was

342
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,760
like, "This is very different." Um and I

343
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,279
really want to include these points. And

344
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,360
so after hers, I started wondering what

345
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,040
else am I missing? And so I started to

346
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,040
go down a rabbit hole. First, I read the

347
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,440
1920s accounts, then the 1930s accounts,

348
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,959
the 1940s accounts, and then by the time

349
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,399
uh I had gotten to the end, I was like,

350
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,720
"This is all too fascinating. My problem

351
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,199
is I don't know what to cut out because

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
I want to include it all, which led to

353
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,360
step two, which is all of the annotating

354
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
that I ended up doing. Um, I ended up

355
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,480
taking really extensive notes because I

356
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
knew that I wanted to make a project out

357
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
of this, but I wasn't quite sure what

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,760
exactly format I wanted to take or what

359
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,240
format I wanted the narrative to take.

360
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Um, so I took different notes on a lot

361
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,639
of different elements and different

362
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,320
themes so that I could go back um and

363
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,040
have that ready for whichever path that

364
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,760
I wanted to take. Uh, and in the end uh

365
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,360
I ended up going through 3100 pages of

366
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,160
interviews. They're all very colorful so

367
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,399
they're kind of fun to look at.

368
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,480
But uh I would say that this was one of

369
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,839
the hardest parts um was actually

370
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,160
narrowing everything down. reading, but

371
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,000
3100 pages had taken a long time, but in

372
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,760
some ways, cutting it down was harder

373
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,880
because, as mentioned, I wanted to use

374
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,480
details from um everything really. Um,

375
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,440
and in the end, I had to leave a lot of

376
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,440
my favorite um inserts on the cutting

377
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
room floor because they just didn't fit

378
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,639
in with the rest of the narrative um in

379
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,079
this particular iteration. Maybe I'll

380
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,120
expand it later and bring in some of

381
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,000
these. Um, I want to read one of the

382
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,519
stories that particularly struck me that

383
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
I didn't wasn't able to fit in because

384
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,480
it didn't fit the time period that I

385
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,959
wanted to work with. Um, but this is one

386
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,120
of the first vignettes that I read where

387
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,680
I was like, "Oh this is a kick in the

388
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,000
stomach."

389
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,560
One funny episode is when I got

390
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,760
pregnant, I decided to work on my

391
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,160
teaching and get a grant and get

392
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,320
established for three years. And once I

393
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,480
got all of that, I said, "Okay, now I'm

394
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,839
going to have a baby." When I got

395
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,320
pregnant, they had this little handbook

396
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,639
for employees. And I was looking through

397
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,360
to see what there'd be for maternity and

398
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,600
it just said, well, I don't know what it

399
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,839
said because I couldn't find it. I was

400
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,639
flipping through and finally it says

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,560
pregnancy c disability.

402
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,320
So, I turned to the page for disability

403
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,959
and it says you can get two weeks off if

404
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,680
you have a doctor's note. That's what

405
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,639
we're working with.

406
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,360
Uh then I went through and I decided to

407
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,959
sort everything. Um once I narrowed down

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,399
the 3100 pages to about 100 or 150 pages

409
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,759
of different vignettes that I wanted to

410
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,000
use, I need to decide how to arrange and

411
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,720
build the text into an actual narrative

412
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,040
that people could interact with. Um and

413
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,160
so I settled on doing in three different

414
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,320
layers. In layer one, I decided that um

415
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,639
for each girl, Georgie, Francine, and

416
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,639
Shelley, I would choose one specific

417
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,839
Amita interview and use that as sort of

418
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,000
a base, a skeleton. I would take the

419
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,160
most bare bones details from that and

420
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
the major overall,

421
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,519
I guess, narrative arc, you could say,

422
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,600
from what the women had described um

423
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,880
their time at MIT. And then I would

424
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,399
build on top of that. And of course, I

425
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
would change um different names and

426
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,680
different details. didn't want to take

427
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,519
someone else's life and just completely

428
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,959
like redo it and like fictionalize it

429
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,600
and say, "Okay, this is my work now."

430
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,440
It's more if I read a story and an

431
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
emotional arc in it really struck me and

432
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,320
I thought, "Okay, this is something that

433
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,839
I do think really needs to be shared and

434
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,720
really needs to be put forward." So, I

435
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:02,639
focus on that. Um, so for example,

436
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,880
Francine, um, the one who had to work

437
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,280
and overwork is based on a real woman

438
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,880
who had to struggle and fight her way

439
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,360
all the way through MIT because she was

440
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,039
getting absolutely no support. Um, we'll

441
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,959
call her Jane D. Um, and she really did

442
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,400
lose her spot at Harvard Medical School

443
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,280
um, because she was doing a lot of odd

444
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
jobs because she had to do said jobs to

445
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,600
make enough money um, to try to save up

446
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,400
after going to MIT for medical school.

447
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Um but one of her final jobs she was

448
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,760
caught on camera doing something

449
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
scandalous with a goldfish. Harvard

450
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,400
medical school saw that in the newspaper

451
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,919
and then rescended her offer. Um and in

452
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,440
the interview she talked a lot about how

453
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,280
she wished she hadn't taken all of those

454
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
jobs but she also felt she had no choice

455
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,960
because she needed money. And so her

456
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,240
story um as I said in the interview and

457
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,679
also I suppose like in in this to a

458
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,120
large extent is just about really

459
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,039
wanting and striving and trying to work

460
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,320
hard for what you want. But when that

461
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,679
working hard is also the thing that

462
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,720
takes away your dream. Like how do you

463
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,280
hold those two things together?

464
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
After I have narrative one or like layer

465
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,440
one like the narrative core, I decided

466
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,240
to flesh out each character. So I would

467
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,480
choose two or three other interviews um

468
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,559
and interview subjects that I found

469
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,120
particularly striking and pull heavily

470
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,520
from those as well. So for example with

471
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,679
let's call her Jane D again um while I

472
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,600
was trying to build out her story uh

473
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,240
she'd mentioned that she was struggling

474
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
for money since she was a child but she

475
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,000
hadn't really given a lot of details

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,360
about her childhood. But then I read the

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,799
interview from another story, another

478
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
female student who described what her

479
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,799
life was like growing up in a hotel um

480
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
that her parents owned and it was crazy

481
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,000
and it was colorful and it was also like

482
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
a speak easy and it was legal and

483
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
underground and it's kind of also like a

484
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,760
circus and a lot was going on. It was

485
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,679
really like fascinating. Um and so I

486
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,240
decided to combine that with the

487
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,720
original J&D story. Um so I thought,

488
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,880
okay, what if um this fictional

489
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,559
character is struggling for money

490
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,000
because her parents own a hotel because

491
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,600
this was during the Great Depression.

492
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,720
Um, and so if you own a hotel during the

493
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,880
Great Depression when no one actually

494
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,960
has money to go to a hotel, um, then

495
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
that would put you in on hard times. Um,

496
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,760
and so these are ways that I started

497
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,600
combining stories that would also have

498
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,720
as many different perspectives from as

499
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,080
many different women at MIT as possible.

500
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,679
And then for the third layer, I would

501
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,679
sprinkle in bits of stories and

502
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,600
vignettes from other interviews because,

503
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
as you saw, there was just so much I

504
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,039
wanted to include and so many stories

505
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
and tiny anecdotes that I thought were

506
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,080
really important. And it kind of broke

507
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
my heart that I mean if you go and

508
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
search these interviews out of course

509
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,919
you'll read them but for people who

510
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,280
don't actively search out these

511
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,360
interviews and I feel like it's a lot of

512
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,520
fascinating things are and important

513
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,080
information is just going unheard and

514
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,720
unappreciated. Um and so I really wanted

515
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,400
to sprinkle in as much as I could um

516
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,640
that still fit the story but things I

517
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
thought were just I felt that they were

518
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,120
really important. They're things that

519
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,679
moved me when I read them. So I thought

520
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,840
it was important to put them in.

521
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,240
Um, and one

522
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,240
story that I liked and I actually

523
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,360
sprinkled it in through all three

524
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,799
narrative strands, um, was the story of

525
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,720
this one woman, how she was in class,

526
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,200
place during the 60s and she was in

527
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,360
class and a professor started jabbing at

528
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
her because she was the only woman and

529
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,400
she ignored him, but they started making

530
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
really runchy, sexist jokes, and the

531
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,679
woman walked out. Um, but then also all

532
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,039
the men in the class also got out and

533
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,240
walked out with her and she was so

534
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,919
shocked because she hadn't spoken to any

535
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,520
of them. Um it was just

536
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,080
she was really moved by that little bit

537
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,480
of solidarity. And so I included that in

538
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,640
the 1920s I had well men probably

539
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,039
wouldn't walk out at all. Um and the

540
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,840
woman might not even walk out because uh

541
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,159
in the 1920s the the accounts I read the

542
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
women were just so grateful to be there

543
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,520
that they didn't even dare speak out

544
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,360
against sexism at all. Um from the

545
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,280
interviews they talked about that. The

546
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,480
1940s I had that okay a woman walked out

547
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,640
but the men probably wouldn't walk out

548
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
with her. And the 1960s I included the

549
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,520
original story which is when by that

550
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,720
time the men also did walk out. Um and I

551
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,400
kind of did that. I know obviously

552
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,400
progress isn't perfect or a straight

553
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,480
line but I did think that this was an

554
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,720
opportunity to show how different

555
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,039
attitudes towards women and specifically

556
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,039
women at MIT can shift across different

557
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,039
decades.

558
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,400
And in the part where actually turning

559
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,960
um the different interviews into actual

560
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,200
elements of the story, I really wanted

561
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,600
to keep the details the same. Um and I

562
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,360
wanted to prioritize women's original

563
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,000
voices. Um I thought that was really

564
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,120
important, but I also did need to add a

565
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,320
little bit of narrative connective

566
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,000
tissue in certain places that tie

567
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,400
everything together, especially because

568
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,720
I'm combining strands from so many

569
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,640
different stories. Um, and also because

570
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,919
it's interactive, readers can choose to

571
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,200
go down certain paths and they'll see

572
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,960
some things and they won't see other

573
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,440
things. Um, and so I had to figure out a

574
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,679
way to make the stories flow together

575
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,200
and make sense even if you have only

576
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,440
seen one half of it and you completely

577
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,600
missed or bypassed another half. Um, so

578
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,520
a lot of the fictionalizing that I did

579
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,280
was to bring these different elements

580
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,159
together. So here's an example of um an

581
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,880
passage. This part is the

582
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,559
uh actual quote from the woman. And the

583
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,200
next slide I'll show the way that I

584
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,360
added um a bit more of a literary voice

585
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,120
to it so that it was more cohesive with

586
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,440
the rest of the text as an example of

587
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,600
the work that I ended up doing. Um

588
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,360
well, I missed having that as a career

589
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,679
because I really wanted to go to medical

590
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,559
school. I didn't have any money to do

591
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,120
that. I didn't have any money at all. I

592
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,520
was already married even then, but I

593
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:39,039
always wanted to go to medical school.

594
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,240
And then the fictionalized version,

595
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,320
I missed it. You know, my chance. We all

596
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,520
get one chance in life and I missed

597
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,320
mine. Sometimes I like to delude myself

598
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,919
and pretend it's not too late. It help

599
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,559
keeps me saying this little lie because

600
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,400
otherwise I have to accept that it's

601
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
over.

602
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
It's hard to believe that I had the

603
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,280
grades, I had the admission, I had my

604
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,720
whole career ahead of me. But the money

605
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,600
just wasn't there. Money, it's always

606
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,960
always money in the end, isn't it? I

607
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
wanted to go to medical school, but I

608
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,280
didn't have the money to go, so I didn't

609
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,760
go. 2 plus 2 is four, and it will always

610
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,960
equal four. And besides, I was married,

611
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,280
so when would I have found the time?

612
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,280
Still, I always wanted to go to medical

613
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
school.

614
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
And the final step of this was to

615
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,440
actually turn this into a narrative that

616
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,799
people could play with, um, which is the

617
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,480
coding section. And because I'm a

618
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,159
novelist by trade and not a computer

619
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
scientist, this part was the most

620
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,480
difficult, but I had a lot of friends

621
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,799
who did a lot of help. Um, and so yeah,

622
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
it ended up I use Twine um, which is

623
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,400
just an open source software

624
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,320
particularly made um, for interactive

625
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,240
narrative and then Twine combined with

626
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,360
CSS.

627
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:57,360
And so for this um I wanted to just

628
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,679
finish up by giving an example um of

629
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,960
uh the the narrative just to like walk

630
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,200
through a bit how it works and how it

631
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
ended up looking. Um I'm still going

632
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,320
through and like finishing up play

633
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,400
testing and editing for bugs and

634
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,919
everything like that. Um and obviously I

635
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,760
can't show the whole game right now.

636
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
This is a 20-minute presentation. I'm

637
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,360
bumping up against that. Um but I did

638
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,159
want to show uh just a little bit to

639
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,760
give a taste.

640
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,840
So the

641
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,080
yes okay so the context for this um is

642
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,159
Georgie's story and her family fled

643
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,279
Belgium um for the US before World War I

644
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
began when she was still a young

645
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,159
teenager because they did sense the

646
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,679
danger that was brewing. Um since then

647
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,760
she spent all of high school trying to

648
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,400
feel at home and fit in in America but

649
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,080
it's not working. One of her teachers

650
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
suggested she join the war effort by

651
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,520
learning wireless telegraphy.

652
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,200
um she and her female classmates did and

653
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,799
marched over to the military and said

654
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
quote we are ready to save the world for

655
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,200
democracy but the military turned them

656
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,559
down because they were teenage girls. Um

657
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,440
and so Georgie decided to become a

658
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,240
farmer instead and that's that part is

659
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,840
actually part of a true story. Um this

660
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
is picking up where she's describing

661
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,360
that and I wanted to give a piece of how

662
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,640
she got to MIT.

663
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,120
Jordy says, "So then we decided, well

664
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,120
then we'll become farmerrettes."

665
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,720
Now this isn't a word that's common

666
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,279
today, although people who lived it in

667
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,200
that time remember it very well. See, if

668
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,159
you were a farmer, you saved the world

669
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,760
for democracy by shoveling manure. And

670
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,520
what you did was you went to a farm

671
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,919
school and we took the place of men who

672
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,039
were fighting the war. So we shoveled

673
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,080
manure all day and I'm sure that helped

674
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,000
save the world for democracy.

675
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Um, and then clearly the red words are

676
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,440
the hyperlinks. So then depending on

677
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,480
which one the reader clicks, it will

678
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,640
take them down a slightly different

679
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,320
narrative path. Um, for example, you

680
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,559
click save the world for democracy and

681
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,240
then it leads to this next path.

682
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,120
Still, I dedicated every night to

683
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,919
tinkering with my crystal radio. I spent

684
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,520
hours hunched over that tiny little box,

685
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,080
fiddling with the cat's whisker probe

686
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,279
and the Kina crystal, listening for

687
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,720
distant Morris code signals.

688
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,480
And with my fingers on the desk, I

689
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,480
drummed out all the words I wished I

690
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
could scent.

691
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,200
And then the reader can choose which of

692
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
those Morse code paths they want to

693
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,400
follow. They choose the first one. It

694
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,240
means home. The second one, it means

695
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,640
family.

696
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,640
The third one, it means longing. And all

697
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,039
three of those paths will lead back to

698
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,960
this one.

699
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,039
Even though I didn't have a transmitter,

700
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
part of me hoped that someone back in

701
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,799
Belgium would hear me and send a message

702
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,520
back. and that I'd be the only one in

703
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,440
the world to receive it. If I just kept

704
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,360
listening hard enough, this could come

705
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,880
true. And because she wanted to be the

706
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,559
only one in the world, there's also only

707
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,640
one hyperlink on this page.

708
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,320
My classmates had no idea that I kept up

709
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,039
with the crystal radio long after the

710
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,960
military had rejected us. When she found

711
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,360
out, one said, "Well, you oughtn't go to

712
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,120
Smith College. You ought to go to MIT."

713
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,279
And actually clicking MIT will lead you

714
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,799
to how she got to MIT.

715
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,120
And these are her actual words. I didn't

716
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,600
change these. She said MIT they don't

717
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,440
take girls but the idea stuck in my crop

718
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,039
but I wrote a letter to the registar and

719
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,679
I signed my initials so he wouldn't know

720
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,360
I was a girl and the circular came and I

721
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,840
looked through it and on the very last

722
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,919
page it says something about female

723
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,919
students in small print and I said ah

724
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,480
they must take girls if it says female

725
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:31,000
students. So I ran for my aunt and I

726
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,000
said would you take me to see the dean?

727
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,760
I'm quickly touching on a couple of the

728
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,159
difficulties that we bumped into.

729
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,520
Um first was the lack of material on the

730
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,600
Athena project which is the project um

731
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,880
that Janet Murray spearheaded and was

732
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,880
actually what I really wanted to focus

733
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,799
this on originally. Um my original

734
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,240
project was to create a hypertext novel

735
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,760
about the creation of the Athena

736
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,000
language learning project and the

737
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,640
experience of women specifically at MIT

738
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,480
during that project. Um so that project

739
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
developed by Dr. Murray aimed to use

740
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,399
different interactive scenarios to teach

741
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
learners French. Um, for example, by

742
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,440
playing a video game where the

743
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,840
protagonist needs to read apartment ads

744
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,520
and rent an apartment, then the player

745
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,120
would theoretically learn how to read

746
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,559
apartment ads in French and rent an

747
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,559
apartment in French, which was

748
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
groundbreaking um for the 1980s. It

749
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,080
would be groundbreaking even today

750
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
really. Um, however, when I went through

751
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,720
Murray's archives, there was not enough

752
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,559
material on the actual um creation.

753
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,640
there was material

754
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,480
uh there were very dry notes and there

755
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,440
were programmer notes um but there

756
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,799
wasn't a lot of actual emotional detail

757
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,919
um which I was kind of hoping maybe you

758
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,799
never know what's going to pop up in the

759
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,399
archives um but it wasn't that um but I

760
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,559
knew that I really wanted to include

761
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,240
perspectives of women at this time so

762
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,159
switching to the Amita oral history

763
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,279
project was I think the best decision I

764
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,600
could have made because it really gave

765
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,799
everything I was looking for uh the

766
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,200
second issue was a lack of certain

767
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,399
narratives um as Tara mentioned the

768
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,600
first black woman didn't graduate till

769
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,520
the 60s. Um, and there were very few uh

770
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,480
narratives from queer people, POC

771
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,640
people, disabled people, and the few

772
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,039
narratives that there were painted a

773
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,159
very different picture of MIT than the

774
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,120
other narratives did, which I found

775
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,320
interesting. Um, for example, a lot of

776
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,600
the women, I would say 40% of them of

777
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,960
the interviews that I read loved

778
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
McCormack the House and loved living

779
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,440
with women and said it was like a

780
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,360
sorority and said they felt so at home

781
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,039
and they really loved this. They finally

782
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,880
had their own dorm and their own space.

783
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,159
But then I read a narrative from um it

784
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,760
might have been Shirley Jackson, one of

785
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,919
the black women there who talked about

786
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,440
how she said in McCormack, no one spoke

787
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,120
to her. It was really awkward and she

788
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,240
didn't feel comfortable there and like

789
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,600
that was all she had to say. She's like,

790
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
"Yeah, I did like it. No one talked to

791
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,559
me." I was like, "Oh, that's a new

792
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,360
perspective." Uh and that's important.

793
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,320
Those things are really important

794
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,760
because it's something I wouldn't have

795
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,200
thought about if it hadn't been. But

796
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,640
there were only um I think two or three

797
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,840
interviews from black women or at least

798
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,200
women who identified themselves as black

799
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,760
in the actual interview. a couple from

800
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,000
people who identified as Latino Latina

801
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,559
um and one who um I think was from China

802
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,200
I believe um but then again out of 121

803
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,799
interviews total this is very small um

804
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,480
and then also going hand in hand there

805
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,559
was a lot from the 1960s which makes

806
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,760
sense because that's also um when it

807
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,240
seemed like larger numbers of women um

808
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,240
started to graduate from MIT and also

809
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,240
just the availability of who is still

810
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,640
alive to give interviews um when this

811
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,440
project started but I decided that did

812
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,039
want to also look at the 1920s,30s, 40s,

813
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,480
and the earlier decades to really see

814
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,640
how it had transformed because by the

815
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,320
1960s, it wasn't perfect. Um, but it was

816
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,760
a lot better than it had been 40 years

817
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,480
ago. And so, I wanted to be able to show

818
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,720
that shift.

819
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,559
So, from here, um, it's in the very

820
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,640
final stages. I'm just doing a lot, uh,

821
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,399
like last minute going through all the

822
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,159
modes and like having a couple of, um,

823
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,760
play tests also go through everything

824
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,360
just to make sure everything's in place

825
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,440
and then naturally turn it over to um,

826
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,840
MIT um, if they want to put it on the

827
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,720
website. It's just HTML and CSS, so it's

828
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,320
very easy to host. Um, and yeah, and so

829
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,399
thank you, uh, thank you very much,

830
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,240
Terara, and also the MIT team. Thank you

831
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,520
for all of your help. They were so, so

832
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,840
useful for sending me all the different

833
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,200
resources and for going, um, with me

834
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,200
through the archives because I had to do

835
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,880
it digitally. Um, and so they were

836
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,320
really wonderful and so I appreciate the

837
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,520
support and thank you for having us

838
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,919
here.

839
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,799
>> Thank you so much, Jamie. That was

840
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,480
really cool. Next we have Loose Tappo

841
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,240
Lincoln who is a Brooklyn based

842
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,640
filmmaker, artist and cultural worker

843
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,720
born in Gainesville, Florida. Lincoln's

844
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,320
artwork and films transverse time

845
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,480
connecting historical stories to the

846
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,880
present day to imagine the future. His

847
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,399
works take form as personal documentary

848
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,351
documentaries, collaborative

849
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,600
experimental films and multimedia

850
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,679
[clears throat] installations.

851
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,919
Currently, Lincoln is directing

852
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,840
slashproducing a feature documentary

853
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,440
autobiography of a scientist working

854
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,919
title about their mother who attended

855
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,440
MIT in the 1960s. Lincoln is a

856
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,039
co-founder of an intergenerational

857
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,600
worker-owned media cooperative

858
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,919
Shadowwork Media and an art curatorial

859
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,080
project, Tala Arts. Lincoln studied film

860
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,320
and video at Antioch College and holds

861
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,799
an MFA in film and media arts from

862
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,799
Temple University.

863
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,919
Thank you so much for that introduction.

864
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,840
And let me see if I can do the tech of

865
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,519
this.

866
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,440
Um,

867
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,360
if I hit play, does this

868
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,360
work for folks? Can everyone see it?

869
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Well,

870
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,279
um, I tend to be a little bit more

871
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,440
interactive, so apologies as I'm like

872
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:27,840
trying to figure out the Zoom and how to

873
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:31,200
find my chat. Wait, how do I This might

874
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,320
not be my forte. Okay, so I do want to

875
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,720
do some some upfront like I can't really

876
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,039
see my chat, so I will go back to the

877
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,799
chat thing. I'll have Tara help me if I

878
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,039
need to. Um, but uh yeah, so welcome to

879
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,399
my presentation of this work in progress

880
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:51,360
called counteracting the limitations. Um

881
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:55,760
I what I'm going to go through today is

882
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,640
more of a theoretical process, some

883
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,000
context of how I got here, um what I

884
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,399
found in the AR in in the MIT um

885
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,519
distinctive collections and then also

886
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,600
share um you know some rough things here

887
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,000
and there um with uh a caveat to say

888
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,640
that the film is in progress. films take

889
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,799
a while to put together. Um, and but I

890
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,799
feel really excited about the script

891
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,840
form that it's taking right now. Um,

892
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,919
so as we go. So before I get started,

893
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,799
this is the one where I wish I had the

894
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,600
chat up and um it's just that I would

895
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:38,080
love for folks to think about this word

896
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,720
archive and think about when I say this

897
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,120
word, what are the thoughts, feelings,

898
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,120
reactions, maybe even sensory

899
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,120
impressions that come up for you. Um I

900
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,919
don't I think I was want to start here

901
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,080
because I feel like this is where I

902
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,240
started is that I um applied to this

903
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,658
fellowship and got really excited about

904
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,640
it because well I love the archives

905
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:05,279
[laughter]

906
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,760
and maybe I romanticized the archives

907
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:14,320
quite a bit and so um I just would love

908
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:17,679
to see in like what people's uh yeah

909
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,839
thoughts Sorry about the archive.

910
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,119
Um,

911
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,679
this is where I want to be a little

912
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,919
interactive. Anybody, if anyone typed

913
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,079
anything in, can somebody get off mic

914
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,440
and say it to me since I can't see the

915
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,679
chat?

916
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,119
>> I'll read anything that comes up.

917
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,720
>> Okay. Thank you.

918
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,000
All right.

919
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,480
Well, um, for me, I'll start with, um,

920
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,839
just thinking about, uh, the the

921
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,760
cultural producers, the theorists, the

922
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,240
writers out there who are really working

923
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,240
in the archives. And we can't really go

924
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,800
that far without thinking about Sadia

925
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,800
Hartman's work. And I just love this

926
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,359
quote so much that I wanted to share it

927
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,680
with you before I start which is um

928
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:08,880
really sort of embodied uh where I I

929
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,280
feel like this work has taken me. I work

930
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,440
intuitively and I will follow a trail of

931
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,079
documents or my instincts until the

932
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,040
project emerges. I have an impression of

933
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,119
the kind of thing I might want to do and

934
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,920
that's very clear as opposed to having a

935
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,680
full outline of the book. I think partly

936
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,400
it's because of the way I engage

937
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,640
archival materials. I have a deep

938
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,040
encounter with them. Sometimes that

939
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,280
means there are things that I think I'm

940
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,359
going to write about that actually can't

941
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,720
write about once I encounter that

942
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,560
particular material or sometimes it just

943
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,680
takes me in a direction that I wasn't

944
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,160
expecting to go in at all.

945
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,640
So I just wanted to you know think about

946
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,440
that. Um and

947
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,839
I will start with some of the questions

948
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,400
that I came to this project with. Um

949
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,839
really uh I'm grounded in a lot of

950
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,240
personal work um using my film and

951
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,040
artwork to really like explore personal

952
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,960
stories. So really I started there. What

953
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,720
personal stories can be unearthed to

954
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,839
show the historical connections between

955
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,599
science and technology and on one hand

956
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,920
and the historical oppression on the

957
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,800
other? What are common tools and ways

958
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,280
forward that women um were implemented

959
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,599
to find their own voice and pathways to

960
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,400
success? And what are personal

961
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,320
narratives um from the act archives that

962
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,920
u demonstrate survival resilient

963
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:39,040
strategies um that can be uplifted? So

964
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,960
really thinking about um

965
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,359
yeah like how do we how do we kind of

966
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,640
come back to uh using the archives as a

967
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,280
way to be like all the answers are there

968
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,440
right like in some ways not maybe not

969
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,400
all the answers but some things that

970
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,280
that um is about

971
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,599
people's experiences and having tools

972
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,359
and and and

973
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:08,800
survived uh places like

974
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:13,119
MIT, right? Um Jamie, you gave a great

975
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:16,000
context for for for the 20s, 40s, and

976
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,160
60s. And um I appreciate that because

977
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,680
I'm going to take the baton and take us

978
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,200
from the 60s onward. So, um so let's

979
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,640
start with, you know, the personal

980
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,040
archive, right? So, this is where I

981
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,440
usually start all my work. um is to

982
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,440
think about well what am I thinking

983
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,280
about in my personal life that I need

984
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,880
answers to or what are what are some

985
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,240
curiosities

986
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,839
and um I just want to start here.

987
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,599
So this is me and my mom Gloria Capo

988
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,200
Lincoln and um you know when I think

989
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,359
about personal archives I think about

990
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:57,200
photo albums. I think about um I think

991
00:37:53,359 --> 00:38:01,680
about the ways uh papers are left around

992
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,200
my my family's house or even um books. I

993
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,119
think about a lot of like think about

994
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,280
all the things objects that are left

995
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,000
around um for us to be able to touch. Um

996
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,160
and then I think at some point there's a

997
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,160
there's a clarity that there's a lot of

998
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,160
things that are aren't left around,

999
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,880
right? like maybe the best-selling

1000
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,079
novels of the 1980s

1001
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,040
are really in the bookshelves, but maybe

1002
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,480
not um those stories that we really need

1003
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,880
to hear about. Like um for me it was I

1004
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,720
really uh was born I was born in

1005
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,280
Gainesville, Florida. Um, I had a lot of

1006
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,560
clarity about

1007
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,079
uh my dad's family who was from

1008
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,839
Massachusetts.

1009
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:51,280
Um, and this, you know, very white

1010
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,200
family that uh I could travel to. And I

1011
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,320
would always ask stories about my mom

1012
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,599
and and I never really felt it. I didn't

1013
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,200
I didn't have the objects of of her

1014
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,720
childhood. Um I I w was able to go back

1015
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,760
to the Philippines but there was a big

1016
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,000
chunk of time where um I was a child and

1017
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,920
we didn't go back

1018
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,839
for a lot of reasons and a lot of them

1019
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,599
had to do with social political reasons

1020
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:20,647
and and so um so that's kind of how I

1021
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,280
started this journey back in college.

1022
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:23,680
[laughter]

1023
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,000
So this is like 20 years ago I started

1024
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,560
to be like well let me gather my mom's

1025
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,320
stories and so here we are continuing

1026
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,320
that. So, in in 2021, I started

1027
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,640
recording my mom. I started recording

1028
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,000
her a lot before that, but to this is

1029
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,800
when I was like, I'm going to do a

1030
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,000
future documentary about my mom.

1031
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:48,000
And um so that trailer exists and I'm

1032
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,200
going to drop it in the chat when I find

1033
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,240
my chat thing again. I will drop it

1034
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,040
before the end of this talk. Um but uh

1035
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,280
one of the things that uh really excited

1036
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,359
me about this fellowship was that I

1037
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,839
could deepen the context of her story,

1038
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:11,760
right? Um because I get a lot of a lot

1039
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,320
of visuals, a lot of um information

1040
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,640
visuals as in her narrative, right? Like

1041
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:22,160
about the 60s in MIT. And I really

1042
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,520
wanted to know more about

1043
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,240
what that space was like, what um who

1044
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,680
was there, like what was the political

1045
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,280
context around her, what was the

1046
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,560
institutional context around her. So um

1047
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,160
that's what kind of brought me to this

1048
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,480
project.

1049
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,240
Um

1050
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,760
okay, wait, sorry, I'm still trying.

1051
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,760
Okay. So, uh I I have to really thank

1052
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,320
Tara for sending me this picture because

1053
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,800
I had a clipping of it from the Boston

1054
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,440
Herald, but I didn't have this picture

1055
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,560
until um till until we started

1056
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,359
communicating over email. And um so I'm

1057
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,040
going to This is a picture of my mom and

1058
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,440
then an audio. So, let's see. Wait, can

1059
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,440
can you guys hear my audio if I share

1060
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,440
this?

1061
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,960
Wait, did you hear that?

1062
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,800
>> No, I think you have to select to share

1063
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,480
audio as well. [laughter]

1064
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,040
>> Okay, hold on one second. I'm gonna do

1065
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,560
this thing where

1066
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,560
stop. Do it again.

1067
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,640
Okay. Yeah, I see. Share sound.

1068
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,800
Okay,

1069
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,800
back it up a little.

1070
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,960
I was at MIT uh in 1962. Started uh my

1071
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,480
master's degree and finished that in

1072
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,200
1964.

1073
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:13,440
And right after that I started uh to be

1074
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,760
in a PhD curriculum until

1075
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,240
December 1967.

1076
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,200
It is a department of food science,

1077
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,040
nutrition and food science.

1078
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,560
All I know was there not many women in

1079
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,800
MIT but in that department were at least

1080
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,119
six Filipina.

1081
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:39,040
Yeah. Oh, at this that same time that I

1082
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:44,240
was there, me first and then uh Mina and

1083
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:48,720
then Lita, Mina, Lydia, and then uh

1084
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:52,269
Hilda came. So, we're all five. Who Who

1085
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,269
did I Oh, me. [laughter]

1086
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:01,599
Counteracting the limitation of being a

1087
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,240
short Asian woman.

1088
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,720
Uh,

1089
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,319
I just smiled and everybody liked me

1090
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,640
smiling

1091
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,440
and actually

1092
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,760
for the longest time he said I everybody

1093
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,920
just said I'm the most innocent person

1094
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,744
they know. So they don't cor they don't

1095
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,744
want to corrupt me. [laughter]

1096
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,440
This I mean I think is a sexual advances

1097
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,000
or so I just ignore them. So they think

1098
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:36,480
that I'm just didn't know

1099
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:42,960
even in my my uh oral my uh my final

1100
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:46,079
oral uh defense of my dissertation.

1101
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,520
Uh after I passed

1102
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,440
one of the professors said you are the

1103
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,319
prettiest

1104
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,800
PhD I have known

1105
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,800
is a put down

1106
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,119
you know like

1107
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,280
did they pass me because I was pretty is

1108
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:08,119
that what's this implying

1109
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,119
they can't help it I have no idea

1110
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,040
>> so that's it

1111
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,280
I So either so there are so many things

1112
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,800
you know socially advances you ignore

1113
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:27,720
it. This comment sticks to my brain but

1114
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,720
I just one ear in the other ear out.

1115
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,240
So yeah it sounds like MIT was hard.

1116
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,240
>> [laughter]

1117
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,119
>> It sounds like the 60s might have been

1118
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,119
hard but especially in uh STEM like

1119
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:46,160
science, technology, engineering,

1120
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:49,280
mathematics and that is what I found out

1121
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,800
in the archives too. And so one of the

1122
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,000
things that uh that I I'm even this is

1123
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,760
an antidote. So so I I love that this

1124
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,400
this photo was sent to me. Um, one of

1125
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,000
the things that stuck out was this was

1126
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,160
this would have been kind of hard to

1127
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,560
find if if if archavists were not on it

1128
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,359
because

1129
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,000
the reporter, the photojournalist wrote

1130
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,920
my mom's name wrong. [laughter] So, the

1131
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,240
captain says, "Miss Gloria Capo Capco is

1132
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,720
her name." Um, and then you can see

1133
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,720
multiple different spellings here.

1134
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:32,640
Gloria Copco with an O. Anyway,

1135
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,880
it's not it's one thing that you know

1136
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,800
like to to find a photo. It's another

1137
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,400
thing to to actually find it in

1138
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,560
somewhere, right? And it to be

1139
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,680
preserved, but it to be cataloged

1140
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,160
correctly, it to be remembered.

1141
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,760
So, I do think that part of my artwork

1142
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:55,200
is this way of trying to remember the

1143
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:59,119
things that we might not be able to um

1144
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:04,160
the things that might uh get forgotten.

1145
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:07,200
But I think it's also about um for us

1146
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,599
looking back to to

1147
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,839
heal the moments that need to be held,

1148
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:19,119
you know, because there's a lot of um

1149
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:21,760
grief in that in that in that uh

1150
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:26,079
invisibility, right?

1151
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,839
Um so anyway, so that's that's how I got

1152
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,040
here. And so this is where I'm going,

1153
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,800
right? is that I do think the idea of

1154
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,280
the short film that I'm making for this

1155
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,160
fellowship is informed by my mom's

1156
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,000
story, but it it's about trying to find

1157
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,839
what are the other resilient stories out

1158
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,720
there um and how do I find other women

1159
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:50,560
of color, black women, Native American

1160
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,359
women, Latinx women out there doing um

1161
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:59,440
hard work of trying to be scientists or

1162
00:46:53,359 --> 00:47:02,480
engineers. Um, so in in the actual daily

1163
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,800
of trying to look for these stories, um,

1164
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,760
what I found was similar to what Tara

1165
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,319
started us off with, which was that the

1166
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,960
first black woman to to graduate was

1167
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:17,280
1968, right? Um, that in general, these

1168
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,359
stories are kind of hard to find, so

1169
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:24,800
similar to Jamie. Um, so I I I really

1170
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,920
sort of lend I went down all kinds of

1171
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,680
different um pathways to get different

1172
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:35,440
places. Um but some of those pathways

1173
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:40,560
actually were kind of um surprising like

1174
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:42,720
um in the 60s what I found um was that a

1175
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,640
lot of

1176
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,480
a lot of the sort of intern like I went

1177
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,240
down this sort of rabbit hole around

1178
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,599
international students and trying to

1179
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,359
find stories about international

1180
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:58,000
students but instead found out that the

1181
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,800
center of international affairs got

1182
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,160
started

1183
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,359
in in the 60s, which is actually kind of

1184
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:09,359
a huge um think tank to to continue the

1185
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:11,200
war in Vietnam and and other uh Asian

1186
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,440
countries. And so so that just kind of

1187
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,800
contextualizes what the social space

1188
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:24,400
MIT's taking up in this moment, right?

1189
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:28,400
Um, so I did I did lean into a lot of um

1190
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,240
really looking hard at what are

1191
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,920
uplifting stories. Again, I'm trying to

1192
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,319
find resilient stories. And so one of

1193
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,599
the things that I found to be completely

1194
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:41,119
inspiring is the work that came out of

1195
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:45,280
1994's conference um black women in the

1196
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:49,520
academy defending our name um 1894 to

1197
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:52,640
1994. And this was a conference that was

1198
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,359
um organized by Robin Kilson

1199
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,800
and Evelyn Hammonds who were both um

1200
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:01,520
assistant professors at MIT at the time.

1201
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:06,400
Um and

1202
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:10,000
this uh conference is really

1203
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:14,800
just delightfully documented. So there's

1204
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,200
um all the keynote speakers um are have

1205
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,160
videotaped were videotaped and are

1206
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,440
digitally accessible. So feel free to to

1207
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:27,440
watch it whenever you want. Um Angela

1208
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:31,680
Davis was keynote speaker. Um there were

1209
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:34,800
uh so many powerful women in attendance.

1210
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,920
Um, but I really want to give um props

1211
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,839
to Robin Kilson and Evelyn Hammonds um

1212
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:45,599
for the visionary uh just leadership to

1213
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:48,079
to think about this conference. Um and

1214
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,920
they even admit in their opening that

1215
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,640
they've never done this. This is not

1216
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,359
they're not conference organizers.

1217
00:49:52,640 --> 00:50:01,599
um they expected

1218
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:04,880
um maybe 500 people to show up. 2010

1219
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:08,240
people came to this conference.

1220
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:12,079
Yeah. From around the world.

1221
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:16,480
Um, and so I do think that these moments

1222
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:21,119
um really are about how do we create

1223
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:25,520
spaces um for dialogue to happen for for

1224
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:29,119
people to develop collective action

1225
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,720
together, collective um language,

1226
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,280
collective

1227
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,000
um

1228
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:40,240
in and grievances is it starts but but

1229
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:44,480
also to to find solutions together. Um,

1230
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,880
so I really leaned heavily into this and

1231
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,480
I just I do think that I just want to

1232
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,520
share this really sweet clip because um

1233
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,280
let's see if this

1234
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:59,119
>> So on behalf of all of us,

1235
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:02,079
I would like to ask

1236
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,559
Robin and Evelyn to come on stage again

1237
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,079
because I want to thank them in a proper

1238
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,765
way.

1239
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,765
Heat. [applause]

1240
00:51:15,915 --> 00:51:17,935
[applause]

1241
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,450
Heat. [applause]

1242
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,310
>> [cheering]

1243
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,550
[applause]

1244
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:48,319
>> Um,

1245
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:50,880
I I think when I when I'm sort of going

1246
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:54,000
through these archives, uh, what I what

1247
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,240
I've really noticed was the different

1248
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
feelings I was getting from looking at

1249
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,920
different sources, different things, And

1250
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,960
um I really wanted to stay with this

1251
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:09,040
moment because it really captured the

1252
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:13,359
feeling of celebration of honoring

1253
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:16,480
people who are um

1254
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,920
who are taking risks to to make space

1255
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:24,480
for community in a different way. Um, I

1256
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:26,400
think uh we I don't know if everyone

1257
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,920
here knows Angela Davis's work, but

1258
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,559
Angela Davis is, you know, an important

1259
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,440
um person that I've been following

1260
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,920
since, you know, I was a teenager, so

1261
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,400
probably around this time. And, you

1262
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,480
know, I don't I didn't but I don't know

1263
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,800
Robin Kilson's name and I don't know

1264
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,319
Evelyn Hammond's name before this um

1265
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,079
fellowship. And I think that's really

1266
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:52,800
important to say that that even in um a

1267
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,680
feminist space or or a radical space

1268
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,760
that we we tend to have um some

1269
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,280
celebrities, you know, people that we we

1270
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,599
hear again and again and again. And I I

1271
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,920
want to like really spend time, you

1272
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:09,760
know, giving flowers to the people that

1273
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:12,800
are are doing the work um that might not

1274
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,680
be known as much. So, um what I would

1275
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,640
love, uh for this [snorts] film is to

1276
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,400
continue down this this

1277
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,240
um

1278
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:28,240
path of thinking about

1279
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:30,160
this conference. Um I I'm going to shout

1280
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,800
out a friend of mine who's on here, Amy

1281
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:37,359
Angiri, who who was who was at the

1282
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,079
conference. Um, and I would I would love

1283
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,319
to to like really think about the ways

1284
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,960
that um we capture stories that are

1285
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,440
outside of the archives as well. Um, so

1286
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,520
I'm I'm excited to sit down with them

1287
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,319
and have a conversation about the impact

1288
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,599
of the conference um had on their life,

1289
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:59,760
but also um people like Robin Kilson,

1290
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:04,520
who was one of their mentors. Um,

1291
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,520
so that's that's coming. Um

1292
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,160
the other the other thing I will say

1293
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,640
that came out of this research is really

1294
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,119
thinking about um I said this in the

1295
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:21,280
conference in in relationship but like

1296
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:25,680
what are spaces that allow for us to

1297
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:30,800
find each other to find uh ways out of

1298
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:33,760
um what seems from Jaime's narratives is

1299
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,800
these depressive like situations, you

1300
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,319
know, like whether whether it's um my

1301
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,040
mom's story saying, you know, like

1302
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:45,680
advisor giving her a sexist comment, you

1303
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:49,520
know, at a at a moment of of celebration

1304
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:52,000
really. And or and so I'm thinking about

1305
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,680
the spaces of MIT a lot when I'm like

1306
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,079
going through the buildings and all that

1307
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,280
stuff. And one of the things that my mom

1308
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,280
highlighted was the Cheney room. So I I

1309
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,880
I'm like sort of piecing all these

1310
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,559
things together and then I want to

1311
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:10,160
visually share with you what I've been

1312
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:13,040
working on. So when I was um not in um

1313
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:17,040
when I wasn't in the archives, I was at

1314
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:20,800
the makers lab in the basement of MIT um

1315
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,319
cutting out 16mimeter films. And um part

1316
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,800
of this is just me doing some

1317
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,800
experiments myself of of experimental

1318
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,040
film practice. So, I'm going to share

1319
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,520
with you some possibility of like what

1320
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,760
that visual could look like for for

1321
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:38,160
these stories of like thinking about

1322
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,839
spaces, but also like how to use I can

1323
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,839
Yeah, we'll we'll I'll get back to it,

1324
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:44,319
but let me share with some like

1325
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,800
conceptual visuals that will will pull

1326
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,920
this together a little bit. So on behalf

1327
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,119
of all

1328
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,640
>> okay this

1329
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:58,400
so as you see here this is just um me

1330
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:01,280
animating the the film strips that I've

1331
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,839
um put together and I've looped on top

1332
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,480
of pictures of the Cheney room. Oops,

1333
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:10,720
sorry. Um

1334
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:14,000
so there you go. One more time.

1335
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:19,280
And so you I took the laser cutter and

1336
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:24,240
we cut f frame by frame uh holes into

1337
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:27,040
this um film. And this idea I'm going to

1338
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,440
use continually to be the mask of like

1339
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,359
the feeling of trying to find things

1340
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,079
that you know um may may you know may

1341
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:39,200
may be there may may not be there where

1342
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:41,040
where there is stories. Um, and it seems

1343
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,599
like the Cheney Room, uh, for those of

1344
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,799
you who are not familiar with MIT is

1345
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,200
this women's lounge that has been around

1346
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:52,880
for a long time, [laughter]

1347
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:56,319
hundred years or more. And um,

1348
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,640
uh, my mom talked about it as being like

1349
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,200
the when the first year she came, she

1350
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,000
used it a lot to sleep and just relax

1351
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,440
and to kind of feel a little bit of

1352
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,559
comfort um, and relief. and it's still

1353
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:16,400
around today and so I was able to visit.

1354
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:19,680
Um so yeah um the last thing that I want

1355
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,839
to say is that um I just wanted to show

1356
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,640
the faculty

1357
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:29,040
because I did go down this other route

1358
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:30,400
which is that one of the um most famous

1359
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,079
women who really are fighting for

1360
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,400
women's rights especially in STEM at MIT

1361
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:39,520
is Nancy Hopkins. And I did go down the

1362
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,040
rabbit hole of Nsky Hopskin story. Um,

1363
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,040
but I think it's important for us to

1364
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:47,280
contextualize also women of color

1365
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:49,680
specifically. Um, when that conference

1366
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,000
was being held in 1994, there were three

1367
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:56,160
black professors, black women professors

1368
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,640
at MIT. There's now 16,

1369
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:04,720
which is better, but not great, right?

1370
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:07,839
Still. So um so yeah just just

1371
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:12,400
continually uh thinking about the space

1372
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:15,280
of MIT, the space of academia, but also

1373
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,920
thinking about um what are the stories

1374
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,760
we want to be collecting? Um what are

1375
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,720
the solutions we want to be thinking

1376
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,559
about? Um that's really where this film

1377
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:29,119
is going.

1378
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:32,240
Um, some of that is also finding um,

1379
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:35,359
earth story accounts of attendance of

1380
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:39,920
people um, like Amy, but also uh, other

1381
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:42,640
academics like uh, uh, Cadia um, Hartman

1382
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,319
was at the conference too and writes

1383
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,160
about it and um, has a lot of good uh,

1384
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,920
questions for us to be thinking about

1385
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:57,040
which is like how how if you're fighting

1386
00:58:51,920 --> 00:59:01,599
for um, space in institutions like MIT.

1387
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:04,160
Do we not um forget to to also think

1388
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,880
about working class thinking about

1389
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,040
abolition? That was a huge thing for

1390
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,319
Angela Davis's speech is like how do we

1391
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:15,839
think about uh women in prison as well

1392
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:18,079
like how do we never leave behind anyone

1393
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:22,160
ever even when we're fighting for

1394
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:24,799
science and STEM careers, you know? And

1395
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:28,640
so I think that that's something that um

1396
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:32,640
I will be coming back to as part of the

1397
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,880
solution to to thinking about um the

1398
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,520
best way to capture

1399
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:41,119
uh resilient stories is really thinking

1400
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,680
about intersectionality and and tactics

1401
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,680
toward coalition.

1402
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,559
Um

1403
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:51,520
that's it.

1404
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:57,640
I'm going to throw in some links that uh

1405
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,640
that I that I would um

1406
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:05,680
Great. Thank you both so much for

1407
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:09,520
talking about your projects. Um

1408
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:12,079
these were both fascinating. I hadn't

1409
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:15,440
heard any of this. I knew the things you

1410
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:17,599
all were working on, but this was really

1411
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,839
a delightful to hear about your

1412
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,359
research. Um,

1413
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,559
I really appreciate how different the

1414
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,160
two projects are, but how they show the

1415
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,440
variety of ways that like these rich

1416
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:34,240
historical materials can be used. Um,

1417
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:36,240
and they highlight the value of the use

1418
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,920
of historical collections in ways that

1419
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,760
aren't like traditional scholarly

1420
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,640
papers. Um, and I think that's really

1421
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,359
cool.

1422
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,960
one question I had. I'll I'll start with

1423
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,480
the first question and then if people

1424
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,000
have questions, you can put them in the

1425
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,240
chat or you can just ask them since

1426
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,839
we're a small enough group that you can

1427
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,400
just unmute yourself and ask a question

1428
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:58,720
if you'd like. Um, had either of you

1429
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:02,000
done historical or like archival

1430
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:05,640
research before or was this a new

1431
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,640
experience for you?

1432
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,359
Yeah, I'll jump in. Um I had but never

1433
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:15,200
with oral interviews. I'd worked mostly

1434
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,880
with um like actual written texts like

1435
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,960
people's diaries entries or journals or

1436
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,960
published books before. So that part was

1437
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,960
new.

1438
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,760
Yeah. I realized in the process of this

1439
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:32,079
that I've been going to archives

1440
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:34,400
specifically um starting in undergrad um

1441
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,880
to really look at films and film

1442
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,839
archives and try to do my own archival

1443
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,799
producing of for documentaries I was

1444
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,799
thinking about and working on.

1445
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,359
Yeah.

1446
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:08,079
plenty of questions if nobody else does.

1447
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:11,359
Um, but please feel free to jump in with

1448
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,119
a question or a comment if you have one.

1449
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:16,000
Um,

1450
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:19,920
oh, good. You put a link to your trailer

1451
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,280
in the chat. Thank you, Liz. Um,

1452
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,240
I was wondering

1453
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,040
I know that there were sort of some

1454
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,440
changes in direction for both of you

1455
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:35,200
from your like original proposals to

1456
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,880
what came out of it. And I think

1457
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,319
there's

1458
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,079
first a comment and then a question. Um,

1459
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,160
I think that there's something about

1460
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,119
archival research that's really similar

1461
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:49,440
to like the creative act where like what

1462
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,720
you think you're going for isn't like

1463
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:55,359
necessarily what you're able to get to.

1464
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,160
Um, I was wondering if either of you had

1465
01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:02,319
any I know you both sort of touched upon

1466
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,960
like a lack of information. Um but if

1467
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:07,119
there's anything you want to expand upon

1468
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,359
talking about that um because there were

1469
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:12,000
I think quite a few gaps that both of

1470
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:14,319
you experienced.

1471
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,240
>> Yeah, I can I can start it off on that

1472
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:22,160
which is that like I really I made sure

1473
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:25,119
to go to MIT to be at the archives. um

1474
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:28,319
that for me is really important partly

1475
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:30,720
because I'm so visual and I want to be

1476
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,720
in the space that I'm making things. So

1477
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,760
it was actually also part of my film

1478
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,680
making practice. Um, but one of the

1479
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,119
things that really struck me was when I

1480
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,960
was saying I was trying to find anything

1481
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:45,119
like I don't know. I was just looking up

1482
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,640
like how do I find these Filipinos that

1483
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,720
my mom talks about, you know, [laughter]

1484
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:52,079
like I was just like sort of having like

1485
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,359
I know they're there but the archives

1486
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,640
doesn't feel like they're there, you

1487
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:58,480
know? And I think that that's something

1488
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:00,480
that really strike struck me. And then

1489
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,440
what really also struck is like the

1490
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,760
prolle of terrible things that I didn't

1491
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,520
want to read necessarily.

1492
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,280
um that because I because I couldn't

1493
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,799
find that I would go down these other

1494
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,079
routes that I were like let me

1495
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:17,839
contextualize the 1960s and like I you

1496
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,039
know that's when I started learning

1497
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:23,440
about certain academic professors that

1498
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,920
were you know like people's papers that

1499
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,319
I didn't necessarily want to be reading

1500
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,960
um that were like about cold war

1501
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:35,359
strategy or you know like be you know

1502
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:38,000
like um I one of the foreign affairs

1503
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:39,839
professors really hated all Chinese

1504
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,240
people and really thought that they

1505
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:46,000
shouldn't govern themselves. [laughter]

1506
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:48,799
It was pretty wild and um that's feels

1507
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,319
like a legacy of MIT too, you And I

1508
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:53,839
think it's important for us to be

1509
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:56,960
talking about those um parts of the

1510
01:04:53,839 --> 01:05:00,559
archives and these institutions that for

1511
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:03,839
me what I walked away with is that um I

1512
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:06,000
can't ignore like there's part of me

1513
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,720
that is not part of I'm not in the

1514
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,240
academic world in the way that um that

1515
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:15,119
my mom was or even as Robin or Evelyn

1516
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:17,680
were. But what I would say is that we

1517
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:22,079
can't ignore what's going on there

1518
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:25,839
because it's where empire begins. It's

1519
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:29,839
like where the like intellectual thought

1520
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:34,640
partners of everything really starts.

1521
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,559
And so um and and for MIT that is uh at

1522
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,799
the forefront of biotech, that's the

1523
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,960
forefront of military industrial

1524
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:42,960
complex, the medical industrial complex.

1525
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,079
like we want we really need to think

1526
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,280
about what's being thought there both

1527
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:51,599
historically and currently. Um, and

1528
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,799
that's what I hope my work to kind of

1529
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:58,960
also bring out is is a little bit of

1530
01:05:54,799 --> 01:06:02,400
this dialectic of like what's being

1531
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:06,000
emerges outside of that to to sort of

1532
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,960
counteract that, but also what should we

1533
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,799
be thinking about? Because what I really

1534
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,359
walked away with that I'm living in the

1535
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:16,880
imagination of somebody from the 1960s

1536
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:20,160
like whoa. Like that's wild. like that

1537
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:23,680
some white dude really just thought

1538
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:26,240
about social media and now

1539
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:31,799
we're in it. [laughter]

1540
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,799
So that really struck me.

1541
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:38,799
And then um for me I really had to stop

1542
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:41,839
and think about what people find

1543
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:42,960
important to include. Um and I think

1544
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:45,599
there's definitely a difference like

1545
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,599
when outside sources decide like which

1546
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,880
um you know which books to preserve or

1547
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:52,640
like which uh documents but I for

1548
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,319
example I was going through Janet

1549
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,799
Murray's papers and so the things that

1550
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:58,079
she had decided um to keep and I like

1551
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:02,079
the entire papers from her entire time

1552
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:04,319
at MIT um and I found it very

1553
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,880
interesting I think just like from her

1554
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:09,680
she had boxes and boxes and boxes but

1555
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,640
almost no nothing personal no real

1556
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,079
personal correspondence. Um, no, not

1557
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:18,799
even really like notes to sell for

1558
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:21,039
letters. Um, and but there were almost

1559
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:22,559
endless boxes of like programmer notes

1560
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,039
and just like the same draft of the same

1561
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,680
couple projects over and over again. Um,

1562
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,280
and since then I've also looked at other

1563
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,319
people's like collections of papers at

1564
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,760
other um, uh, universities and there

1565
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,200
were a lot more personal things, a lot

1566
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,400
more like back and forth notes, a lot

1567
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,520
more just like notes to yourself or

1568
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,880
things you've scribbled down or like

1569
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,000
different handwritten drafts, a lot more

1570
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,680
personal. I just found it interesting

1571
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,880
like neither way is good or bad. And I

1572
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,799
just kind of wonder about the mindset of

1573
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,280
the person who decides, okay, this is

1574
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:48,960
what I want to keep or maybe this is

1575
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,079
what I want to keep and have university

1576
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,200
to have. And maybe she has her own

1577
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,240
personal thing like somewhere else that

1578
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,480
she doesn't want to have, which is like

1579
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,720
fine. Um, but I like those really asking

1580
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,720
those questions.

1581
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:15,039
I think Jayen maybe has a question. If

1582
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:18,719
you wanna pop in, please feel free.

1583
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:20,799
>> Uh yes, I do. Hi. Uh

1584
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,159
both of you are I want to say how how

1585
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,600
incredibly interesting your projects

1586
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:25,920
sound and how cool it is that you were

1587
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,880
sharing with us. I have a question a

1588
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,480
little odd in nature, I suppose. How do

1589
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,440
you balance being informed about the

1590
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,600
history of MIT and not being overwhelmed

1591
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,279
or disheartened by the history of the

1592
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,880
place, the realities that the women in

1593
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,319
the past faced while also realizing that

1594
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,600
it can be difficult to carry all that

1595
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:48,640
knowledge? Uh I know you mentioned

1596
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,719
briefly in your presentation uh loose

1597
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,199
your name that you didn't want to go

1598
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,640
down the rabbit holes of some of the

1599
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:57,440
more negative stories and I just want to

1600
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,440
know how you balance that in your the

1601
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:03,480
stories you present and in your projects

1602
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,480
themselves. Thank you.

1603
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,880
Yeah, I mean I think I think similar to

1604
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,440
what I just said is that sometimes we

1605
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,440
have to share the negative stories to

1606
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,880
give the context to the other stories if

1607
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:22,319
that makes sense. So um

1608
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,480
yeah, even starting off this

1609
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,799
presentation with that little clip from

1610
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:31,040
my mom like that I know that you know

1611
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:32,880
her time at MIT wasn't negative the way

1612
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,600
that story is. you know, it's just that

1613
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,120
like that's what came up when she

1614
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,319
thought about counteracting the

1615
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:42,000
limitations. Like what are the

1616
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:46,640
limitations? The limitations are that um

1617
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,719
often the people around us um don't are

1618
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,799
are the limitations [laughter]

1619
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,120
basically, but the oppressive nature of

1620
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:55,360
the of the institution or the people

1621
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:00,000
around us with power are the

1622
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:02,560
limitations. But um but yeah um some I

1623
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,480
think that that's the the I would say

1624
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,880
the thing that I've learned from the

1625
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:09,840
archive experience is though that like

1626
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,760
when you put out of when you put out a

1627
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,360
request for a box of things you don't

1628
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,520
know what's going to come back, right?

1629
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,080
Like it's not it's a little bit of a

1630
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,840
surprise and sometimes that surprise is

1631
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:23,199
like um part is is part of the work

1632
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,120
though. It's part of the work of like

1633
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,520
shifting through all the other things

1634
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:30,640
that you like I literally would go

1635
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,640
through like a box of just like a to a

1636
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,199
toz you know like just to be like what's

1637
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,760
in here you know and trying to find

1638
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:39,679
something like unusual or interesting or

1639
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,400
as Jamie was saying with like you know

1640
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,400
the personal story potentially like that

1641
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,320
that maybe somebody left something in

1642
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,440
the margins of the paper to like to

1643
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,440
actually look more at you know um or

1644
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:56,440
maybe this person knows this person that

1645
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:56,440
will and lead me to another person.

1646
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:04,320
Uh and for me in terms of uh like how to

1647
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:07,440
bear it all the weight of the dark side

1648
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,679
of MIT and everything um that I've

1649
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,320
uncovered during the research process I

1650
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:15,600
think at least for me emotionally um

1651
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:18,400
what helped a lot were that in the same

1652
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,360
oral interviews where they had talked

1653
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,880
about something really dark and

1654
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,320
terrible, they also talked about either

1655
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,159
how they surmounted that or like they

1656
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,280
gave like a funny anecdote or something.

1657
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,320
Um, and it made me think I think about

1658
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,840
how it is terrible, but people are

1659
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,320
pushing against it. And also life goes

1660
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,840
on, like it's terrible, but people, I

1661
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,120
don't know, have existed and are

1662
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,800
existing and are pushing against it. And

1663
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,800
a lot of women um that were in the

1664
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,880
interviews talked about how when they

1665
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,159
were at MIT, even if, for example, there

1666
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,239
wasn't necessarily a lot of solidarity

1667
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,679
among women, one woman talked about um

1668
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,280
how they kind of just either didn't

1669
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:50,320
think of themselves as women or they

1670
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,560
just like wanted to like put their heads

1671
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,000
down like get through it. um but then

1672
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,199
after that had like joined women's

1673
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,719
associations and then were like now

1674
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,480
giving money back and like now like

1675
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,440
actively trying to work um and so the

1676
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,960
same women that had been put down and

1677
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,159
discriminated during their time at MIT

1678
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,239
are now actively working against that

1679
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:08,239
and working to make it a better place um

1680
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,840
in a lot of regards and so for me that

1681
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,920
gave me sounds cliche but that did give

1682
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,520
me a little bit of hope um I think

1683
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,719
especially yeah looking at how and I

1684
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,400
know it's also cliche to say like oh it

1685
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:19,760
was so much worse back then um so I

1686
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,199
think some ways worse some ways better

1687
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,640
like I'm not going to like fit value

1688
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:24,880
judgment, but I do think there's a lot

1689
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,320
of active work being done. Um, and

1690
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,159
looking at that work and the people who

1691
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:32,520
have been working and are still working.

1692
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:32,520
I have hope in those people.

1693
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,239
>> Um, we have one question in the chat and

1694
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,000
then Amy and then we probably have time

1695
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:39,840
for one more after that if anyone else

1696
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,600
wants them. So, I'll read the chat

1697
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,280
question, you two can respond and then

1698
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,440
Amy, you can hop in and ask your

1699
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,760
question. The question in the chat is

1700
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,120
for Jamie and Loose. How much of your

1701
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,520
research involves written

1702
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,199
accounts/recorded media versus oral

1703
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,000
history? And how are the oral

1704
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:58,960
recollections different from like

1705
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,960
recorded?

1706
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,880
I can jump in this time. Um, for this

1707
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,880
one, I started with written, but then I

1708
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,199
moved over to only oral. Um, so I looked

1709
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,800
at just or primarily the oral histories.

1710
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:12,960
Um, I found the oral histories much less

1711
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,560
edited, which I liked. Um they like

1712
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,239
especially the earlier ones that they

1713
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,600
done I think in like the 90s they left

1714
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:19,040
in all the ums they left in the weird

1715
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,800
pauses. They left in people like

1716
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,159
breaking in um and they left in like

1717
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,600
starting the tape, stopping the tapes.

1718
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:26,640
Like they wrote that in and it was very

1719
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,760
raw and I liked that a lot. Um and so I

1720
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,760
think and there was a lot of laughter

1721
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,719
and there was a lot of back and forth um

1722
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,239
because they would also have the

1723
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,920
interviewer talk about themselves which

1724
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,199
in the written accounts was a lot more

1725
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,199
straightforward and formal, a lot more

1726
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:38,800
formal register. Um so I feel like the

1727
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,320
oral histories I definitely got more of

1728
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,520
a sense of who each person was and I

1729
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,920
loved that. That's why I ended up going

1730
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,920
there specifically.

1731
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,920
>> I would say it's 50/50 with my research.

1732
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,679
I mean, a lot of the things that I came

1733
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:56,080
across that wasn't the conference was

1734
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:58,159
written. Um, that I looked at Nancy

1735
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,400
Hopkins papers and like read every

1736
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:02,159
letter that she sent [laughter] to back

1737
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,320
and forth and that was kind of really

1738
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:09,199
interesting. Um and then I also uh had

1739
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,960
an opportunity to look at um actually

1740
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,719
kind of the organizing of the oral

1741
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,239
history project was interesting to look

1742
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:19,520
at the lunchon transcript um is so

1743
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:22,080
interesting 19 you know like 75 them

1744
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,120
really thinking about all it was it was

1745
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,679
a lunchon to talk about the oral history

1746
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,600
project launching but then in that

1747
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,159
people sharing what else they were doing

1748
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,360
around equal you know basically like

1749
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:38,960
fighting for women's um professionally

1750
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:41,360
at MIT. And so there were what was cool

1751
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,600
and almost frustrating for me as a

1752
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:47,520
filmmaker and somebody who wants that

1753
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:49,520
archive video material is that they kept

1754
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,080
referencing all these films that I was

1755
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,320
like where are those? Where are those?

1756
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,800
And you know like and and that felt

1757
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:59,440
frustrating is like this sort of um you

1758
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,360
know this like you know what I want is

1759
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,000
the recorded material. like I do want

1760
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:06,640
the oral and I do want the video and and

1761
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,520
I'm sitting here looking at paper being

1762
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:13,040
like h this title will never exist or

1763
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:15,280
there was like this really awesome um

1764
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,719
anecdote they were saying that they they

1765
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:21,120
had a high school and like uh firstear

1766
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,880
students in acting doing like

1767
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:26,239
videotaping

1768
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:29,840
um workplace like harm basically and

1769
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:32,080
like and videotaping it as a way to kind

1770
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,320
of like skid it out but also feel

1771
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,239
empowered in situations to like come up

1772
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:40,320
with alternatives. That's what I mean.

1773
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:42,560
Like I would love to see that. And 1975

1774
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,480
that probably is like I don't even know

1775
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,560
what kind of format because that was

1776
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:51,560
like that was pretty BHS. So [laughter]

1777
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,560
yeah,

1778
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:02,800
my question is like L said, I was at

1779
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,719
this conference um and I have to say

1780
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,360
that I have I feel like the conference

1781
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,760
was very formative to me. It made me a

1782
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,560
scholar essentially. Now I'm like a full

1783
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:15,760
professor. But um and then I wasn't even

1784
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:18,080
in grad school I believe. But um I have

1785
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,640
to say MIT was not a welcoming space

1786
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:24,719
whatsoever. Um so I was really surprised

1787
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:26,640
that they had preserved this at all. Um

1788
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,800
and I don't I don't think you said loose

1789
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,040
but Robin Kilson tragically died really

1790
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,800
young of cancer. Um I think they had

1791
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,480
meant it to be an ongoing thing but it

1792
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,840
wasn't. I think there was another one

1793
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:39,760
but only two. But um I guess I mean this

1794
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,800
is a long prelude to my question which

1795
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,800
is what are and other people have kind

1796
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,320
of asked shades of this but I feel like

1797
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,000
what actually happened at that

1798
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,800
conference can't be captured in an

1799
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,239
archive cuz I feel like of all the

1800
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,880
people who were there I'm sure there

1801
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:56,960
were many many many people like me who

1802
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,400
were young and it made them a scholar or

1803
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,480
made them see the possibility of

1804
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,840
scholarship and in a way it doesn't

1805
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:05,760
surprise me that the first um black

1806
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,679
person graduated in ' 68. that's

1807
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,600
literally still in my lifetime, you

1808
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,280
know? So, it just wasn't a welcoming

1809
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,239
place. I don't find archives in general

1810
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:19,040
to be welcoming. So, I'm wondering like

1811
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:20,880
what is left out cuz I 100% don't think

1812
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:24,719
what happened at that conference, which

1813
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:26,159
was pure magic, was captured in that in

1814
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,520
the archives. But, of course, I haven't

1815
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:31,000
seen it, so I don't know. But I'm just

1816
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,000
curious about that.

1817
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:42,719
I mean, I think that

1818
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:45,199
it felt very like what I understand from

1819
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:50,560
even just reading people's accounts of

1820
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:53,280
it um that it that feeling and the level

1821
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,600
of energy that was brought at that

1822
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:58,320
conference was not captured. what was

1823
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,360
captured was the keynote speeches, the

1824
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:05,120
program. Um,

1825
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:07,040
I would really have loved uh what they

1826
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,040
did with the lunchon of the oral history

1827
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,679
to have existed for that conference.

1828
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:14,880
like I want to be a fly on the wall when

1829
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:17,280
Evelyn Hammonds and Robin Kilson are

1830
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,600
talking about the nitty-gritty of like

1831
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,760
you know how how did they make the

1832
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,679
decision to just keep letting people you

1833
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,280
know like this is so important that

1834
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,840
we're just going to keep thousand you

1835
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:30,000
know like that two we're at 2,000 people

1836
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,320
registered now like how like I want to

1837
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,239
know that nitty-gritty conversation but

1838
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,360
and maybe that will be the conversation

1839
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:40,080
I ask Evelyn Hammonds you know of of

1840
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:45,600
really like getting more clarity about

1841
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:47,920
um what are are the things that

1842
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,400
that conference did for people and for

1843
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:53,760
herself that um and I would love to hear

1844
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:58,159
from you Amy more. Um and for me I feel

1845
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:02,239
like the thing that um I really was

1846
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:03,679
reminded is that archives are not in the

1847
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,840
institutions, they're in our

1848
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:08,239
relationships. they're in the legacy

1849
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:11,920
that's left behind by people like Robin

1850
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:15,760
Kilson, right? Um I think I think it not

1851
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:18,400
coincidence that um that Amy was there

1852
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,960
and that now I get to talk to Amy um who

1853
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:23,600
was mentored by Robin. I I think that

1854
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:27,000
that's a full circle that I'm I'm really

1855
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,000
leaning into.

1856
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,440
>> And obviously I I can't speak on the

1857
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,679
specific conference, but thank you Amy

1858
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,159
um for your perspective and for bringing

1859
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,600
that up. Um, and I do think and it

1860
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:40,000
doesn't surprise me that MIT itself did

1861
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,840
not feel like a welcoming place. Um, and

1862
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,719
just the fact that they the first black

1863
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:48,000
student graduated in 1968. Um, but even

1864
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,840
so, that's what like 50 plus years,

1865
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,320
there were still only like two black

1866
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,880
accounts in the entire of all the oral

1867
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,159
histories. So, maybe they just didn't

1868
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,440
want to speak on their experiences or

1869
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,400
maybe they weren't asked because they

1870
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,760
weren't thought people thought like

1871
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,800
their perspectives weren't important. I

1872
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,320
don't know. But you're right, there's so

1873
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,239
many voices and so many things that

1874
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:08,480
aren't being captured that should be

1875
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:10,880
>> just one more thing real quick. But um

1876
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,800
because like the one thing for me was at

1877
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,920
my school there was one black female

1878
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,600
professor and um the weird thing that

1879
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,679
happened there was just actually seeing

1880
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,360
a bunch of black academics. Like I'd

1881
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,120
never seen that. And I don't think you

1882
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,640
can capture that in footage. Like I

1883
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:27,920
remember where I was sitting in that

1884
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:29,920
Angela Davis speech, you know, but like

1885
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,440
you can't capture the sense of like

1886
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,920
wonder of seeing a bunch of black

1887
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,840
academics in an archive. But anyway,

1888
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:40,560
I'll stop.

1889
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:43,679
>> No, I I agree. Archives are only part of

1890
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:47,120
the story. We usually just preserve sort

1891
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:48,880
of the records, the paperwork, letters,

1892
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,480
sometimes really cool, surprising,

1893
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,800
interesting notes, but it's certainly

1894
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:55,120
not like we need people who can

1895
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,360
interpret the history and who can do

1896
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,440
oral histories and like interact with

1897
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,440
people. And that's one of the special

1898
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,000
things I think about fostering a

1899
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,800
fellowship like the women at MIT

1900
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,280
fellowship where we're not just looking

1901
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,120
for people who can take

1902
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,640
something from one piece of paper and

1903
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:16,880
put it on another piece of paper, but

1904
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:18,880
people who can really help the um

1905
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,480
stories come alive and bring them to

1906
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,920
like a new generation of people and

1907
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,199
connect with people who were there. I

1908
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,440
mean, I think it's so cool that you were

1909
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:28,000
there. And then I know someone who was

1910
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:31,040
in one of the AMDA oral histories that

1911
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,960
Jamie used, she posted and she's she's

1912
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:38,760
also on this call. So, I think it's just

1913
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:38,760
a really a great way to see

1914
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,000
ways that archives can like still

1915
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:46,400
operate as part of the community even

1916
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,600
years after like an event has happened.

1917
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:51,280
But yeah, they in no way will ever be a

1918
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,960
way to capture the whole picture,

1919
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:58,159
especially if it was something pre

1920
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:01,199
cell phone era when like probably some

1921
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:04,800
parts were filmed that we don't have

1922
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:06,480
that maybe deteriorated or just were

1923
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:10,239
lost

1924
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:14,400
in the shuffle of time.

1925
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:16,560
Um well, thank you all so much for

1926
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,320
joining us. Thank you again, Jamie

1927
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:22,239
Eloose. Um, this is really awesome. I'll

1928
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:25,360
be putting

1929
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:26,880
this recording up on YouTube in the next

1930
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,960
couple of weeks and we'll send an email

1931
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,920
out to everyone who registered so that

1932
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:35,679
you all can watch it, pre-watch as you

1933
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:37,440
will. Um, and yeah, thank you all for

1934
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:40,440
coming and have a great rest of your

1935
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,440
day.
