1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,600
so here's an experiment this is a

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,520
checker board this is about perception

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,240
the brain sometimes plays tricks on us

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,240
and you see this object right here and

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,840
you see it cast a shadow so my question

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,759
to you is is the shade in square number

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,320
one the same as the shade in square

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,640
number two yes or no more people say no

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,600
okay so we have to train ourselves to do

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,320
this so this one is label number one

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,880
this is label number two I'm going to

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,000
Now cover

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,439
this and now you see that they both have

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,960
the same shape right so those of you who

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,760
said yes before probably have seen

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,520
this your brain is using the knowledge

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,520
that you had from before that's great

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
okay so let's look at this one more time

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
the shadow is telling the brain

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,399
something we have to develop the skills

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,879
and with our brains to sort out the

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,359
information and be very careful about it

23
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,760
so we have the proper interpretations

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:00,399
for more MIT moments from MIT open
