00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
An autonomous underwater vehicle is

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,000
basically like a drone. So the operating

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,240
environment is a little complex as

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,559
compared to uh surface vehicles and

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,480
aerial drones. But over the last few

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,880
years we are using new technological

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,640
advancements like 3D printing and high

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,880
power embedded computers to build

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,560
vehicles that are at a lower cost and

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,199
micro vehicles as compared to large

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
AUVs. So we can eventually use them in

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
swarms instead of just using one vehicle

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,679
for a specific mission. There are many

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
advantages for that. If you want a

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,920
monitor underneath a large ice shelf,

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
instead of using a single vehicle where

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
you can get a single measurement of a

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
single track, now you can use a network

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,320
of AUVs where you can get the temporal

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
and special variation of multiple areas

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,800
at the same time. So we can get more

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,719
information using a swarm instead of

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
using a single vehicle.
