9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,439
>> Anyway, uh today uh we have a guest

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,760
speaker who's the audio director for the

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,400
Singapore Academy.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,120
That's where we are. And um and he's

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,160
going to run through brainstorming uh as

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,760
an exercise. Um but we're not actually

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,280
planning out the game that you're going

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,280
to be doing for your first assignment in

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
this class. I think this is a you're

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
doing other

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,320
>> Yeah, these will just be just be

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
practice. So basically the the groups

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
there will be a group activity involved

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
in this but the the things that that

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,680
that you're working on don't have to be

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
the same groups that you will eventually

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,680
be using for your first assignment. The

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,359
idea is just sort of to get used to the

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
process of brainstorming and sort of a

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,600
general rules of thumb uh and before I

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159
spoil the entire talk.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,439
>> Yeah that's okay. So uh yeah just my

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,280
name is Apstein. A little bit of

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,600
background on myself. Um I'm the audio

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,439
director here. Uh I've been working in

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,439
sound design uh officially for uh a

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,159
number of years now, five some odd

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,000
years. Uh unofficially uh way longer

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,159
than that. Um uh doing TV TV and video

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
game sound design. And then uh and then

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,000
before that I I was a high school

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,600
teacher. Um and so I think you know to

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,240
the extent that um uh talking about kind

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,000
of creative collaboration uh I have a

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
fair amount of experience ranging even

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,399
back to to when I was uh teaching high

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,079
school for trying to uh encourage what

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,880
what we might call organized uh

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,799
ideiation. Um I guess first I'll I'll

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
thank you guys for for reading uh

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,840
reading the text. Um it is it is funny.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,399
it does have these kind of um I guess

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,040
now a little antiquated 1950s sort of

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,399
references and um you know some of his

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,360
uh some of his uh scientific evidence

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,760
for uh for for why brainstorming is good

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,000
is is not particularly well supported.

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,959
was like, "We got 95 ideas." And I was

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,720
like, "Well, how many ideas did you

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,840
get?" You know, doing it the other way

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,480
doesn't, you know, he doesn't tell you,

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,319
but hey, 95, that's a big number, you

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,520
know. So, um, you know, a little a

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,760
little bit of background about Alex

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
Osborne. He was, um, he was an

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,560
advertising, uh, executive. Um, and so

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
you can kind of see where brainstorming

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
and advertising is a is a creative

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
industry, right? It's a design industry.

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,080
And so getting multiple people in

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,120
interdisciplinary kind of you know

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,200
different skills working together um on

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
a on a creative project it can be a

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,959
challenge. Um and so you can see how

73
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,519
brainstorming came out of the work he

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
was doing in advertising. So um so just

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,480
to get started I I would say you know

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,800
you've read it so you have a sense but

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,120
but kind of forget what you think you

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,239
know brainstorming is. Um some of what

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,800
you think it is will apply. um some of

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,560
the most fundamental principles um to

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
brainstorming maybe you don't you don't

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
realize or you didn't realize until you

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
did the reading and and that's a little

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
bit of what I want to talk about. I

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,159
think the the foundation for his

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,480
brainstorming idea is actually really

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,840
solid and it's something something that

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,000
you know we should explore today. Um

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
why why brainstorming for video game

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,920
design um is an interesting question. Um

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,599
but I sort of touched on that a little

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,800
bit with relation to advertising, right?

93
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,640
I mean, we're talking about a creative

94
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,000
industry where you've got people with

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,560
various skill sets, whether they're

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,799
artists or sound designers or uh game

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,319
designers explicitly or producers. Um,

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,599
all of these people kind of existing in

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,720
a collaborative environment together.

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
They're bringing different things to the

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,200
table. How do you get them to to kind of

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
work together and and and be

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,480
collaboratively creative? And so this

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,239
is, you know, a first step in that

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,159
process. And so this is this is why

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
brainstorming is particularly useful um

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
for game design. And then the other

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,680
thing um the other thing that I I think

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,920
is important to understand and we'll

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,080
talk about it a bit more is is um the

111
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,799
kind of social pressures um that are

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,319
created in creative envir professional

113
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
creative environments even

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,040
non-professional actually I mean it it

115
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,799
would exist in an educational

116
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,200
environment too um you guys are all at

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,439
MIT it's one of the most prestigious

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,079
universities um you know in the world

119
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,120
right and so you're probably no stranger

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,400
to the idea of of kind of social

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,320
pressure in uh in the process of

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,240
ideiation, right? Um you sit there and

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,280
you say if I say this idea, am I going

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,919
to look like an idiot? Um and and

125
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,240
usually the outcome from that is if I

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,919
don't say anything, it's it's you know,

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
maybe I don't get the gain of presenting

128
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,680
a good idea, but I don't get the hit of

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
making a bad idea. And so it's like, you

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
know, self-preservation. It's like why

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,960
take the risk uh if if it's not worth

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
it. Um and so you know I think MIT is an

133
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,440
interesting place to talk about

134
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,320
brainstorming and and this kind of

135
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,720
organized ideation because there is you

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,120
know social and academic pressure here

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
too. Uh pressure to be right, pressure

138
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,560
to not say something that would seem

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,039
wrong and that sort of pressure is is

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,520
completely uh antithetical to the idea

141
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,000
of a brainstorming session. Um and so

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,199
that's that's kind of a a basis for why

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
not only it's good for video games but

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,520
why it's also good to talk about talk

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,479
about here at MIT. So

146
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,720
there are four uh basic principles of

147
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,720
brainstorming. Um you know these were

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,000
outlined by Alex Osborne. He he was an

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,400
ad agent. Um and uh I guess it was you

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
know early he says it was like 1938 when

151
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,520
he first started using it. People

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,160
started kind of talking about it since

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
then. Um and and it kind of I like when

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
he said it sort of spiraled out of

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
control that people sort of ran away

156
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,360
with it. They're like ah this is a great

157
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,479
idea but then they were they were kind

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,560
of practicing it wrong. Um and so uh you

159
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,800
know in in applied imaginations which is

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,639
where the text um you know you guys

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,160
read. It's sort of him reflecting on

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,320
this brainstorming idea and saying this

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,199
is really how it how it should be uh how

164
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,000
it should be exercised. Um the first

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,720
principle is single-handedly the most

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,400
important principle. Um and that's no

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,479
criticism. Um, that's a that's kind of a

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,560
blanket way of of saying it, but but

169
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,319
really in a more uh in a more um broad

170
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
sense, it's it's kind of saying uh you

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,440
know, judgment needs to be excluded. Um,

172
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,039
in some sense, it's kind of um kind of

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,479
both positive and negative, but but

174
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,639
especially you don't want to criticize

175
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160
each other's work. Um, you also don't

176
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
want to spend time during a brainstorm

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,639
session talking about how good an idea

178
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,199
is, right? If if someone throws out an

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
idea um and and someone's like, "Oh,

180
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,840
this is the best idea. We don't even

181
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
need to keep going anymore." Then it's

182
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,440
like, "Oh, no. Wait, now we're not

183
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,720
brainstorming anymore." Um and so

184
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,639
really, you know, judgment is is is

185
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,680
absolutely supposed to be excluded from

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,680
the process. Um

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,520
I think that uh this is the primary uh

188
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
principle that goes against that social

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
pressure, right? Because the social

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
pressure of judgment, the people who are

191
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
saying, whether you have an executive

192
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,240
who's in charge of you, a boss who's

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,360
saying whether or not the ideas are good

194
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
or bad, or whether you have colleagues

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
that are saying whether or not ideas are

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,440
good or bad, that sort of social

197
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,000
pressure that forces people to stay

198
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,280
quiet and maybe hold on to good ideas or

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,720
throw away good ideas. Um, you know, if

200
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,360
everybody's on board with the lack of

201
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,960
criticism, then you you kind of have

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,120
more freedom to to kind of express

203
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
yourself. Um, you know, just just kind

204
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,919
of pulling back to the text a little

205
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,639
bit, um, you know, there was this this

206
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,319
great quote um from this vice president.

207
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,919
I just I'll read to you guys again. Uh

208
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,440
you know, he said, "It was hard to get

209
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
through my head uh what you were trying

210
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
to do with us. Uh my 15 years of

211
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
conference after conference in my

212
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,720
company have conditioned me against

213
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,400
shooting while um almost all of us

214
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,639
officers rate each other on the basis of

215
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
judgment. Uh we are far more apt to look

216
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,919
up to the other fellow if he makes no

217
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
mistakes than if he suggests lots of

218
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
ideas." That's something that may sound

219
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
familiar to you. Um so I've always kept

220
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,639
myself from spouting any suggestions

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
which could be sneered at. uh I wish our

222
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,520
people would feel free to shoot ideas

223
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,520
the way we have been doing in these

224
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,360
brainstorm sessions. And so really like

225
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,840
um this this lack of criticism, this

226
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,199
sort of creating a safe environment for

227
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,240
ideiation um is is the most fundamental

228
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,759
principle in this brainstorm. Um and it

229
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
really goes right at those social

230
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,720
pressures which which can stop you know

231
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,879
creativity and really hamper creativity.

232
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Um any questions about that? That sort

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,400
of makes sense, right? This principle of

234
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,960
of no criticism. Cool. Um,

235
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,120
principle number two, uh, freewheeling,

236
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,879
as uh, Mr. Osborne likes to call it. The

237
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,080
wilder idea the better. This is also

238
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,680
hard, uh, to kind of get used to. Um,

239
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
again, it was like the guy said in that

240
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
quote, you know, you you resist the urge

241
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,919
to throw out something that's absolutely

242
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,479
crazy and absolutely wild for the fear

243
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,000
of ridicule. Well, if we eliminate the

244
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,440
fear of ridicule and we understand that

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
we're just trying to get every idea that

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,839
we can um then freewheeling is is

247
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,120
absolutely encouraged and you need to

248
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,040
kind of get past that um past that oh

249
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
you know this is whatever we're known

250
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,920
whatever like this um and I can you know

251
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,440
I I put up Kadamari dysi up here because

252
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,519
you know that that's the sort of idea

253
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,680
that someone throws out at a at a at a

254
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,720
meeting um and if there's criticism

255
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
someone will be like that's the dumbest

256
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
thing I've ever heard. you can't just

257
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,200
roll around picking up stuff for the

258
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,000
king of the cosmos. That's insane. Um

259
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,519
and and it probably, you know, it

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,880
probably was a synthesis of a lot of

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,080
different ideas that that kind of

262
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
created that game, which we'll talk

263
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
about later, but um really, you know,

264
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,680
having these like kind of wild, crazy

265
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,680
ideas. You may think it's over the edge,

266
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
and it might be over the edge. Um, but

267
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
it is it is way easier to make something

268
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,720
feasible than it is to take something

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,880
that's pretty um pretty normal and make

270
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
it make it innovative and interesting,

271
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,560
right? It's it's much easier to kind of

272
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,040
go go in that backward direction. Um,

273
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,959
and so really the wilder idea the idea

274
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,720
you can come up with the the the

275
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,240
stronger. Um,

276
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,560
any questions about principle number

277
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,839
two? Making sense on board? Cool. Uh,

278
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,120
quantity. Um, this is really the the

279
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,519
goal of of a brainstorming session. Come

280
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,920
up with as many ideas as you can, right?

281
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
Um, it it stands to reason that if you

282
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
have lots of ideas, there's a greater

283
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
likelihood that you'll have a useful one

284
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,839
um than if say you have two. Your

285
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,200
choices are limited. You didn't pick the

286
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
better of the two, I suppose, but it

287
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
might not be the best idea you have. Um,

288
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,200
and so really this is, you know, this

289
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
adds on to that wild idea. Throw

290
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,360
everything out you can. you need to just

291
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,040
get everything um out and everything on

292
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,800
on on the page um in order to even be

293
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,160
able to start judging it. And that's the

294
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
important thing too that that needs to

295
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,920
be um that needs to be clarified is that

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,160
brainstorming is a first step in a

297
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,920
creative process. It's not the whole

298
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
process. It's not like, oh, we've got

299
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
this creative problem that we need to

300
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,760
solve. We'll have a brainstorming

301
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
session, then we'll have it. Um, and

302
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
actually that's that's something that

303
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,760
hampers brainstorming a lot is that you

304
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
have the brainstorming session, you come

305
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,519
up with these great ideas and then

306
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
everybody leaves and you never return to

307
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,040
it or you never kind of reflect on which

308
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,399
of these ideas is going to be best or

309
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
you kind of just end up picking one. And

310
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,760
so the judgment needs to happen as well.

311
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,959
Um, but not now, you know, during the

312
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,480
brainstorm session. It's just get

313
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,240
everything out that you can. Um,

314
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
it it really just it kind of stands for

315
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
reason. And I I kind of made fun of

316
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,880
Storm when he was like, you know,

317
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,720
saying, well, in this inst in the

318
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,240
government they had 95 ideas and we you

319
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
know came up with eight good desires

320
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
which you know how many did you come up

321
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
with before but but it's true just the

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,160
more you have the better you're going to

323
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,760
do

324
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
and then this one is related to that

325
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,480
which is the idea of synthesis or

326
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,320
building on ideas um which is that often

327
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,240
times the best idea the best creative

328
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,560
idea is not going to be something that's

329
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,800
just kind of a unique idea that stands

330
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,480
alone in this corpus of ideas that

331
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
you've collected over the brainstorm

332
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,399
it's going to be an idea that is a

333
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,240
synthesis of of of one idea and another

334
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,600
or someone suggests an idea and then

335
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
that makes you think of something else

336
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
that's related to it and you kind of

337
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,480
build on that and and you can see in

338
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,720
really positive good brainstorming

339
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
sessions um there's momentum and one of

340
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,040
the things that can really hurt that

341
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,600
momentum is when people are starting to

342
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,720
riff on an idea then someone's like oh

343
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
but you know in other news you know we

344
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,160
could do this and so it's really

345
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,920
encouraged that you synthesize ideas if

346
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,240
you have that other left field idea

347
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,839
don't throw it away right jot it down so

348
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
that you can bring it up later but don't

349
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,519
don't kind of kill the momentum of the

350
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,040
synthesis if that's happening. Um it's

351
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,000
it's you know kind of really important

352
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,560
that you start um it's the collaborative

353
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,120
part of this creative uh ideiation. Um

354
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,800
it's this combining of ideas that's

355
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,200
going to create um good ideas. And

356
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,720
that's that's just um I I think we can

357
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,800
kind of take that as a given that if you

358
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,680
collect a bunch of skilled, thoughtful,

359
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,360
creative people together um combining

360
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,279
their ideas is going to create something

361
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,959
that's better than just the any one idea

362
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,120
that one creative uh professional is

363
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,040
going to have or at least just a

364
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,519
different solution that might be more

365
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,279
ideal given the problem. And so, you

366
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,839
know, you can think of things like, you

367
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,959
know, Lego's pretty awesome. Um, Star

368
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,800
Wars is also pretty awesome,

369
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,880
but you know, Lego Star Wars move is is

370
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,519
also awesome. You know, similarly, um,

371
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,240
you know, Marvel's dope. Um, Capcom's

372
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,959
also pretty dope. Marvel versus Capcom

373
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,959
is tremendously dope. So, um, you know,

374
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,720
building on ideas can create obviously

375
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,880
really interesting things and that's,

376
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,320
you know, it's a good idea to kind of

377
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,079
keep working on that in your brainstorm

378
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,360
sessions, like what can you what can you

379
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,120
put together? Um,

380
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
so how is it organized? Um, you know,

381
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,279
we've kind of talked about basic

382
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,880
principles. Any questions about those

383
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,120
four principles? Do they all make sense?

384
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:37,440
Do they all seem to be grounded in

385
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,360
the greatest? All right. Um,

386
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
so the question becomes then, how do you

387
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,200
organize um how do you organize your

388
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,279
brainstorm? One of the points that Alex

389
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
Osborne makes is that um it needs to

390
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,399
have a casual spirit or a casual

391
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,920
atmosphere. He refers to it as a picnic,

392
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,680
which is another one of those I haven't

393
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,160
been on a picnic in a really long time,

394
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,440
but um but you know, it's like yes, we

395
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,800
brought our lunches in and then we

396
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,880
talked afterwards. It's like what we

397
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,000
call those lunch meetings now. But um

398
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,600
but he has a good point that if um if a

399
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,079
large part of the brainstorming session

400
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,760
is intended to combat um social

401
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,839
pressures that stop you from being

402
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,440
creative, that inhibit your creativity,

403
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,000
then it would stand to reason that

404
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,800
creating a casual spirit, a casual

405
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,720
environment um for this process is

406
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,920
important. Um, and so I have, you know,

407
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,360
it's hard to most video game processes

408
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
and most video game companies have a

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,920
pretty casual spirit and environment

410
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,519
because of the nature of the work in

411
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,839
general. Um, so sometimes this might not

412
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,440
be that hard, but um, you know, things

413
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,279
to consider are like what is the makeup

414
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,760
of your team, right? If there's, you

415
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,680
know, if your president of the company

416
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,000
does a really bad job of putting himself

417
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,000
or herself on the same level as all the

418
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
people, you might want to exclude that

419
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,639
person from the brainstorming session

420
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,240
because then everybody's going to feel

421
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,000
the pressure of the president, you know,

422
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
and we, you know, do we need to make an

423
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,880
idea that makes that person happy. It's,

424
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,240
you know, you have to think these things

425
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
through in terms of what the environment

426
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
is going to be for your brainstorming

427
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,079
session and and who's involved. Um, so

428
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,360
it it is an important point is an

429
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:08,560
important step. um you know starting

430
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,519
with a a bad or or a worthless idea uh

431
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,000
encourages that freewheeling sense. Um

432
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,880
you know a lot of times people will

433
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,480
contribute ideas that feel safe. Again

434
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,360
you want to come up with the most ideas

435
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,120
that you can. Um so you know having

436
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,839
someone with the courage or even

437
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,279
bringing to the beginning of it a a

438
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,440
crazy worthless bad freewheeling idea

439
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,440
can help kind of encourage people to

440
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,880
keep doing that. So, um, you know,

441
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
either starting with someone who has a

442
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,920
crazy idea or even bringing it to the

443
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
brainstorm at the very beginning can be

444
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,399
a really good thing as well. Um, this is

445
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,440
kind of a key one. Don't uh don't

446
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,959
interrupt anyone. Um, it it's really

447
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
important in a brainstorming session to

448
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,360
encourage um that every voice is heard.

449
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,600
Um, you know, there's there's these kind

450
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,399
of uh let me see if I can find that

451
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,880
quote from that one guy. Um, yeah, here

452
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,079
we go. Um, it's great. I was think up or

453
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,360
think up or shut up.

454
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,920
>> Oh, well, yeah, there's that one, too,

455
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,440
which is a good one. Yeah, but um uh let

456
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,360
me just It's talking about the spirit of

457
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,279
a brainstorm session is important. Uh

458
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
self- encouragement is needed almost as

459
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,199
much as mutual encouragement. Uh a

460
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
perfectionism complex will throttle

461
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,040
effort and abort ideas. Uh he says, "One

462
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,720
of the ablest members kept mom

463
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,480
throughout one of our sessions. I button

464
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
hold him, never heard that expression,

465
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,519
afterward and begged him to spout

466
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,720
whatever ideas might come to his mind in

467
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,920
our next meeting." And this is this is

468
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
where it gets good. this is the, you

469
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,079
know, really able uh member of this ad

470
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,079
team. He says, "All right, I'll try."

471
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,759
Uh, but here's what happened. After our

472
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,880
first meeting, I jotted down about 15

473
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,480
ideas with the thought that I would

474
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,839
bring them to our next session. When I

475
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
looked them over, I decided they were

476
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
worthless, so I just tore up the list.

477
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,199
Um, and you know, Alice kind of goes on

478
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,639
to say, "It took a while to encourage

479
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,720
this guy to understand that there's no

480
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,880
such thing as a worthless idea. Um, that

481
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
that it can either be expanded upon or

482
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,160
revise." And that's kind of that

483
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,800
synthesis thing, right? that that you

484
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,160
know having a wild idea and and um you

485
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,079
know getting back to this idea of the

486
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,519
interruption. Nothing will stop a person

487
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,880
from wanting to contribute if um more

488
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,160
than than not being able to even have

489
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
their voice be heard, right? Like

490
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
they're trying to say something and then

491
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,240
they just get cut out by somebody else

492
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
who's like, "No, but this is better." Um

493
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,760
you know, especially for a shy person or

494
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,000
a person who's otherwise feeling like my

495
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,120
ideas are worthless. Um they they won't

496
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,919
be able to get it out because they've

497
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,600
then been they've then been cut short.

498
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,959
Um so this you know some of this

499
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,480
responsibility falls on what we might

500
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,120
call the leader which I'll talk about

501
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
later of of the of the group. Um but

502
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,000
really it it's kind of a collective

503
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,840
responsibility that everybody kind of um

504
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
make sure that as someone is expressing

505
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,799
an idea that it's maintained. Adding to

506
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,039
that you know

507
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,400
keep the keep the description of your

508
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,520
idea short. Um you know if people are

509
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,120
sitting here and it's like you've now

510
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
hijacked the 30 minute brainstorming

511
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,640
session with your one idea that took

512
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,320
five minutes to explain. um that that

513
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,679
can also hamper it, right? Part of it is

514
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
not only don't interrupt people, but

515
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,440
also make sure that when you are

516
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
contributing, you are allowing for other

517
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,320
people to contribute as well. Um

518
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,120
something that maybe is not considered

519
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,559
as much. Um for the organization,

520
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,080
designate a leader. I hate that term,

521
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,840
but that's what he used in the book. Um

522
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,440
I I tend to use the term clerk, which is

523
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
kind of a quaker idea, which I I kind of

524
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
grab on to. A clerk, you know, being

525
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,880
more of a facilitator than an actual

526
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,840
leader. Um you know, leader suggests,

527
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,640
you know, boss. It's always not great

528
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,240
for a for a, you know, everyone's even

529
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
sort of brainstorming session. Um, and

530
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
then of course the secretary or as he

531
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,760
calls it an associate theater. Um, you

532
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,840
know, this is someone who who writes

533
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,440
stuff down. You know, there's some of

534
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,160
that that good old fashioned hierarchy

535
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
going on in this in this text, but um

536
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,880
but you know, obviously we'll talk a

537
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,720
little bit more about what the roles of

538
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,640
these people are, but but having those

539
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
those roles uh defined early is

540
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,640
important. Um,

541
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,160
and then this is this is something to

542
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
talk about a bit explaining the process

543
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,120
and the principal question at the start

544
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,200
of the session. Um, you know, I don't

545
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,039
know how how many of you had heard of

546
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
these four principles of brainstorming

547
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,480
explicitly prior to reading this text?

548
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,919
Anybody? Oh, well,

549
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,160
I know you heard from me. But, um, but

550
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,080
yeah, the um, you know, the process is

551
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440
something that it needs to be clear

552
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,880
otherwise people won't remember to do.

553
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
And you'll see when we do the exercise,

554
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,559
it's it's even hard sometimes to curb

555
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,600
your criticism. You know, it's it's just

556
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
when especially when you're comfortable

557
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,400
with people and you may not mean it in a

558
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,320
malicious way. You may not mean it in a

559
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,440
way to kind of uh you know stop the

560
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
brainstorming session, but you just be

561
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,160
like, "Oh, that's nuts." You know, we're

562
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,360
laughing and everybody's having a good

563
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,120
time. And then you kind of like think

564
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
back and like wait, you know, that was

565
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,039
me passing judgment on an idea and

566
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,240
possibly inhibiting the kind of the kind

567
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,799
of ideation that we're trying to get

568
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,480
across. So, um explaining the process at

569
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,760
the beginning regardless of the group is

570
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,120
really important and that is usually

571
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,880
responsibility that falls on the leader

572
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,880
or the secretary, whoever is organizing

573
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
the session, right? They even suggest in

574
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
the text have it posted have the four

575
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
principles up so that everybody can kind

576
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,679
of remind themselves through the process

577
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,799
what these four principles are. Um but

578
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,360
explaining the process is really

579
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,919
important and this this is I can't even

580
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,840
this is so important. Um having the

581
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,240
principal question and the goal of the

582
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,679
brainstorming session clear at the start

583
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,960
um you know obviously it's it's this is

584
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,160
encouraging freewheeling. It's

585
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,760
encouraging free thought. that's

586
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,440
encouraging this all kind of you know

587
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,600
wide openen creativity and yet at the

588
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
same time if you do that in an unbounded

589
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,400
sort of way you might end up with things

590
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
that that really in the end you don't

591
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,840
have too many useful ideas you've got

592
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,120
useful ideas for something else not for

593
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,480
the actual creative problem that you

594
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,960
have. So, I mean, you take it from an ad

595
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,200
ad concept, you know, so you've got a

596
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,960
vodka company that's like, "Oh, we need

597
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,320
we need an advertisement for our, you

598
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
know, awesome vodka or whatever." And

599
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
so, you're like, "All right, well, we

600
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,760
have a brainstorm session." Then a bunch

601
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,640
of people come up with ideas. Now,

602
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,000
you're selling dryers. Um, because it

603
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,919
was wide open, right? And it's like,

604
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,360
"Oh, we've got these great ad ideas for

605
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,799
dryers, but they're just really, really

606
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,200
not going to work." You know, bringing

607
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,039
it back to a video game contest. um you

608
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,480
know, you've got a contract with a

609
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,679
producer to make a first-person shooter,

610
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,760
and in your brainstorming session,

611
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,320
you've designed um a cool cute

612
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,679
platformer. Um neat, but that's not

613
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
where the money's coming from, right?

614
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,679
So, so bounding the brainstorm session

615
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,280
is important, too. And and you'll kind

616
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,440
of see that in the exercises that we do

617
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,000
today, how it's important to to bound

618
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,000
that. Um

619
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,799
yes.

620
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,240
Oh, and write down everything. Yeah,

621
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,159
sorry, I forgot about that. This is an

622
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,520
important uh important question. Uh

623
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,880
important point um you know you this

624
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,919
happens to all of us but you have this

625
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
great idea and then you don't write it

626
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,720
down and then you you go to bed and then

627
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,720
the next day you're like oh I had this

628
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,799
great idea great idea and you can't

629
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,080
remember it right and so um writing down

630
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,320
everything is absolutely essential.

631
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,240
You'll never you know you'd be amazed

632
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,840
the number of times that you know a week

633
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,559
later you're like oh we could put these

634
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,559
two ideas together um as long as you can

635
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,559
remember what those ideas were. Um, and

636
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,159
so what you think, you know, it's hard

637
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,440
to not mentally pass judgment on things

638
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
during the brainstorm session. And what

639
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
you think might be great now may a week

640
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,360
later not be as great and what you

641
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,960
didn't think, you know, will be. And so

642
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,480
making sure to have everything written

643
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,559
down is really important. And and they

644
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,720
even suggest, you know, having um two

645
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,880
secretaries if you need if you've got a

646
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,360
large group or lots of ideas and they're

647
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,480
each writing every other one um can be

648
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,919
helpful to make sure that you get

649
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,000
everything right so that you get

650
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,840
everything. So um

651
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,679
next is the question of what sort of

652
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,280
problems are suitable to a brainstorming

653
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,520
session. Uh the great example that Alex

654
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,039
Osborne gives is um setting up a

655
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,840
brainstorm session on whether or not to

656
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,760
get married um is not a particularly

657
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,760
suitable question. I that was sort of an

658
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,919
interesting uh interesting concept. He's

659
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,880
like well to decide to get married you

660
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,480
you apparently list the pros and cons.

661
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
That's not exactly the process I went

662
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,799
through before I got married. I was like

663
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,440
well honey I'm going to have to write

664
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,120
this down. Um

665
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,320
but fair enough that that wasn't the

666
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
suggestion that he came up with. And he

667
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,120
has a good point, right? I mean it's the

668
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,360
question of whether or not to get

669
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,000
married is a judgment call. Um it is not

670
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,880
a creative uh ideation process. And so

671
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,960
that's not a particularly useful um kind

672
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,840
of uh problem that's suitable to the

673
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,840
brainstorming process. Um you know, you

674
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,240
want you want a uh you want a problem

675
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,880
that is going to be benefited by having

676
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,880
a large uh a large selection, a large

677
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,240
corpus of ideas. And so those are the

678
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,159
kind of problems that are more more

679
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,919
useful. And you know, you'll see when we

680
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,240
do our example exercise what some of

681
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,120
those might be. Um I also kind of put

682
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,559
here that um you know having a clear

683
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,600
definition of the aim is really

684
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,039
essential. It's sort of what we talked

685
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
about before. Um you need to make sure

686
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,600
that everybody understands and

687
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,679
everybody's on the same page. Otherwise

688
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,120
you end up with stuff that um that might

689
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,480
be useful for something else but not

690
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,480
useful for what you're you're

691
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,919
particularly trying to do. Um and so

692
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,240
making that clear for everybody is

693
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,480
really important. Um, keeping the

694
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,000
problem as simple as possible, um, you

695
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,919
know, is also really important. Trying

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,240
to keep simple language, uh, for the

697
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,720
problem. Uh, keep it, you know, keep it

698
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,400
constrained in a way that that, um, is

699
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,880
simple enough so that people can kind of

700
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,360
work on it as opposed to just feeling

701
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
limited by it. Um, if that makes any

702
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,600
sense. You know, something is overly

703
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,039
complicated and overly constrained. Um,

704
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,039
then it becomes a well, how do I fit

705
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,799
everything into this? You know, how do I

706
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,480
match every single one of these things?

707
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,559
If it's simpler, then it's a little bit

708
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,919
easier to kind of work on and kind of be

709
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,840
creative. So, keeping problems simple.

710
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,960
Um, which isn't to say that complex

711
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,039
problems couldn't be dealt with, but

712
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,960
just divide this divide them into sub

713
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,240
problems, right? Divide them into little

714
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,520
little sections. So, there might be

715
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
something like, you know, how could we

716
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,640
deal with the UI? Um, you know, how

717
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,080
could it look in this uh in this game,

718
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
you know? So, rather than say, well, how

719
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,960
are we going to design our first person

720
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,320
shooter? You've got a brainstorming

721
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
session about what the UI could look

722
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,039
like for the first person shooter.

723
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,120
you've got maybe a brainstorming session

724
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,559
for um you know what the fiction for

725
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
this first person shooter might be.

726
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,400
You're dividing it into sub problems

727
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,640
rather than having it be this gigantic

728
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,760
you know model of of a thing. And you

729
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
can see how that would be a problem,

730
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,400
right? Because if you just brainstorm on

731
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,000
what's our first person shooter going to

732
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,360
be, you're going to get ideas about the

733
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
UI. You're going to get ideas about the

734
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,880
fiction. You're going to get ideas about

735
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,240
what sort of guns you should use or what

736
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,720
they should sound like. And it'll just

737
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,919
be lots of interesting ideas but we get

738
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,400
all over the place.

739
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,400
uh and yeah uh problems should be

740
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,760
clearly and simply articulated. I think

741
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,039
that's what I sort of said by should be

742
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,320
simple just you know make sure that

743
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,520
they're articulated in the simple way.

744
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,440
Sometimes you can have a simple problem

745
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:11,120
that's not articulated particularly

746
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:14,240
clearly. Um so it's just something um

747
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,679
responsibilities of the leader clerk

748
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,840
whatever um

749
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,120
the first being uh to understand and

750
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,559
explain the problem and the aim of the

751
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,880
brainstorm session. I mean a lot of

752
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,720
times people uh maybe will write a memo

753
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,480
beforehand um you know as the

754
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,960
facilitator of the of the thing as the

755
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,520
person who perhaps wants to see the

756
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,919
brainstorm be a success uh the most

757
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,960
maybe um you know having a clear

758
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,320
understanding of the problem and

759
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,320
explaining that to the group is an

760
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,240
important job for the leader um I use

761
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,760
this term facilitating the session uh

762
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,679
encouraging ideiation discouraging

763
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,840
criticism you're kind of the watch guard

764
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,799
for the process not necessarily um you

765
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,640
can sometimes be a contributor and a

766
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,720
watchdog for the process. But most

767
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,919
importantly is that you are a watchdog

768
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,840
for the process. Um it's you'll you'll

769
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,440
see as we do it, it's just so easy to

770
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,520
kind of slip into these conversational

771
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,000
habits that are contrary to

772
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,080
brainstorming uh brainstorming process

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,600
and uh and so having someone who's

774
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,200
constantly like making sure don't

775
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,159
criticize encouraging people like oh I

776
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
haven't heard from this person. Do you

777
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,279
have any ideas? You know, even kind of

778
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,559
pulling people out is important. Um and

779
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,919
that comes to that ensuring that no

780
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,360
voices are lost during the discussion,

781
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,200
right? I mean we had that abbleist

782
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,559
member who had 15 ideas that he wrote

783
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
down and he's like they're worthless.

784
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,159
Well, in some ways it's the part of the

785
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,000
leader either during the session or

786
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,520
after the session to try to encourage,

787
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,039
you know, those able members to

788
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,720
contribute. Um yeah, I mean it's some of

789
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,240
the most crackpot ideas become the best

790
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,080
ones. So you really want to make sure

791
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,760
every voice is heard. Um and then

792
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,000
encouraging the synthesis, encouraging

793
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,480
people to kind of riff on other ideas.

794
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Um you know, trying to find ways for

795
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,960
people to build on each other even

796
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,320
offering synthesis towards a direction.

797
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,080
So maybe you have a couple ideas you're

798
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,679
like, "Oh, like you know, one and 10 are

799
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,120
kind of similar, but like you know, are

800
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,640
there any ways we can combine this?" And

801
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,080
like, "Yeah, we could, you know, give

802
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,919
him a helmet." Awesome.

803
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,600
So on so forth. I don't know what what

804
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,640
two things can combine to get a helmet,

805
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,360
but can't get shot in the head. How

806
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,520
about a helmet? All right. Um, so

807
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,360
responsibilities for the secretary. most

808
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,279
obviously record every and all ideas.

809
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,840
It's like write it all down. You have to

810
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,720
write it all down. This is so important.

811
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,320
Um this one is often overlooked. Uh

812
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,440
monitoring the schedule and the duration

813
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,440
of the session. Um something I learned a

814
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,120
long long long time ago is one of the

815
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,120
worst things that can happen is meetings

816
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,240
that run over or meetings that start

817
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,559
late or meetings um you know that don't

818
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,320
adhere to a schedule. no no better way

819
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,960
to kind of uh you know lose your

820
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,240
employees or lose your staff um than to

821
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,760
to kind of bite into their time. Um and

822
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,440
so you know making sure that it's

823
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,039
constrained and that it meets the

824
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,799
duration is really important. And so you

825
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,960
know may seem simple but timing the

826
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,159
thing. Um and then of course if

827
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,520
applicable participating in the

828
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
brainstorming you know like I said all

829
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,799
voices um all voices should be heard and

830
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,120
that you know oftentimes would mean that

831
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,159
the secretary is a uh is a creative

832
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,440
professional as well. Um And so make

833
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,279
sure that you participate quickly.

834
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,320
So

835
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,799
we've got a few exercises now to get you

836
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,440
acclimated to the idea of brainstorming.

837
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,360
Um the first one is an actual individual

838
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,399
brainstorm. So uh if you have paper,

839
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,240
grab some paper.

840
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,360
If anyone's lacking either writing

841
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,279
equipment or paper,

842
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,600
>> you could use a note card, too. It's

843
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,919
really just something to write on other

844
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,919
than the table.

845
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,640
Not cards are totally fine.

846
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,159
>> Um, I'll, as you guys are getting ready,

847
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,520
I'll continue to talk. This is actually

848
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,039
something that I didn't mention in the

849
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,880
process, but what is actually very

850
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,120
useful to the brainstorming process. I

851
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,120
think doing warm-ups before your actual

852
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,320
brainstorm is useful. Um, you know,

853
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,320
people show up just for lunch,

854
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,799
especially because one of those eating.

855
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Um, you know, people, you know,

856
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,679
sometimes they're tired. People just

857
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,840
might have other things on the brain.

858
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,200
So, getting getting in the habit,

859
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,240
getting warmed up to uh being creative,

860
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,880
um, is important. I I tend to find it's

861
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,720
a rare it's a rare kind of person who

862
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,240
you just sort of give a blank piece of

863
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,480
paper to and you're like, "Ah, make

864
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
something. Go be creative." And they're

865
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
like, they just like whip something out,

866
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,520
right? You got you got to kind of get

867
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,200
warmed up. Um, you know, visual artists

868
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,240
sketch constantly and that that makes

869
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,720
sense and I make film sketches. Um, I I

870
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,399
just make dumb pieces of music that I'll

871
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
maybe never use for anything, but maybe

872
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,120
I will. Um, who knows? I make stupid

873
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,240
sound effects in the shower. Um, I

874
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,159
consider that warming up for work. Um,

875
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,679
so, uh, you know, you have to kind of

876
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,279
get warmed up. And so, this is just a

877
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,000
really quick five minute, uh, five

878
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,360
minute warm up. And the idea is, um,

879
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,039
write anything that comes to your mind

880
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,360
for this specific problem. And I'll show

881
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,480
you a picture. brainstorm possible uses.

882
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,320
It's not really brainstorm. It's more of

883
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,520
just like a you individually come up

884
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,919
with creative ideas uh creative uses uh

885
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,760
for the following item and I'll give you

886
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,760
five minutes starting now.

887
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,880
All right.

888
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,000
Hopefully was good for a warm up. Quick

889
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,000
question and show

890
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,039
and be honest.

891
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,039
This is a safe mind.

892
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,640
How many of you had an idea that you did

893
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,520
not write down? How many of you self

894
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,960
censored yourself with an idea?

895
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,360
Yeah. You're like, "Oh, that's just

896
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,720
dumb." See, it's really it's hard to get

897
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,480
out of the habit of doing that. It's

898
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,720
hard to get out of this kind of this

899
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,520
habit of self- judgment. Um, and it's

900
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,360
really important. Um, you know, that

901
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,039
that dumb idea that you think was

902
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,480
worthless might be a good one. Does

903
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,279
anyone who raised their hand want to

904
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:04,000
share what their censored idea was? just

905
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:06,799
to exercise the demons, so to speak.

906
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,080
>> No, nothing.

907
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,279
>> All right. Who wants to share some ideas

908
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,000
that they did write down? All right.

909
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,360
Here we go.

910
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960

interesting flat shape and then put it

957
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,279

it by bending it and then bending it and

968
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,559
then it gets hot.

969
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,919

>> You say that again.

975
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,960
>> Let's say like there's a robot made by

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,280
to remind it become like a secret thing.

978
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,599
>> Yeah. My favorite use for a paperclip is

979
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,599
cleaning the lint out of my uh iPhone

980
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,679
ear jack, which drives me absolutely

981
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,440
nuts. So, I'm running on reserve battery

982
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,079
power and my slideshow has been

983
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,879
suspended on in my office. There's a uh

984
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,280
there's a air.

985
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,800
So, um

986
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,320
so yeah, how did we feel about that

987
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,839
exercise? Got you loosened up a little

988
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,399
bit. Got you thinking about some ideas.

989
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,079
Got you feeling a little creative juices

990
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,800
fine. We've got three more exercises

991
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,200
that we're going to do. Um,

992
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,800
so much brainstorming.

993
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,960
This is the hardest work I've ever done

994
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,399
to get my chicken. No. Um, yeah. So,

995
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,839
we've got a few more exercise to get you

996
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,599
guys kind of comfortable, get you guys,

997
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,040
you know, relaxed with this kind of

998
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,119
brainstorming process. The next one is

999
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,800
going to be a group exercise. Um, I'm

1000
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,119
going to wait to describe it until I can

1001
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,400
get uh get my slideshow. Anybody else

1002
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,880
have any particularly choice paperclip

1003
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,520
ideas? Start one.

1007
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,480
>> All right.

1008
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,000
>> Hold up. Stop looking at

1009
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,839
it like as a spear.

1010
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,160

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:53,560
>> Launcher rubber band launcher

1016
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,880
You heard of the guy who had an

1017
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,770
oversized red tape equip and ended up

1018
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
trading it for a house

1019
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:19,720
[Applause]

1020
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,720
towards a house.

1021
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,240
>> Pretty cool. So, so hopefully that got

1022
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,760
you loosened up. I do want to just

1023
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,359
emphasize again for those of you who

1024
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,720
raised your hand and even those of you

1025
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,560
who did not raise your hand because you

1026
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,800
were censoring the truth because you're

1027
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,560
afraid try not to self censor. Um really

1028
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,440
it's important to brainstorming. I bet

1029
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,920
some

1030
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,920
>> Yeah, I know. Stop self-centering. I bet

1031
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,720
I bet those crappy ideas that you write

1032
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,320
down are actually really awesome. So um

1033
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,800
activity number two uh we're going to

1034
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,400
work as one large group. Um this is our

1035
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,640
con shell. Doesn't look like one, I

1036
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,720
know, but um you know the principle

1037
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,440
still applies. Um this is just to kind

1038
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,920
of get us in the habit in the shape of

1039
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,320
uh kind of speaking one at a time uh not

1040
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,000
interrupting each other. Um and in some

1041
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,680
senses building on each other's ideas

1042
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,440
too, right? There's something in the

1043
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,280
physical kind of passing of the ball

1044
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,359
after you've heard someone's idea that

1045
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,599
might encourage that sort of synthesis

1046
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,480
of ideas as you're going. Um I will be

1047
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,839
your fearless leader. Um all that means

1048
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,560
is I just kind of make sure you're not

1049
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,680
interrupting each other. Um uh and we're

1050
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,000
going to brainstorm solutions to uh a a

1051
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,320
design problem. Uh this one I think is

1052
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,480
actually a lot of fun. Um so I will show

1053
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,040
you the design problem. I will maybe

1054
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
throw out an idea and then I will toss

1055
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,240
the con shell to first person who wants

1056
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,240
it and then it doesn't have to come back

1057
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,079
to me. Just anyone who wants it throw up

1058
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,240
your hand and we'll kind of keep moving

1059
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,480
around. Please close the lids on your

1060
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,359
drinks.

1061
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,240
put put away put away your crystal stuff

1062
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,160
that you don't want to shatter. Um, so

1063
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,920
we will take approximately 15 minutes on

1064
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,000
this. We'll see how our momentum goes.

1065
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,320
Um, so you just finished updating Tetris

1066
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,599
for Xbox Live Arcade. Awesome. I don't

1067
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,000
know how you got the rights, but that's

1068
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,599
great. Um, Microsoft is demanding a set

1069
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,960
of achievements uh for integrating the

1070
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,400
game into their online service because

1071
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,880
unless you have achievements, it's not a

1072
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,359
real game. Um,

1073
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,280
so we are going to brainstorm possible

1074
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,480
player achievements uh for your new

1075
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,599
version of Tetris. You know what

1076
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,200
achievements are, right? Those little

1077
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,400
things that pop up on your Xbox every

1078
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,800
time you do anything. Um, so that is our

1079
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,119
idea for Tetris achievements. And I'll

1080
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,760
start. Uh, how about for actually

1081
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,400
getting four lines? You get a Tetris

1082
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,880
achievement must be next.

1083
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,480
>> Uh, you get an achievement for losing as

1084
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,960
quickly as possible, which I think would

1085
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:40,720
just be like Very good.

1086
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,880
>> Getting three lines with S piece.

1087
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,280
>> Uh drawing some sort of unique little

1088
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,079
picture with the Tetris blocks like uh

1089
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:52,280
you know something perhaps

1090
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,280
>> putting one of each block down.

1091
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,920
>> Uh lasting for a certain amount of time

1092
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,480
without them ever getting above a

1093
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,480
certain height.

1094
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,000
a certain amount of time without ever

1095
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,480
rotating a piece.

1096
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,560
>> Modern Tetris games have a system where

1097
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,000
you can rotate indefinitely when your

1098
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,680
piece is down. So, you rotate

1099
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,560
indefinitely for a minute or two or

1100
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,079
three minutes.

1101
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,760
>> Lasting a certain amount of time without

1102
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,760
ever clearing a line with a straight

1103
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,760
piece.

1104
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,920
Putting your piece down underneath

1105
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,880
another piece

1106
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,960
>> into a little hole.

1107
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,000
>> The teeth.

1108
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,000
>> There you go. Spelling USSR with your

1109
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
pieces.

1110
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,800
>> How's the bathroom?

1111
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,720
>> Um, making like a congeration of all the

1112
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,720
pieces into like the shape of a regular

1113
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,720
piece.

1114
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,119
>> Very cool.

1115
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,960
Uh, basically only moving the pieces in

1116
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,119
B to the music that's playing

1117
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,800
>> spelling your say with your pieces. I

1118
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,800
don't know if it's possible, but doing

1119
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,800
it.

1120
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,960
>> Uh, high score and high score without

1121
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,960
clearing lines.

1122
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,560
>> Uh, managing to clear the entire board

1123
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,680
in a game that has already reached the

1124
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,680
top line but not quite.

1125
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,400
putting a piece down without actually uh

1126
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,400
looking at the piece at all.

1127
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:37,800
>> Most pieces per time.

1128
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
>> Sure.

1129
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,640
>> One day of continuous tetris

1130
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,440
marathon

1131
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,359
>> breaking the previous high.

1132
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,800
Only ever shifting pieces either right

1133
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,720
or the left the entire game.

1134
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,320
>> Ah,

1135
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,839
>> doing the marathon challenge but only

1136
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,400
listening to one piece of music the

1137
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,280
entire time.

1138
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,839
>> The same

1139
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,040
>> clearing a level by dropping pieces

1140
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,119
before they fall five spaces.

1141
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,119
>> All right.

1142
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,720
>> Rotating every single piece that you

1143
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,359
play.

1144
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,440
>> Oh, very good.

1145
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,079
uh never going above a certain line for

1146
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,079
a certain amount of time.

1147
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,079
>> All of the above but on different equity

1148
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,079
levels

1149
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,760
>> uh clearing three lines with a T.

1150
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,560
>> Sure.

1151
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,119
>> Starting up the game,

1152
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,319
>> clearing a kind of screen

1153
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,680
>> using the L block.

1154
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,680
Doesn't matter how.

1155
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,319
different color. So, you know, lines

1156
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,319
always

1157
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,560
>> rotating a piece 720°

1158
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,760
>> only matching pieces such that the new

1159
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,720
blocks that fall down are touching

1160
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,920
blocks of the same color.

1161
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,839
>> Clear two four block segments with two

1162
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,440
consecutive uh lines.

1163
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,440
Uh, clearing a level using only

1164
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,440
tetrises.

1165
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,359
>> Sorry, you can't talk anymore.

1166
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,319
>> Challenging somebody on your friends

1167
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,520
list to beat the score.

1168
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:37,880
>> Um, fighting against someone on friends

1169
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,880
list to lose faster.

1170
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,760
>> Having no holes in the block for

1171
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,920
Yeah.

1172
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,760
Uh, inviting a friend on one of your

1173
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:55,040
Xbox Live friends to play with you.

1174
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,880
>> Five consecutive line clears.

1175
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,480
>> Beating one of your friends on Xbox Live

1176
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:05,000
when you play with them.

1177
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,000
>> Losing to a friend on Xbox Live.

1178
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,960
>> Playing with a friend for one hour

1179
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,960
continuously one day.

Beating a score set by the original

1181
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,560

>> Clearing a line somewhere above the

block filled in.

1185
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,760
>> I think it definitely is.

1186
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,480
>> Someone's going to have ideas. There's

1187
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,440
an idea.

1188
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,440

1189
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,720
>> losing 100 times.

1190
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,720
>> Yeah.

1191
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,760
>> Playing on increasingly ridiculous

1192
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,839
difficulties with achievements for each

1193
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,440
four speeds.

1194
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,359
using the speed

1195
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,440
>> completing a Tetris challenge, which is

1196
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,960
presumably some kind of thing where you

1197
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,240
have to drop blocks in the right

1198
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,680
sequence in order to clear all the

1199
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,440
lines. Yeah.

1200
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:21,920
>> Clearing a thousand lines.

1201
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,839
>> Uh playing invisible mode.

1202
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,359
>> Uh playing for a certain amount of time

1203
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,359
while holding down the down key

1204
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,359
continuously.

>> I don't know if you only rotating in one

1206
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,119
direction always. I don't know if

1207
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,240
someone said that or not.

1208
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,240
>> Getting 10 achievements in Tetris.

1209
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,079
>> Getting every achievement in

1210
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
>> the Tetris.

1211
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,520
>> Oh no. How can you get it?

1212
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,760
>> It's a paradox. It's impossible.

1213
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,319
>> Always having blocks on the far left and

1214
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,640
on the far right column.

1215
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,480
Cool.

1216
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,000
I think that that had some that had some

1217
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,280
decent momentum, but you know, I think

1218
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,640
like our mission was accomplished,

1219
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,760
right? Like we were really only giving

1220
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,359
one idea at a time because it was only

1221
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,359
the person who had the ball was talking.

1222
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,800
Um that, you know, probably with a

1223
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,000
little bit more speed and momentum, but

1224
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,359
it was nice. Like we did had a little

1225
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,240
building on ideas. You know, we're

1226
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,480
starting to get this kind of brainstorm.

1227
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,839
There was still some shyness, which is,

1228
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,880
you know, people have different

1229
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,760
personalities, but stop being shy.

1230
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,560
You're allowed to have your different

1231
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,400
personalities, but stop it. No. Um, so

1232
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,839
that's activity number two. Um,

1233
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,280
any questions about that process? How do

1234
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,560
you feel about it? Any thoughts on it

1235
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,119
before we go on to the next activity?

1236
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,040
>> All right, next activity. Actually, this

1237
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,400
might be this is our last activity.

1238
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,400
Sorry, I said, but there's only three.

1239
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,400
>> Um, okay. So, this one is a more formal

1240
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,760
uh a more formal uh brainstorm. And

1241
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,280
actually, I screwed up that last one. We

1242
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,440
didn't have a secretary. So all of those

1243
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,599
great Tetris ideas are now lost. I can't

1244
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,140
remember any.

1245
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,800
>> Oh yes.

1246
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,920
[Applause]

1247
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,599
>> Do we not have that 1950s or something?

1248
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,000
>> Let me just get these waxers.

1249
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,680
So uh what we're going to do is we're

1250
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,079
going to separate the two design teams.

1251
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,680
Um so it'll just totally be by by

1252
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,880
location. We'll just kind of get half of

1253
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,760
you over here and half of you over

1254
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,079
there. Um, I want the team to designate

1255
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,920
one leader. That's gonna be the person

1256
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,520
who's responsible. Clerk for

1257
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,880
facilitating it. Oh, did I say clerk

1258
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,800
there? A leader and a secretary. It's

1259
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,839
supposed to be a clerk, leader, and a

1260
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,280
secretary. Um, so one person to write

1261
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,440
everything down, one person to obviously

1262
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,680
facilitate and and we're going to do a

1263
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,000
we're going to do a kind of a 20 or so

1264
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,800
minute uh brainstorm uh for a game

1265
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,960
pitch. Um, what do I mean by game pitch?

1266
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,599
It's kind of think of the uh think of

1267
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,119
the you're in an elevator with Miiamoto

1268
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,760
or you're in an elevator with you know

1269
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,680
Philip Han and uh you have this game

1270
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,400
idea that you need to pitch but you're

1271
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,160
only going to the 10th floor or so and

1272
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,599
so really you've got like 30 seconds a

1273
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,440
minute 2 minutes maybe um to kind of get

1274
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,520
the core information about this game

1275
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,800
app. Um so that can be something like a

1276
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,319
title maybe a tagline for it um any main

1277
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,800
features uh you might have for it. Um,

1278
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,200
of course it would be way too easy or

1279
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,800
way actually crazy for me to be like any

1280
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,160
game at all because there's lots of

1281
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,520
different types of games obviously. So

1282
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,880
it's going to be a game based on the

1283
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,079
following constraint. So what I'd like

1284
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,599
to do first before I give you the

1285
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,680
constraint is let's divide ourselves in

1286
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,280
half. We can kind of draw this like

1287
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,119
imaginary line diagonally dividing the

1288
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,880
two of you back there and and we'll just

1289
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,880
get we just get one half here.

1290
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,720
And once I give you the constraint,

1291
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,760
we'll actually find a separate room for

1292
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,760
for the other team for one of the teams.

1293
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,200
>> You're stuck on the little wire.

1294
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,040
>> That's an achievement right there.

1295
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,599
>> I always think that when I'm watching my

1296
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,240
like

1297
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,720
think like something happens,

1298
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,720
>> especially when someone

1299
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,599
you watch this movie.

1300
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,680
If someone has a piece of paper, they

1301
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,960
can down there, right?

1302
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,720
>> Yeah, just write out a piece of paper.

1303
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,079
So, um, so these are your teams. You

1304
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,000
guys will go into that room. You guys

1305
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,000
stay out here. Um, as soon as I give you

1306
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,040
the constraint, designate a designate a

1307
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,240
clerk/ leader, um, leader and a

1308
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,480
secretary, someone to write everything

1309
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,319
down because our groups are relatively

1310
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,040
small, right? We can have the leader and

1311
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,800
the uh the secretary involved in the

1312
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,040
brainstorming process. Please don't be

1313
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,880
afraid of contributing. But if you are

1314
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,480
designated as this leader, keep in mind

1315
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,119
your primary responsibility is

1316
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,319
facilitating the brainstorm. You want to

1317
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,160
make sure it runs smoothly. You want to

1318
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,680
make sure people are not criticizing

1319
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,920
ideas. You want to make sure that it's

1320
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,319
going okay. Any questions on this before

1321
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,480
I give you your constraints?

1322
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,000
Everything make sense? All good. Okay.

1323
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,640
Here are the constraints for the game.

1324
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,079
Uh it must have zombies. It must have a

1325
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,160
love. It must be massively multiplayer.

1326
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,280
Um so that those are the constraints for

1327
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,000
your game. that's what the publisher is

1328
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,079
going to give you money for. Um uh so

1329
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,920
you need to develop a pitch a pitch for

1330
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:20,800
this game idea. Um a title tagline what

1331
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,240
what have you. All right. So you guys

1332
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,040
we'll we'll take you in this room over

1333
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,960
here. You guys stay here. Designate a

1334
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,119
leader and a secretary and then start

1335
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,559
brainstorming.

1336
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,160
Secretary

1337
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,280
>> Oh, I love this. It's like I don't want

1338
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,599
to be the leader. I don't want to be the

1339
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,000
secretary.

1340
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,760
>> I said I'll do it. Oh

1341
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,800
secretary. Wait, he wanted to be the

1342
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,480
secretary.

1343
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,760
>> Oh, you're secretary.

1344
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,520
>> One of your secretary wants to use

1345
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,720
leader. So you get a leader then.

1346
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,359
>> Because you're interested in those game

1347
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,480
and you lost.

1348
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:52,000
>> Brings up the age question.

1349
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,800
>> If they're both vampires or they're both

1350
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,800
zombies, does it count as necessities

1351
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,960
manages to have

1352
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,520
>> encompass all of those except the

1353
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,240
massively multiplayer parties licensed

1354
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,760
title right there. Make it Nazi zombies.

1355
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,000
Two Nazi zombie. No, a forbidden love. A

1356
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,880
Nazi zombies in love with like an allied

1357
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
zombie

1358
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,559
>> and Jewish.

1359
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,960
>> Yes.

1360
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,800
>> And then it's So there's two factions.

1361
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,200
It could be Well, they're all people

1362
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,119
like online. One group there's like two

1363
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,640
factions. There's the ally group and the

1364
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,720
axis group.

1365
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,240
>> What if What if they're all Nazis?

1366
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,240
>> What What What if there's two factions?

1367
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,839
There's the zombies and the humans and

1368
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,319
they're drawn into war because there's a

1369
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,240
love there's a love story between a a

1370
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,000
zombie and a human and the leaders get

1371
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,520
pissed over this and so we're in war

1372
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,160
because of of like Rome and Julietesque

1373
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,280
zombie humans.

1374
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,480
>> What you're saying is we're having

1375
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,160
intelligent zombies.

1376
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,040
>> Yeah, intelligent zombies.

1377
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,040
>> Well, clearly they're semi-intm

1378
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
Hitler into this though just because

1379
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,160
it's Nazis. There must be a zombie

1380
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,280
Hitler. Who said this?

1381
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,920
>> Wait, what is your name?

1382
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,599
>> Bobby.

1383
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,040
>> What is your name?

1384
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,599
>> What is your name? Jason.

1385
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,680
>> Brian. On Jason's idea of is it

1386
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,520
necrophilia? I I think because there's a

1387
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,920
love story, the title could be necroilia

1388
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,480
question mark.

1389
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,880
>> Is it?

1390
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,920
>> Is it nec?

1391
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,920
>> Is it necroilia?

1392
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,720
>> Probably. Probably.

1393
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,359
>> Is it I like it as a love story, but is

1394
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,359
it a sex story?

1395
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,680
>> So, wait. How about this?

1396
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,079
>> Or maybe even zombie strippers that fall

1397
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,520
in love with.

1398
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,240
>> Have you seen Zombie Strippers?

1399
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,760
>> No.

1400
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,079
>> It's a terrible, wonderful, terrible

1401
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,880
movie.

1402
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,920
>> I'll watch it.

1403
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,920
>> You should not. Should

1404
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:48,400
>> um So the actually how about we have the

1405
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,400
zombies as the good guys? That way like

1406
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,319
the allies are trying to like make a

1407
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,480
weapon that will destroy like half the

1408
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,079
world and the zombies are like, "No,

1409
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,480
that will be bad. Let's make everyone

1410
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,880
else obvious so they agree with us."

1411
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,319
Well,

1412
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,520
>> what if what if

1413
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,040
>> what if you're just a zombie and

1414
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,160
everyone is trying to kill you, so you

1415
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,680
want to make everyone zombies so the

1416
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,880
world will be peaceful and happy.

1417
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,200
>> You want everyone to love you.

1418
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,319
>> Yeah,

1419
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,079
>> I like that a lot.

1420
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,079
>> And that's then

1421
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,520
even better. Love zombies. Like, who

1422
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:19,359
says they have to be undead? They can be

1423
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:23,359
infected by emotion.

1424
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:26,400
>> That's a tagline right there.

1425
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,880
>> Nudest zombies. What if what if like 95%

1426
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,760
of the world is zombie and so then the

1427
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,520
weird creatures that are like scary are

1428
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,280
the humans and they're like sentient

1429
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,640
they do weird things but the zombies all

1430
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,520
are happy and love each other.

1431
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,040
>> Maybe the humans have the love disease.

1432
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,640
>> They're trying to zombies

1433
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,640
like they're infecting zombies with

1434
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,640
love.

1435
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,040
>> So then each person would be I either

1436
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,160
start as a zombie or a human. They have

1437
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,599
to complete a bunch of little tasks

1438
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,880
before they can come, you know, and they

1439
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,400
like play challenges against each other.

1440
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,440
So be like zombie against zombie and one

1441
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,599
of them is infected, one of them isn't.

1442
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,200
>> So humans can infect zombies with blood

1443
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,160
that makes them not zombies.

1444
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,079
>> What if no zombies? What what if what if

1445
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,359
there's a dynamic what what if there's a

1446
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,960
dynamic between so there's there's two

1447
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,079
factions zombies and humans and every

1448
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,920
player is given a match and in this

1449
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,680
massive multiplayer world that one of

1450
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,760
their main objectives is to find their

1451
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,680
match who's in the opposing faction

1452
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,359
buried deep among hostile hordes of

1453
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,040
either humans or zombies find them and

1454
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,720
like live happily ever after together

1455
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,280
>> and become either zombies or humans

1456
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,760
together.

1457
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,480
>> Correct.

1458
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,160
>> But love zombies

1459
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,440
>> find a cure or just get bitten

1460
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,160
>> and become love zombies.

1461
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,400
>> Love zombies.

1462
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,400
>> Love zombies.

1463
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,800
Ask the question. Is there truly a

1464
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,680
difference between being in love and

1465
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,200
being undead?

1466
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,680
>> That's a great tagline.

1467
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,680
>> Maybe some task.

1468
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,880
>> What's even more blind? Having your eyes

1469
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,720
guided out by a zombie or being in love?

1470
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,160
>> So, so then we can draw it into not the

1471
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,680
actual Nazi zombie game.

1472
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,599
>> Maybe the Nazi zombies from the other

1473
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,520
point of view. So, they're just trying

1474
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,599
to have love and and the humans are

1475
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,400
trying to kill them.

1476
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,119
Um,

1477
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,240
>> wait. Are we having Nazis?

1478
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,760
>> We can.

1479
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,200
>> Some of the ideas can include Nazis and

1480
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,319
some of them can't and we can decide.

1481
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,599
>> Should we be getting to the point of

1482
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,880
judgment towards the end of the thing so

1483
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,559
we can finalize a pitch in a thing or

1484
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,880
whatever? Just just come up

1485
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,839
>> with just brainstorming. That's awesome.

1486
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,839
>> Yeah, it's just fun.

1487
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:25,200
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1488
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:27,040
>> How about um the player is a human

1489
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,240
fighting against the zombies and you

1490
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,680
have some kind of companion may or may

1491
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,839
not be a cube but that accompanies you

1492
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,880
on your journey to defeat the zombies.

1493
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,839
>> So companion cube I like better.

1494
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,599
>> Do plants love each other?

1495
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,359
>> That way that is a heart like that's

1496
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,240
like a love story between you and your

1497
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,760
cube.

1498
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,880
>> But can the can the cube become a

1499
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,920
zombie?

1500
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,280
>> Yes.

1501
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,359
>> I mean it could be a person like Left

1502
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,160
for Dead. like four people against all

1503
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,160
the zombies that they're always

1504
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,599
>> or witches. Maybe you're trying to get

1505
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,599
>> the love story is you and the witch

1506
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,440
consuming the thing and like

1507
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:09,119
>> what if so all players play zombies and

1508
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,480
most missions are stuff like you have to

1509
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,920
infect a city and just run around like

1510
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,880
binding people into the entire city that

1511
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,720
you've like conquered or turned into

1512
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,079
zombified. Your ultimate goal is that

1513
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,200
your girlfriend from back when you were

1514
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,200
human or your boyfriend from back when

1515
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,040
you were human is at some place and you

1516
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,400
want to infect all cities until you can

1517
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,319
get there and then infect her so that

1518
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,559
you guys can live happily ever after.

1519
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,559
>> A you could also

1520
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,400
>> also building on the idea of being

1521
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,040
zombies trying to infect cities.

1522
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,359
>> Oh god,

1523
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,960
>> you are zombies uh with Cupid's love

1524
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,880
arrows

1525
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,280
>> trying to infect the entire city with

1526
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,359
love at which point no no productivity

1527
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,960
is all gone in the city. zombie with

1528
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,480
love arrows infecting people.

1529
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,520
>> It could be set in the 1950s where

1530
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,200
everyone's like trying to be productive

1531
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,119
and not love each other.

1532
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,400
>> No, what if what if you build along the

1533
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,839
lines of, you know, having to infect the

1534
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,200
city, but you have to do that. One

1535
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,119
zombie can't infect an entire city,

1536
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,240
right? So, you have to like ally with

1537
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,359
other zombies, but they're like

1538
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,599
different factions of zombies. Kind of

1539
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:01,119
like two zombie mob families, right,

1540
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,480
that are trying to infect. They have two

1541
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,720
different, you know, varieties of this

1542
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,079
lovely in

1543
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,799
>> Oh, wait. Could there be like a drug

1544
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,240
trade? So like the like they have to

1545
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,480
infect people with like a certain drug.

1546
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,480
So it's like a drug war as well. And

1547
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,799
this the three swords good swords are

1548
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,000
cool.

1549
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,160
>> Zombie.

1550
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,599
>> What if

1551
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,599
>> what if when you have a zombie virus

1552
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,799
instead of wanting to eat people you are

1553
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,119
overcome with an urge to passionately

1554
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,880
make out with them. And if you make out

1555
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,880
with somebody then they turn into a love

1556
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,480
zombie too. And so there's no like

1557
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,079
decomposition going on so much as there

1558
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,280
is like hordes of people running through

1559
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,520
streets trying to passionately make out

1560
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,520
with each other. So wait

1561
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,359
>> being decaying and like decrepit. W

1562
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,000
zombies suddenly become very attractive.

1563
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,520
So you

1564
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,559
>> wait and they start like they start like

1565
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,880
taking care of their appearance and

1566
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,240
stuff.

1567
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,079
>> So when is limit is there I'm well after

1568
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,839
the zombies make out.

1569
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,640
>> What what's next?

1570
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:55,520
>> Well they get for

1571
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,920
Okay. So what if we just like make a

1572
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,920
like World of Warcraft type of MMO but

1573
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,400
every player player humans you have a

1574
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,400
zombie companion

1575
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,480
>> pet zombie?

1576
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,480
>> Yeah zombie

1577
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,480
peties

1578
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,240
>> no but they had

1579
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,799
>> the dead Pokemon. No, they had a pet as

1580
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,520
a pet.

1581
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,440
>> I think it's called

1582
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,839
>> Ph. It's like I think

1583
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,680
>> it's a movie called Phto.

1584
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,280
>> I've not seen it, but

1585
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,599
>> I've seen the trailer.

1586
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,680
>> So, what if you have to fight like with

1587
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,760
Pokemon zombies

1588
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,000
different powerups?

1589
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,680
>> Different kinds of zombies like uh like

1590
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,079
Left 4 Dead. There's, you know, the big

1591
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,920
fat ones that like vomit and you know,

1592
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,160
>> spitters. I hate spitters. But smokers.

1593
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,440
Smokers are the worst.

1594
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,839
>> Well, instead of pyro, you have blood

1595
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,880
potions. Man, he said smokers are the

1596
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,880
worst. That sounds like a dating s.

1597
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,680
I do I like the Pokemon idea. So, you

1598
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,119
can have um instead of like you're

1599
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,119
humans, but you just have to capture all

1600
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,400
the poke like different types of zombies

1601
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,359
and then you fight other people with

1602
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,720
their zombies and it's like match for

1603
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:09,359
zombie versus zombie.

1604
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,200
What if the love story is not for the

1605
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,520
player, but is in is in the story of the

1606
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,319
game in that the reason that you're

1607
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,680
waging war at the moment is because

1608
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,079
you're trying to steal a cure to

1609
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,599
zombieism because your fearless leader

1610
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,280
20 ranks up, you're president of

1611
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,200
whatever's girlfriend has been zombified

1612
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,720
or his wife has been zombified. And so

1613
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,359
the whole game, you're all the means in

1614
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,400
a quest to to try to find this cure, but

1615
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,319
you don't realize you're trying to find

1616
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,920
a cure for it's not for like your use or

1617
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,480
your girlfriend's use or whatever of

1618
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,079
people you love. It's for your leaders.

1619
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,119
>> And what if she is actually the leader

1620
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,440
of the zombies and

1621
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,440
>> Oh crap.

1622
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,760
>> What if the zombies are aliens?

1623
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,200
>> Zombie aliens.

1624
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,480
>> The blood. What if the zombies are

1625
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,799
ninjas?

1626
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,000
>> Yes.

1627
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,839
>> You can learn a lot.

1628
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,280
>> Combine the Pokemon of zombie ID with

1629
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,640
like the Sims where you like have a

1630
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,760
zombie that's under your control and

1631
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,200
you're trying to like teach your zombie

1632
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,880
to love and like maybe you're a

1633
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,960
different avatar. like a human avatar

1634
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,640
and you go through quests where you like

1635
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,359
take your zombie places and teach your

1636
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,280
zombie things

1637
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:08,000
>> and not to bite people and

1638
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,040
>> yeah exactly like I don't I don't know

1639
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,119
train your zombie

1640
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,440
>> maybe have so with the whole thing with

1641
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:16,240
the ninja pir ninja zombies might not

1642
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,000
have pirate pirates as well pirate

1643
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,119
zombies maybe

1644
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,839
>> pirate versus ninja

1645
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,079
>> zombies

1646
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,680
>> zombie edition special edition

1647
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,839
>> in space wrapped in bacon

1648
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,680
>> yes

1649
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:30,240
>> time traveling zombies

1650
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,640
I would be a great game to make just

1651
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,400
like pirate zombies versus ninja zombies

1652
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,200
in space wrapped in bacon and just make

1653
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:42,200
that game great.

1654
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,200
>> So is it necia probably

1655
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,760
>> pirate edition the ninja.

1656
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,680
>> So maybe you should divide into little

1657
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,680
sub brainstorms for like a name tagline

1658
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,680
all that. Do we as a name do we have

1659
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,599
anyone more brainstorming?

1660
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,160
I think we should figure out like a

1661
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,359
mechanic that works. So far, we have a

1662
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,920
lot of ideas about like what the game

1663
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,200
world is. We have no idea like how you

1664
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,799
play the game. So, maybe more

1665
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,200
brainstorming on that then.

1666
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:11,520
>> Yeah.

1667
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,319
>> It's massive multiplayer. ones working

1668
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,760
such as typical WoW style RPG, typical

1669
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,440
passive player FPS,

1670
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,920
Pokemon style RPG,

1671
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,000
>> Pokemon seem like Pokemon FPS

1672
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,880
>> or as we were saying before like The

1673
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,720
Sims Online.

1674
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,160
>> The Sims Online was so good.

1675
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,760
>> Did you play as a Pokemon?

1676
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,359
>> Yeah, maybe play as a Pokemon, but it's

1677
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,040
a first person shooter.

1678
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,960
>> But more like,

1679
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,960
>> but you still have like an RPG first

1680
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,960
person shooter as Pokemon. Wait

1681
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,960
a

1682
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,559
>> zombie.

1683
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,520
>> Wait, you have to you have to fight you

1684
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,040
have battles with uh words like uh

1685
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,559
Monkey Island.

1686
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,000
>> I like that text based zombie love.

1687
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,640
>> Text based zombie love.

1688
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,960
>> And then his really really long tongue

1689
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,640
down your throat.

1690
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,640
>> Zombie make out.

1691
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,240
>> Son of a title. So, if it's massively

1692
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,440
multiplayer, what if you, you know, you

1693
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,640
randomly get paired with five other

1694
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,839
players who are playing this game and

1695
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,040
you all have some kind of task you have

1696
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,480
to complete and you're given these

1697
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,640
particular zombie Pokemon that you can

1698
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,640
use to complete this particular task.

1699
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,160
>> So, you working those with those five.

1700
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,480
>> Wait, we have zombie pokeballs.

1701
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,440
>> What?

1702
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,000
>> We have a title.

1703
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,839
>> So, uh, Necroilia

1704
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,280
with F E L.

1705
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,280
>> The first zombie sex game.

1706
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,799
Oh no.

1707
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,079
>> What if wait if it's going to be popular

1708
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,200
in Japan? You have to have tentful

1709
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,440
somewhere.

1710
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,200
>> What if you are a zombie and all the

1711
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,040
players are zombies and the NPCs are the

1712
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,480
humans and you like try to go on quests

1713
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,400
to make yourself more attractive and

1714
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,319
like learn human customs and you get

1715
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,520
points for like seducing humans.

1716
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,040
>> Yes.

1717
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,240
>> You have to make sure your your brain

1718
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,640
speed meter doesn't get too low though.

1719
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,040
>> So you have to eat them in seduce them

1720
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,839
in. And then if you like eat them with

1721
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,599
certain you

1722
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,319
>> eat the ones you don't want.

1723
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,920
>> You Yeah,

1724
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,119
>> that actually sounds like a fun vampire

1725
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,880
game. I'm going to put that out there.

1726
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,880
You're a vampire. You have to seduce a

1727
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,720
human female to bring back to drink.

1728
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,000
>> It's like prototype or or you have to

1729
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,520
seduce a human because you want to

1730
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,200
seduce a human, but at the same time you

1731
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,400
have to eat humans. So you have to hide

1732
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,359
the fact you're eating humans for the

1733
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,480
human decision.

1734
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,079
>> Oh, I see. So you have a human

1735
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,559
girlfriend and then like you eat other

1736
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,400
humans.

1737
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,799
>> Like while she's not looking like it's

1738
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,920
true.

1739
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:27,520
>> Have you been eating other girlfriends

1740
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,160
without me? Where's my stepdad? Uh,

1741
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,760
>> about that.

1742
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,119
>> Oh, that's who that guy was. I thought

1743
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,880
he was the delivery guy.

1744
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,880
>> Let's see. Zombies meets American

1745
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,880
Psycho.

1746
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,119
>> You've never seen American Psycho? Oh,

1747
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,359
>> Psycho.

1748
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,680
>> He goes around killing random people,

1749
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,920
but he has a girlfriend. I bet he's

1750
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,839
crazy. That's

1751
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,720
psycho,

1752
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:53,720
>> but better.

1753
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:04,000
So necroilia

1754
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:07,440
>> get infected with emotion.

1755
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,480
>> Necroilia infected with love. Brains

1756
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,160
>> love after.

1757
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,960
>> It's a perfect movie. It's a perfect

1758
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,079
game.

1759
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,200
>> All right, guys. I'm going to have you

1760
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,760
uh have you stop. We're going to read

1761
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,240
the other.

1762
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,960
>> Love After Life.

1763
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:22,520
>> I like it. I like it.

1764
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,520
>> That's really good.

1765
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,720
I think that was

1766
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,079
>> that was good.

1767
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,559
>> All right, guys. So, our publisher is

1768
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,559
going to give us so much.

1769
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,559
>> It may it may seem kind of kind of odd

1770
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,319
to have you guys do this brainstorming,

1771
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,920
then what I actually want to talk about

1772
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,200
is rather than the ideas that you came

1773
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,640
up with because I'm sure they're all

1774
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,720
really good.

1775
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,960
>> I know. So, sad. But what what really

1776
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,799
matters is the process, right? Because

1777
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,599
um the point of brainstorming is to

1778
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:54,480
withhold judgment. judging judging which

1779
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,319
of your ideas is best um shouldn't have

1780
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,000
even been happening at this stage. And

1781
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,520
so, you know, one one kind of question,

1782
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,640
you know, we'll come back to what went

1783
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,480
well, but um what what sort of uh

1784
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,160
stumbling blocks did you guys run into

1785
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,480
in this process as you were doing it?

1786
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,839
Did it did it all go perfectly or I

1787
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,960
highly doubt, but what sort of things

1788
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,559
>> I was going to say like we were trying

1789
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:16,319
to design this whole game. So, sometimes

1790
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,839
we say features and they would push

1791
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,400
games.

1792
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,880
Yeah.

1793
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,480
>> So it might have been

1794
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,559
like things you want.

1795
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,480
>> Yeah. Yeah. In some senses it may have

1796
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,319
been constrained in one area, right?

1797
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah. Sure. Zombies and a love story but

1798
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,520
but then it was like asking for a whole

1799
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,200
lot and so it could have been can we

1800
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,640
just brainstorm the title or can we just

1801
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,440
brainstorm this? Can we just brainstorm

1802
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,960
that? What about

1803
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,960
>> we very briefly got sidetracked on

1804
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,960
Pokemon?

1805
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,960
I think I think zombies for a second we

1806
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,359
got like it was like Pokemon only

1807
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,079
Pokemon first person shooter but that

1808
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,160
was like 25 seconds.

1809
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,640
>> Any other thoughts? I mean the whole

1810
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,079
recruit be like your help you had

1811
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,640
personally but if you had any challenges

1812
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:00,319
with like you know

1813
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,599
>> so I feel like if somebody says a really

1814
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,440
good idea and everyone's kind of stuck

1815
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,119
on that idea and you have to kind of get

1816
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,160
through that whole idea before any other

1817
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:10,000
ideas can come out.

1818
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:14,920
>> Yeah. Yeah. It's true.

1819
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,920
like what other kind of noise are there?

1820
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,799
>> Yeah. So like a few other ones.

1821
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:26,480
>> Sure.

1822
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:29,480
>> Kind of hard to like jump in my own

1823
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,480
ideas.

1824
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,480
>> Yeah, it's really hard to brainstorm. I

1825
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:34,000
mean you guys actually I mean both

1826
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,200
groups but I I stopped it with you guys

1827
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,640
and you guys had this interesting kind

1828
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,039
of momentum going and I was watching you

1829
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,480
trying to write it all down. It was it

1830
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,599
was way hard like because like ideas

1831
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,599
were coming in like as you were

1832
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,839
finishing the last idea. So it is you

1833
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,920
know if a group has really good momentum

1834
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,599
it's I I actually I really like the idea

1835
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,599
of having two people where each person's

1836
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,119
writing every other one. Of course the

1837
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,119
difficulty is then you kind of pull two

1838
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,640
people out of contributing right. So

1839
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,799
it's you know the organization of the

1840
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,280
actual group is is kind of important

1841
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,960
that works.

1842
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,079
>> Do you ever recommend using like a tape

1843
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,400
recorder like you're doing for this

1844
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,480
class?

1845
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,920
>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I mean that it's

1846
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,359
it certainly makes sense. One of the

1847
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,119
things that you know, one of the things

1848
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,720
that Osborne says, which I think is

1849
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,039
>> can't put a shape or cord down. Remember

1850
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,119
that.

1851
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,400
>> Yeah. Yeah. But he also says like it's

1852
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,400
the one of the most important things for

1853
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,559
the secretary scribe is to is to number

1854
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,799
things so that you know how many you

1855
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,920
have. I'm sort of like is that is that

1856
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,680
just to support your work? Like be like,

1857
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,680
look, you know, we came up with 110

1858
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,440
ideas. That's amazing. You know, it's

1859
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,359
like how many doesn't seem to matter as

1860
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,559
much as the quality of the ideas. So, um

1861
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,559
I thought it was weird that you said

1862
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,480
that. But um yeah, I mean tape

1863
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,319
recording, video recording, any way of

1864
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,079
documenting the process I think is the

1865
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:41,359
most important problem. Um and and

1866
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,480
actually you know he does make a good

1867
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:44,400
point of saying you know one of the

1868
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,799
problems with brainstorming as it kind

1869
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,319
of evolved from when he first introduced

1870
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,599
it at this one place and when people

1871
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,799
started kind of running with it without

1872
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,319
thinking about the principles is they

1873
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:55,039
would brainstorm and then that was sort

1874
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:56,880
of it and it was like you really have to

1875
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,799
kind of look back at what you've come up

1876
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,799
with. Um it's really important to kind

1877
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:03,280
of reflect on what you've done as a

1878
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:05,119
second step. Um, you know, and so, uh,

1879
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,880
that's kind of important, too. How about

1880
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,119
the judgment thing? Was there I mean,

1881
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,319
people I I didn't notice a whole lot of

1882
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,680
like criticism, but like I don't think

1883
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,440
anybody was really good. I was like, oh,

1884
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,680
that's a terrible idea. But did you find

1885
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,559
it hard to not pass judgment on ideas as

1886
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,960
they were coming out, even your own?

1887
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,760
>> Yeah. I mean, I definitely let more than

1888
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,640
one like, I like that slip, you know,

1889
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,240
like, oh, that's

1890
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,240
>> generally that's okay. I mean like you

1891
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,480
know it's it's you know what you want to

1892
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,400
avoid is like the oh my god we've got to

1893
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,160
do this one you know like that's that

1894
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,839
will that will derail everything because

1895
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,280
then it's like you know just a loud the

1896
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,359
loud voice that proclaims that we're

1897
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,000
done because we got the idea will derail

1898
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,680
things but you know nothing encourages a

1899
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,359
person who's shy more than feeling like

1900
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,000
their idea actually was good or

1901
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,920
meritorious and so yeah you know that

1902
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,440
sort of stuff is fine u you know you

1903
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,359
want to avoid the stop the process

1904
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,039
>> I I think I did say at some point like

1905
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,359
We've got our title which is probably

1906
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,640
not.

1907
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,240
>> Yeah. I mean it's it's really it's just

1908
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,720
a hard thing to kind of train yourself

1909
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,960
from doing.

1910
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,640
>> Come on. Is it necroilia title?

1911
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,079
>> How

1912
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,280
many self-censorers still out there

1913
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:10,160
where a lot of people thought of ideas

1914
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,440
but then just didn't contribute?

1915
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,960
It's good if you didn't. It's great. I

1916
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,640
mean it's great if you if everybody felt

1917
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:19,440
like a cool that's that's really good.

1918
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,440
That's really good. So um so I would say

1919
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,679
that's one thing what that went well.

1920
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,799
What other things went well you guys?

1921
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,000
>> The tagline Yeah, specifically just

1922
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:31,199
coming up with tagline.

1923
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,040
>> Well, just in love

1924
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:34,640
life. Is it love after life?

1925
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,000
>> Love after life.

1926
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,440
>> That's cool. I mean, did you guys feel

1927
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,640
like you had momentum? It seemed to me

1928
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,080
watching that there was momentum

1929
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,080
building that it was

1930
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,080
>> I think you did a really good job of

1931
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,839
taking a lot of different ideas that we

1932
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,520
had and started synthesizing them into

1933
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,880
different things. Oh, that idea would

1934
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,400
work well if we did this. Oh, and then

1935
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,199
we could use like that name and that

1936
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,640
would fit there.

1937
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:53,920
>> Yeah.

1938
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,640
>> Who are the two leaders for the two

1939
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,080
groups? the clips.

1940
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,520
>> Did you did you guys feel like you had

1941
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,359
to do much facilitating

1942
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,719
>> really? So, the hard part is really just

1943
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,560
at the beginning where it's like how do

1944
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,080
we want to just approach this thing? And

1945
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,239
so, I guess we decided to start with the

1946
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,239
title or like it was either the titles

1947
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:12,319
or the main features and we were just

1948
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:15,359
like, all right, let's bunch of random

1949
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,719
titles, see

1950
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:21,520
>> forgot I was the lead.

1951
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,880
>> I didn't lead anything.

1952
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,560
you know, if if you don't have a whole

1953
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,239
lot of facilitating to do, it generally

1954
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,759
means that the group is running. Okay.

1955
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,799
Um, you know, I do think I do think you

1956
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,560
have a good point. A lot of the

1957
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,920
facilitators work comes at the beginning

1958
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,679
of the process or even before the

1959
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,239
process even began, making sure the

1960
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,239
constraints are clear and that you guys

1961
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:40,560
know what you're going to be working on.

1962
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:42,159
Um, okay. So, bringing this back, this

1963
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,359
is a game design class, right? I mean, I

1964
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:46,560
sort of touched on it early, but you

1965
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,640
know, how how do you guys see this um

1966
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,040
being a useful kind of mechanic or

1967
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,560
useful tool in you know what it's funny?

1968
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,239
I call it mechanic. Maybe you catch that

1969
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,159
paragraph in Alex where the guy was

1970
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:58,239
saying when my team feels like they're

1971
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,159
playing, it's a way more productive

1972
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,360
brainstorm than when not. And I thought

1973
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:03,440
that was really interesting, right?

1974
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,320
Because like there are elements of of

1975
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:09,120
giness to this. Um which I think is kind

1976
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,800
of interesting. Um, so you know, how do

1977
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,320
you guys think this could improve, you

1978
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,320
know, the general game design of the

1979
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,320
process?

1980
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,040
>> I feel like after you you have a game

1981
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,520
and you're testing it and there's like a

1982
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,120
major flaw that you know it's taking too

1983
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,640
long or or something like that and

1984
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,960
everyone sits down and brainstorm like

1985
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,440
okay this is exactly what our problem is

1986
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,960
fix it.

1987
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. Kind of overcoming

1988
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,960
roadblocks. Yeah. Sure. never to have

1989
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,360
come up with half the cool ideas that we

1990
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,640
came up with in the process and just me

1991
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,520
thinking alone never to come up with

1992
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,520
like Pokemon zombies.

1993
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:51,280
>> Well, this is good just in general make

1994
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,120
to think up a game because maybe it's

1995
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,520
like oh every single game has been

1996
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,440
decide people made games of all types.

1997
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,440
How am I going to make an unique game?

1998
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,040
It's brainstorm like hm those two things

1999
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,560
I've I've never seen that before. That

2000
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,440
could be interesting. Yeah, and that's a

2001
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,440
really good point actually. The

2002
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,440
synthesis

2003
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,480
thing is is actually I think something

2004
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,640
that's really important, right? Because

2005
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,400
um we do we tend to see a lot of recycle

2006
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,920
mechanics and what what becomes an

2007
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,800
interesting thing in a game often times

2008
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,560
is not that it's a completely new uh

2009
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,080
rule, right? It's the way that rule

2010
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,880
interacts with the other rules in the

2011
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,719
system. Um and and you know in some

2012
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,480
instances also how that rule is read and

2013
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,840
interpreted by the player or perhaps

2014
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,920
intended to be read and interpreted by

2015
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,679
the player. So um yeah, I think the

2016
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,440
synthesis is actually an interesting

2017
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,640
part of it where people can bring a lot

2018
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,199
of different ideas from a lot of

2019
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:43,280
different experiences with games um to

2020
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:45,440
kind of fuse these ideas together. Um

2021
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,880
just uh

2022
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,920
when it comes to coming up with ideas

2023
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,920
for games, nice thing about

2024
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,320
brainstorming is that it gets past the

2025
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,400
good idea that everyone happens to like.

2026
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:57,520
uh which is uh a problem that we

2027
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,840
sometimes have in the SP is people the

2028
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:02,640
people will find one idea they will

2029
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,800
never think past it that's because they

2030
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,719
were happy to find one that everybody

2031
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,840
>> yeah and so you guys are dividing into

2032
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,440
design teams and one of the things that

2033
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,719
I would encourage I don't know how it's

2034
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:15,600
set up schedule-wise but try to try to

2035
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,040
divide the brainstorming process from

2036
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,600
the judgment you know like I kind of

2037
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,840
said it's it's true like even even if

2038
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,360
you do the brainstorm it can help you

2039
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,040
get over. But a lot of times whatever

2040
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,560
had momentum during that brainstorm or

2041
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,400
whatever got the most yuck during that

2042
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,400
brainstorm, right, is going to be like

2043
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,760
the popular strong idea. And then when

2044
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,360
you come back to it with a little space,

2045
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,640
you might be like, "Oh, you know, like,

2046
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,679
yeah, that is a really good idea, but

2047
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,199
there was this other thing that got

2048
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,480
mentioned like a half an hour earlier

2049
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,159
that's really interesting. Maybe we

2050
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,320
could incorporate that somehow." And so

2051
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:44,640
kind of, you know, making the judgment

2052
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,880
happen in a in a separate phase can be

2053
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,560
really important. Um because it's true,

2054
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,719
creativity is like this, it's a little

2055
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,360
bit more organic. It's not necessarily a

2056
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:56,880
a strictly logical process, right? Um so

2057
01:12:53,360 --> 01:13:00,320
applying logic later can be a good thing

2058
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,840
I think to the creative process.

2059
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,760
Cool. Any questions about brainstorming

2060
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:09,239
at all? You are incredibly enlightened

2061
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,239
by Alex Osbor

2062
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,000
on the forum actually people reading

2063
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,080
about using things like Google or Google

2064
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Docs where things are automatically

2065
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,239
recorded because everyone's basically

2066
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,840
typing in their years.

2067
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:24,320
>> Yeah. I mean, I think it's interesting.

2068
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:27,520
I I don't have a whole lot of experience

2069
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,280
with Well, I should reframe. Um I I

2070
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,760
Well, I don't have a lot of experience

2071
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:34,880
with remote brainstorming, but I did

2072
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,320
have a um I did, you know, so one of the

2073
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,440
games I worked on this summer was this

2074
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,880
game called Yet One Word where um you

2075
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,239
were asked a lot of personal questions.

2076
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,760
And so, we had to think of personal

2077
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,880
questions. And at one, so we were like,

2078
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,640
well, if you have ideas, write it down

2079
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,920
in Google Doc. And at one point myself

2080
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,679
and two of the other designers were all

2081
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,199
in the Google doc at the same time. And

2082
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,640
you could actually see it that sort of

2083
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,080
brainstorming momentum happen. Someone

2084
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,920
would type something in and then like

2085
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,840
someone would type next like a that's so

2086
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,520
funny and then like write an idea that's

2087
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,760
related to that, right? And and you're

2088
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,679
kind of seeing it happen in this digital

2089
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,840
space. So I think it can we've gotten so

2090
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,760
accustomed to having these kind of um

2091
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,400
digital personalities, right? these

2092
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,920
digital personas in IMing and text

2093
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,360
messaging and all that other stuff that

2094
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,040
I I think we've gotten pretty adept at

2095
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,800
typing fast enough to get ideas out. But

2096
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,000
I think it could totally work. Um

2097
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,760
there's something to be said for like

2098
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,159
the momentum that gets generated in

2099
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,600
person. Um but yeah, I mean

2100
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,640
>> yeah I mean I was it's so funny. I was

2101
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,840
going to say like no that's a terrible

2102
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,640
idea you have to be around each other. I

2103
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,840
was like actually it worked. Um, I mean

2104
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,960
I think it all depends a little bit on

2105
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,480
personalities and people that are

2106
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,640
involved.

2107
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,000
Certainly for a prolonged brainstorm you

2108
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,719
one of the things Alex Osbourne says is

2109
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,840
like time box it if if you you know if

2110
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,199
you don't time box it's going to be a

2111
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,159
problem. I think for in person that's

2112
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:46,080
true. Um you know it's so easy to get

2113
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,400
onto a Google document now whenever you

2114
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,880
have an idea that actually having kind

2115
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,560
of a long phone brainstorm where anytime

2116
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,800
someone has an idea over a week or

2117
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,320
something like that write it down. um

2118
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,600
you know that's also useful too because

2119
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,440
then you know you separated the

2120
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:03,360
processes collecting and then but you

2121
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,800
still should do that sort of building on

2122
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,480
ideas.

2123
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,560
>> It's probably easier to do those

2124
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,960
synthesis when you're at least

2125
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,679
simultaneously on the line online or in

2126
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,760
the same room.

2127
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,000
>> Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And to see the ideas

2128
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,640
come out as they come out.

2129
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,159
>> Yeah. It's it's kind of it's a little

2130
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,880
uncommon to just read something and be

2131
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:24,719
like, "Oh, yeah. What about this when it

2132
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,640
first shows up?" When it first kind of

2133
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:29,040
comes into existence as you're trying to

2134
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:31,520
think of things that can spur ideas, you

2135
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,360
know, the other danger about doing it

2136
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,040
like, "Okay, this document is open for

2137
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,800
the next 24 hours. Everyone throw your

2138
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,040
ideas in." Is that then people start

2139
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,159
spending too long on any one idea

2140
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,920
thinking about what they're going to

2141
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:44,159
write down before they write it down and

2142
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,239
it's like, "No, that's not the point."

2143
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. Think of the paperclip

2144
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,640
experience and those of you that raised

2145
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,880
your hand for saying that you were

2146
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,000
self-censoring on your own. Like you

2147
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,679
didn't even have to I wasn't going to

2148
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,880
make you all hand in those paperclip

2149
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,480
ideas and you were self-censoring,

2150
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,840
right? So yeah, the same same sort of

2151
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,280
thing applies. Like you might you might

2152
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,679
censor yourself or spend a lot of time

2153
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:04,960
on ideas. So

2154
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:06,719
yeah, any other thoughts, questions?

2155
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,000
Cool. Well, I hope this was helpful. I

2156
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,480
hope it'll be helpful for your game

2157
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,840
design stuff. Um, email me if you do

2158
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,080
have any questions about this stuff. I

2159
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,239
mean, I can try to try to help out, but

2160
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,400
you know,

2161
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:20,000
other than that, good luck on your your

2162
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,760
game design for this class and for the

2163
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,760
rest of the cool.

2164
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:32,440
I do like that on the the keynote

2165
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,440
things. It says end of show.

2166
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:40,000
>> Uh let's see now. Uh we're going to play

2167
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,040
some card games, but before that, just a

2168
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,280
little bit of admin. Um on Monday you'll

2169
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,960
notice that uh we had two readings, one

2170
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,520
of which you've already done. So it

2171
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:52,719
doesn't matter. Um this is the other

2172
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,520
reading. It's a little bit dry. Tough it

2173
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:58,400
out. Caffeinate yourself reading it.

2174
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,560
Tough it out. It is worth it. It's

2175
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:05,480
translation. So

2176
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,480
uh let's see now. Um

2177
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:12,320
there there's at least one person um

2178
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,840
who hasn't form that we need to fill

2179
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,719
out.

2180
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,280
So just just come up here

2181
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,760
if

2182
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,120
at least four

2183
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,000
more time.

2184
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,440
>> Yeah, I'm not sure if we have enough to

2185
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,400
get through all of them, but most of

2186
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,159
them are pretty short. Uh uh a lot of

2187
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,239
them the delay is going to be set up

2188
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:36,560
which is why they couldn't first because

2189
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:38,960
uh uh that takes a lot of set up. That

2190
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:42,080
being said, um if you do get a chance to

2191
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:44,960
look at a rule and study the cards, um

2192
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,800
what like even though they've done a

2193
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,560
bunch of really really smart things on

2194
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,960
the cards just to make it easier for you

2195
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:54,000
to set up uh and you want to kind of

2196
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,560
paying attention to that, but the the

2197
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,719
the aim of the today is pretty much just

2198
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,800
variety. We have four fairly different

2199
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:04,000
kinds of games that use cards in a very

2200
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,600
different way. Uh and if you don't get a

2201
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,040
chance necessarily to play all of them,

2202
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,640
at least get a chance to look at other

2203
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,840
people playing with them and if you

2204
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,199
wanted to like check them out in the

2205
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,800
middle of the week or something just

2206
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,400
kick around the office but you know your

2207
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,800
time to come back here next week or

2208
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,400
something

2209
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,199
but uh that's basically it if we can

2210
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:25,280
just keep um uh if we can clear the

2211
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:25,280
tables we need them for the cards uh
