[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:09,670

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,270
I think we're really at the
beginning of a whole new era

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,370
of biological
understanding, and one

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,340
where I think MIT
is really extremely

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,190
well-positioned to lead.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,910
The planet is changing, and
new diseases are coming.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,920
The things that we
thought we were treating

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,430
are changing in real time, which
as inventors, is an opportunity.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,190
But it's really
a call to action.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,470
Things that might have
taken years in the past

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,220
can be done in weeks,
if not days, using

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,110
the power of computation.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,950
And what better place to
invest in technology than MIT.

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,710
At MIT, it's not
simply the discovery

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,130
that's up at the top
of our ambition list.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,920
It's also applications
of those discoveries

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,130
to making the world
better, to coming up

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,260
with better products,
better ways to do things.

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,510
One of the things that
we're excited always

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,670
to collaborate with our
colleagues at MIT around

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,300
is how do we make big leaps?

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,200
How do we make daring
departures from what

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,740
is obvious and adjacent?

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,930
And that's where many of
the breakthroughs come from.

27
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,510
We want to find a
mechanism to bring people

28
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,000
from lots of different
areas together so we

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,640
can get this synergistic
effect to solve

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,300
really important problems.

31
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,600
There's been a
natural confluence

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,870
of the science, the
medicine, the capital,

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,730
and the entrepreneurs.

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,580
And that doesn't exist
anywhere else in the world.

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,020
And MIT has been focal to that.

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,600
Being in this environment
allows us then

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,000
to tie into that ecosystem and
to learn from them in terms

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,580
of understanding
how best the work

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,220
we do can be applied outside.

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,830
But vice versa, it allows
them to have access

41
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,630
to how we're thinking
about pushing

42
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,610
the boundaries of the future.

43
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,440
And so that's one
of the many reasons

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,770
that we are launching MIT HEALS.

45
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,290
Anyone who has spent
any time at MIT

46
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,370
knows this place
has a secret sauce.

47
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,070
And I love so much that
we can now combine that

48
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,070
with the strength that
the hospitals, with all

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,180
of the remarkable industry
connections in Kendall Square

50
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,330
to really move health and
life sciences forward in ways

51
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,090
that we can only imagine.

52
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,040
[MUSIC PLAYING]

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:49,430

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,330
All right.

55
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,600
Good morning again.

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,260
So I'm Sally Kornbluth,
President of MIT,

57
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,220
and I'm delighted to welcome you
to the launch of the MIT Health

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,930
and Life Sciences Collaborative,
or simply MIT HEALS.

59
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,700
I'll have more to say about
MIT HEALS in a moment.

60
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,890
But first, it's my honor to
introduce a very special guest

61
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,090
this morning.

62
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,180
Since she was elected to the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts

63
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,730
just two years ago,
Governor Maura Healey

64
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,790
has focused on making the
state a leader in clean energy,

65
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,860
a more affordable place to live,
and a great place for businesses

66
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,880
of all kinds to start,
grow, and succeed.

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,090
Here at MIT, we
especially appreciate

68
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,940
her personal
enthusiasm and advocacy

69
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,510
for the state's interlocking
innovation ecosystems,

70
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,600
from climate technology
and advanced manufacturing,

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,040
to AI and the life sciences.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,440
So we cannot be more delighted
to have her with us today as we

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,410
launch MIT HEALS.

74
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,820
Please join me in offering a
warm welcome to Massachusetts

75
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,055
Governor Maura Healey.

76
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:57,404
[APPLAUSE]

77
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:03,860

78
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,880
Well, good morning.

79
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,910
And thank you so much,
President Kornbluth.

80
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,940
Belated happy birthday to you.

81
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,490
Look, I got word that
this was happening,

82
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:19,760
and I never want to miss an
opportunity to visit MIT.

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
And I mean that.

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,080
So to all of you who are
here, Madame President,

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,280
distinguished faculty,
scientists and leaders

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,450
from across this
great university,

87
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,350
thank you for all that you do.

88
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,140
And thank you for
all that you're

89
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,990
going to do because today is
about what you're going to do.

90
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,380
And it's so, so exciting.

91
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,230
Congratulations on this
launch of MIT HEALS.

92
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,930
I love that title and
what it encapsulates.

93
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,560
I was also delighted
to have a moment

94
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,860
with your co-chairs of
this morning's symposium,

95
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,800
Dr. Amy Keating and
Katharina Ribbeck.

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,970
Lovely to meet you
both, although Amy and I

97
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,310
go way back because we went
to that other school down,

98
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,220
down the way.

99
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,680
One of the things as governor
that I really appreciate

100
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,720
is the opportunity
to see so many

101
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,570
of our state's
accomplished scientists

102
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,480
and brightest minds
come together,

103
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,410
work together, and
forge a new commitment

104
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,540
to improving human life.

105
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,420
It's even more exciting when
you think about this convening

106
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,310
to think about all the
amazing cures and treatments

107
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,670
and discoveries that
will result from it.

108
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,965
And I'm proud to say, and
I really believe this.

109
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,970
This is something that can
only happen in Massachusetts.

110
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,050
There's no place that has the
ecosystem that we have here.

111
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,470
We must fight hard to
always protect that

112
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,430
and to nurture that.

113
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,180
But we have the
greatest scientists

114
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,060
in the world, the greatest
universities, the greatest

115
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,910
hospitals.

116
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,600
We're number one for
innovation, for education,

117
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,870
and for health care.

118
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,670
And we draw top talent
from all over the globe.

119
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,320
We believe in solving
hard problems.

120
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,220
We, in fact, embrace
solving hard problems.

121
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,910
And this university
has always been

122
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,820
about thinking of ways to
reduce suffering, help humanity,

123
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,030
and further the common good.

124
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,080
We also are home to-- and
I find this remarkable.

125
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,950
Four of the 12 Nobel
Prize winners this year.

126
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,860
Four are from Massachusetts
and of course, two

127
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,760
are from this great university.

128
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,030
And it's just another
indication of Massachusetts

129
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,730
and this ecosystem always
punching above its weight,

130
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,310
so to speak.

131
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,240
This is what gives us
and distinguishes us

132
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,480
among global competition, both
for talent and for innovation

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,450
and for output.

134
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,070
It's why I also worked hard to
go out and recruit and appoint

135
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,380
Yvonne Hao as a leader
in an innovation economy,

136
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,320
to come and lead economic
development for the state.

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,820
I appointed Kate Walsh to be our
Secretary of Health and Human

138
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,180
Services, a leader of one of our
world-class teaching hospitals.

139
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,520
It's why we worked
hard, many in this room,

140
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,680
to go out and get after and
win the Investor Catalyst

141
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,050
Hub in ARPA-H, which is
the federal government's

142
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,640
new medical discovery agency.

143
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,260
And it's why in our new economic
development law that I recently

144
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,500
signed, we are making a
transformative commitment

145
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,000
as a state to the Mass
Life Sciences Initiative.

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,120
This has made us a global
leader and our charge

147
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,810
is to lengthen that lead.

148
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,360
And it's one of the
reasons I'm here

149
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
to say thank you because
what you are doing

150
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,640
in furthering aligns with
our state's interests

151
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,600
and where we want to go.

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,690
That includes also investments
in making Massachusetts

153
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,110
the global hub for climate
technology and for applied AI

154
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,060
and all sorts of things that
you are already ahead of us on.

155
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,840
But we are looking forward
to sync up and support

156
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,470
what you are doing.

157
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,970
And it's not by accident.

158
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,100
This is who we are
in Massachusetts.

159
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,250
We don't just believe in
science, we lead in science.

160
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,870
And we also know that that
requires intentionality

161
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,977
and effort every single day.

162
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:13,310
And that's what you do in
your classrooms, in your labs,

163
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,760
and other spaces.

164
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,450
And when I say "we,"
make no mistake about it.

165
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,020
I mean, you-- the scientists,
the brains, the researchers,

166
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,800
the students of
the Massachusetts

167
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,550
Institute of Technology.

168
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,380
And as President
Kornbluth knows,

169
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,593
MIT and the state
of Massachusetts,

170
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,010
the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts,

171
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,039
have a long and very
connected history.

172
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,149
So thank you for
all that you do.

173
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,799

174
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,480
I think that the MIT
HEALS initiative really

175
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,930
reflects the strengths
of our state,

176
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,350
in some really profound
and important ways,

177
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,480
and in ways that we
know are particularly

178
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,860
critical at this moment as we
once again affirm collectively

179
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,820
our commitment and indeed
reverence for science,

180
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,540
for knowledge, for
innovation, for collaboration,

181
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,480
and for partnerships
that will really

182
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,100
help us transcend in time.

183
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,490
In this moment in our nation's
history and our world's history,

184
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,430
your leadership and
the work that you do

185
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,660
is more important than ever.

186
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,450
I cannot wait to see
the results of it.

187
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,240
I look forward with my team to
getting out to various things

188
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,270
you have happening related
to this wonderful, wonderful

189
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,030
effort.

190
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,620
And I just thank you for
being here in Massachusetts

191
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,950
and making not only our
state better but our country

192
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,760
and indeed our world better.

193
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,042
So enjoy the rest of this
wonderful, wonderful day.

194
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,500
And thank you,
President Kornbluth.
