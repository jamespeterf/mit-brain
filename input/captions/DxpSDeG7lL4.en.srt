1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,199
right, everybody. Uh, welcome back to

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,119
class. [clears throat] So, today we're

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
going to pick up where we left off. So,

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,560
remember last time we talked about the

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,279
pigeonal principle. I showed you a whole

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,359
bunch of applications of it and then we

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,960
started this longer topic that's going

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,960
to take us a couple lectures which is

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
probability. Um so just a quick recap of

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
where we left off last time. So last

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,800
time I started to introduce the basic

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,879
terminology that we need for

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
probability. We had these key

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,680
definitions like we had the notion of a

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,840
sample space which is really just

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,239
telling you what are all the possible

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
outcomes of your experiment. You could

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,920
think about something, you know, very

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,800
small and finite, like I roll a dieice

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,399
and I get a number between one and six.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,680
Or you could even think about a sample

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,840
space as being an infinite space. For

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,880
purposes of our class, we're only going

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,119
to consider discrete sample spaces. But

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,680
you can even consider sample spaces like

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,840
what happens if I take a coin and I flip

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
it as many times until I get my first

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,479
heads. That's something which has an

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
infinite sample space. And what's

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,720
important is that to the sample space we

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,000
associate what's called a probability

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,400
measure P. So all this does is it takes

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,799
in some particular outcome from the

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
range of all possible outcomes. It

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
better assign a non- negative

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,720
probability to that. And additionally

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,360
your probability measure had better be

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,400
normalized so that the sum of P of X

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,479
over your entire sample space had better

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,079
be normalized so that it's equal to one.

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,240
Right? So that these probabilities make

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
sense. In fact, there are a lot of

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,479
distributions that we're going to see

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,560
over and over again. One of the simplest

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,360
and most ubiquitous distributions is

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,960
called the uniform distribution. So here

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,799
we have some finite sample space S. And

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
then we just look at the probability

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,080
measure that assigns the same fixed

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,080
probability to every possible outcome.

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
So in particular, in order for it to be

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,080
normalized, each of those probabilities

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,920
had better be one over the size of S. So

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
this is where we left off last time. We

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,879
also define this notion of what an event

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,959
was. You know, sometimes we're not

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,520
interested in one particular outcome,

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,200
but really a collection of outcomes.

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,760
Something like when I take a dieice and

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,239
I roll it and I get an even number.

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,319
That's not just any one atomic outcome,

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,879
but it's really three outcomes for two,

64
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,120
four, and six. And we talk about the

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,879
probability of an event as really just

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
being the sum of the probability

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,200
measured over all of the outcomes that

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,800
land in the subset t. So this is where

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
we left off last time. And um you know

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
today what we're really working towards

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
is we're going to talk about something

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
that's very important but a little bit

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,040
counterintuitive.

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,920
We're going to talk about independence

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,319
and conditioning. So what's important to

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,159
build up to this is really the idea that

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,640
you know we cannot just consider the

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,000
probabilities of individual events but

79
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,959
we can combine them in interesting ways.

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,440
Right? So for example if I give you two

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,319
events T1 and T2 I can think about the

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,319
union of T1 and T2. What this means is

83
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,040
I'm really just treating this as the set

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,120
of outcomes I'm interested in. This is

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,360
another set of possible outcomes I'm

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,319
interested in. And I'm forming a new

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,680
event that takes everything that happens

88
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,920
in either one of these or maybe both. So

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,200
in particular, in words, what does this

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,920
new event that I've constructed mean?

91
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:57,280
It's the event that at least

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:58,799
one of these events, T1 or T2, happened,

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,760
right?

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,760
So that's one way to combine events. I

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,799
could also think about combining events

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,239
by for example taking T1 intersect T2

97
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,840
and then what am I going to get? I'm

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,519
going to get a new event that's asking

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,040
me whether both T1 and T2 happened.

100
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,959
Right?

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,120
And so this now leads to a very

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,160
interesting concept which is the notion

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,639
of conditional probability.

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,240
And I promise that um [clears throat]

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,320
you know this will sound very simple but

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,960
in the examples we'll see some of them

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
will become pretty counterintuitive.

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
In fact you know when you look

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,040
conditional probability is really in the

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,880
world all around you in very important

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
ways. We'll talk about some real world

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,120
examples. So first let me tell you what

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
this means. Let me just give you the

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
definition.

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,440
We can also combine two events A and B

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,840
in this interesting way where we want to

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,400
assert for a fact that event B really

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,960
did happen and we want to look at if I

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,720
tell you that event B happened what's

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,840
the new probability that this other

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,560
event A happened. So you can think about

122
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,400
this you know in a few different ways.

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:19,440
So it's in words it's the probability

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,960
of event A given or conditioned on that

125
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,919
event

126
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,919
B happens

127
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,039
see one way to think about this is

128
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,280
really in terms of pictures right

129
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,919
so we could start off with our full

130
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,759
sample space S that's all of the

131
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:42,000
different possibilities

132
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,680
we could take one event a right here.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,680
And what's going on is that, you know,

134
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,880
our probability measure really describes

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,680
a way of throwing a dart at this board.

136
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Now, this dart always lands inside this

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,160
box S because that's the range of all

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,919
possible outcomes.

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,919
And then the probability of the event A

140
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,400
is just the probability that that dart

141
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,880
lands inside this oval that I've drawn

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,319
right here. So now when I have a pair of

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,639
events and I have A and B right here.

144
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,560
Well, what I can do is imagine I do this

145
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,039
experiment where I throw my dart at the

146
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,000
board and we already know it has to land

147
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,360
inside the set S. But then what if I

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,319
tell you that it's landed in the set B

149
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
and I promise you that event B happens.

150
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,720
What I want to know is given that

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,919
promise, what's the new probability that

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,080
it actually lands inside the set A? So

153
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,240
the only place where it could then land

154
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
an event A could happen is right here in

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,440
the intersection. And that's exactly how

156
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,520
we define the conditional probability,

157
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,080
it's literally just the probability of

158
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,479
the intersection of the two events

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
divided by the probability that I'm

160
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,720
conditioning on. And this part is

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,960
intuitive. You know, imagine that I have

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,639
the same chance of hitting every single

163
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,560
point inside this rectangle, right? Then

164
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,440
really what's going on is that when I

165
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,199
tell you that event B has happened, you

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,080
know, the probability of B is how I'm

167
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,120
renormalizing my space of possible

168
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,240
outcomes because I know that now my dart

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,160
is uniform over the set B. And what's

170
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,199
important is not the amount of space

171
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,919
that A takes up inside S, but the amount

172
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,039
of space that A intersect B takes up

173
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,800
inside B. So does this make sense? Are

174
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,919
there any questions about the definition

175
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,919
of conditional probability?

176
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,599
Good. All right. So, let's develop a few

177
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,199
different ways to think about

178
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
conditional probability. Let me actually

179
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,840
give one other simple example which is

180
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,160
related to it um which will have its own

181
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,800
quirks. The other crucial notion that um

182
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,800
I want to introduce today is the notion

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
of independence.

184
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,240
So we talked about two events you know A

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,919
and B and you know there's this very

186
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,560
important concept which we're going to

187
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,919
use all the time which is called

188
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:12,280
independence. So we say that two events

189
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,280
A and B are independent

190
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:25,199
if the probability of A intersect B is

191
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,319
equal to the probability of A times the

192
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,400
probability of B. So this is in some

193
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,479
sense the simplest way that the

194
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,039
probability of intersecting two events

195
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,120
could work is that you know whether A

196
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,080
happens you think of it as you know it

197
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,519
it contributes this P of A and whether B

198
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,720
happens contributes this P of B.

199
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,839
But in fact just as an exercise you know

200
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,560
um using our definition for conditional

201
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,120
probability we can see that you know

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,040
independence is really equivalent to a

203
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,360
much simpler thing which is that

204
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,320
probability of A given B is equal to the

205
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,560
probability of A. Right?

206
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
So this comes just from dividing through

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,040
by the probability of B and using my

208
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,360
definition for conditional independence.

209
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,600
So these are two completely equivalent

210
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,519
conditions. You can check either one.

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,240
And that's what it means for two things

212
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,240
to be independent. So what's going on is

213
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,279
that in my dartboard example, you know,

214
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,480
in pictures, I might have my entire

215
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,519
rectangle represents S. I might have

216
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,720
this left half represents A and maybe

217
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,440
this bottom half represents B. And so

218
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,000
what's going on is, you know, if I look

219
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,640
at the probability of A, that's how much

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,279
area this rectangle for A takes up out

221
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,120
of the entire rectangle. But then when I

222
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,760
condition on B, it doesn't change what

223
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,560
that fraction is. So this is one way to

224
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,000
think about what independence is. And I

225
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
want to caution you that even though

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,519
it's a very simple definition, it's

227
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
actually very counterintuitive in some

228
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,560
ways. there are, you know, easy pairs of

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,640
events that are natural to think about

230
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,080
why they're independent. And then there

231
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
are some events that are independent

232
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,959
that are very counterintuitive.

233
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,800
So let's do the simple one first. Let's

234
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,680
do some simple examples to get some

235
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,720
intuition for independence.

236
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:24,320
So imagine that uh we throw

237
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,640
a dice twice

238
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,880
and this is a fair die. So it's the

239
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,800
uniform distribution over all six

240
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
possibilities.

241
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,120
And when I look at, you know, the pair

242
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,800
of throws, my sample space now has 36

243
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,440
possibilities.

244
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,760
For every possibility for the first

245
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,640
throw X1, every possibility for the

246
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,160
second row X2. So I look at all

247
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,079
possibilities of X1, X2 that are in this

248
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,079
set

249
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,560
one, two up to six. Right? So this is my

250
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,760
sample space and everything is uniform

251
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,519
over the sample space. All of the 36

252
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,440
possibilities for the choice of some

253
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,440
number between 1 and six and some number

254
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,560
between 1 and six are all equally

255
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,720
likely. And now I can define some

256
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,399
events.

257
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Let's look at events A

258
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,920
which is that X1 is odd.

259
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,120
And let's look at the event that B that

260
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,720
X2 is at most three.

261
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,279
So probably you all have very good

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
intuition for this. So who thinks uh

263
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,959
these two events A and B are

264
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,120
independent?

265
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:44,320
Okay. Who thinks they're not?

266
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Who is still tired?

267
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,800
Okay. All right. Good honesty. All

268
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,720
right. So these two are independent. Now

269
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,360
uh one way to check independence is

270
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,079
literally just to follow the definition.

271
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,079
So when in doubt just compute the thing,

272
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,920
right? But we're going to see, you know,

273
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,320
part of the intuition for why they're

274
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,560
independent. We'll see in in the

275
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,120
computation itself, right? So what does

276
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,760
it mean to be independent? Let's check.

277
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Let's look at the probability of A and

278
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,680
B. So in our sample space, there are 36

279
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,320
possibilities. How many possibilities

280
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,040
meet the condition that both event A and

281
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,040
event B hold?

282
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,839
Not a hard question. Yeah. A quarter of

283
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,839
them. Yeah. So, let me just say nine out

284
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,040
of 36.

285
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,720
Why is it nine? Because I have three

286
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,000
possibilities for X1 is odd, right? 1

287
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,040
35. I have three possibilities for X2 is

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,720
at most three one two three and every

289
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,839
choice of you know one of the

290
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,720
possibilities for A and every choice for

291
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,880
one of the possibilities of B defines a

292
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,279
possible outcome that satisfies both A

293
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,519
and B. So they're independent because

294
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,160
they have this kind of product structure

295
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,680
that you know whatever happens for A you

296
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
know I can choose something there and

297
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,839
then I can define something that happens

298
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,560
for B. So literally if you think about

299
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,120
it, it really represents this picture if

300
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,000
you think about it the right way. So in

301
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,480
any case we can check that um this

302
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,880
really does you know equal the

303
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,360
probability of A times the probability

304
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,920
of B because what's the probability of

305
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,880
A? It's just a half. A half of the rolls

306
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,959
are odd. What's the probability of B?

307
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,279
It's a half because a half of them or

308
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,600
three or less.

309
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,519
So the way to think about it is that um

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,720
you know independence is sometimes

311
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,720
intuitive because you know what's going

312
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,839
on here is I could literally think about

313
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,000
rolling two separate dice, right? I roll

314
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,480
one dice here and I care about what the

315
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,880
role is and then you go to another room

316
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,560
in building two and you roll another die

317
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,480
and they're independent because we

318
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
literally are not talking to each other,

319
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120
right? These events are just happening

320
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,600
in different spaces. But independence is

321
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,519
a bit more counterintuitive than that

322
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,360
because there are other ways that events

323
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,240
can be independent that satisfy our

324
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,639
definition that aren't so easy to check.

325
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,360
Let me also mention that um you know a

326
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,920
lot of times we use the shorthands which

327
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
just means that A and B are independent

328
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,160
as events.

329
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
All right. So let's go a little further

330
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,639
with this example so that I can convince

331
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,240
you that independence is subtle. So

332
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:38,880
let's define a new event C which is

333
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,880
going to be the event X1 - X2 is equal

334
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,199
to 3.

335
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,680
Now this is a bit stranger of an event

336
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,680
because you know it involves both X1 and

337
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,320
X2. Right? Now what are the possible

338
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,240
outcomes in the sample space where event

339
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,199
C happens? Can anyone list them for me?

340
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,959
>> Yeah.

341
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,000
>> Perfect. And those are the only

342
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,320
possibilities. So another way to define

343
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,560
this event is really as the subset of

344
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,839
the sample space which we're interested

345
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,000
in which is the possibility 41. It's the

346
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,600
possibility 52.

347
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,600
And lastly we have the possibility 63.

348
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,959
That's the only subset of the sample

349
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
space that I'm interested in. Those are

350
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,720
the only things that can happen where

351
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,480
this event C is on is true.

352
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,959
And we can look at the same type of

353
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,120
thing. Let's look at our definition for

354
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,560
independence. Let's look at the

355
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,560
probability that A and C both happen. So

356
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,000
what was A? X1 is odd. And there's only

357
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,120
one possibility on my list where X1 is

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,759
odd and C happens. So this means the

359
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,600
probability of my intersection is 1 over

360
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,480
36.

361
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,880
Unfortunately, this is not equal to the

362
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,519
probability of A times the probability

363
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,480
of C. We know the probability of A is a

364
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,920
half and we know the probability of C is

365
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,560
3 over 36 just based on our description

366
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,720
of the event. So these two events A and

367
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,839
C are not independent, right? A is not

368
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,920
independent from C. And maybe this is

369
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,639
intuitive too because you know these two

370
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,759
events depend on the same things. They

371
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,000
both depend on what happens for RO one,

372
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,959
right? But what I claim is that there

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,800
are slight changes, you know, to event C

374
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,920
that actually make these things be

375
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,720
independent. Let's define a fourth and

376
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,519
final event. Let's look at this event D.

377
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,959
That's X1 - X2 is equal to four instead

378
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,360
of three. Now we have only two

379
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,040
possibilities. We have the possibility

380
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,480
51 and we have the possibility 62.

381
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,720
Right?

382
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
And we can just check our definition for

383
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,480
independence.

384
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,959
So the probability of A and D. Well,

385
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,720
there's only one thing that survives. So

386
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,760
my probability of the intersection is

387
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,679
still 1 over 36.

388
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,839
And you can check that this really is

389
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,079
equal to the probability of A which is a

390
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:19,520
half times the probability of D which is

391
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,360
2 over 36. Right?

392
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,120
So this is an example which would be a

393
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,160
little bit hard to guess unless you

394
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,160
literally did the calculation because it

395
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,960
doesn't look like they're independent

396
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,200
but they still are. So are there any

397
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,600
questions about independence?

398
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,559
Does this make sense?

399
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Okay. All right. So let's go a little

400
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,679
further.

401
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,679
I want to tell you about um some more

402
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,400
powerful tools of probability that play

403
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,880
very nicely with conditioning and

404
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
independence.

405
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
Let me tell you about this basic fact

406
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,559
that we're going to use all over the

407
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,000
place and then I'll give you a way to

408
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:04,679
visualize it. This fact is called the

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,679
law of total probability.

410
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,320
Even though we already defined whatever

411
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,559
we need just in terms of like the sample

412
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,000
space and the probability measure, there

413
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,320
are a lot of tricks that are going to

414
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
happen where you know there are clever

415
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,360
ways to compute probabilities that don't

416
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,360
involve listing the entire sample space

417
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,600
and just adding things up in a boring

418
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,679
way. So a lot of these tools are really

419
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,919
a way to organize and think about the

420
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,000
sample space to try and make probability

421
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,559
more intuitive.

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,440
And the you know the basic version of

423
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,160
the law of total probability is that if

424
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,160
I have an event A and I care about its

425
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,760
probability right we already have a

426
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,280
definition for how to compute that

427
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,320
probability just by going over the

428
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,400
entire sample space. But what I claim is

429
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,559
that we can break it up into two

430
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,280
different terms. one where a and b both

431
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,799
happen and then I can add in the

432
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,480
probability that a happens and b does

433
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,240
not happen. Right? So this is just if

434
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,080
I'm interested in the probability that a

435
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,039
happens well you know either a happens

436
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,679
and b happens or a happens and b doesn't

437
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,080
happen. These together cover the space

438
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,039
of all things that could happen so that

439
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,840
a still occurs and they don't overlap at

440
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,919
all. So in particular the proof of this

441
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,160
is you know there really is no proof.

442
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,360
It's literally just we take the

443
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,120
definition of what the probability of A

444
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,240
is. It's the sum over all X in my set A

445
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,880
of P of X. And all I'm doing is I'm

446
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,520
breaking this sum up into two pieces.

447
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,640
It's the sum over all x in a and b of p

448
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:57,760
of x. That's literally this right here.

449
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:01,280
Plus the sum over all x in a and not b

450
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,760
of probability of x. Right? And so

451
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,480
pictorially we can go back to our you

452
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,200
know favorite diagram. We have this

453
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,280
event A that we care about. We have this

454
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,320
other event B. And then we can break up

455
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,039
this event A into two pieces. One where

456
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:24,240
A happens and B does not and one where

457
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,919
A happens and B does and together they

458
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,600
cover the space. Right? So in fact

459
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
there's an even fancier version of the

460
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
law of total probability because no one

461
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,000
says you have to do this with one other

462
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,720
event. In fact you can do this with a

463
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,720
ton of other events. Right? So let's

464
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,720
talk about the most general version.

465
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,200
of the law of total probability.

466
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,240
We can be interested in the probability

467
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,080
of some event A and we can write this as

468
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,880
the sum over a collection of other

469
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,280
events of the probability of A and B I

470
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,720
but now we need some conditions on the

471
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:08,640
BI's. We need that all of the BI's are

472
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,720
disjoint. So B I intersect BJ is the

473
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,799
empty set for I not equal to J. They're

474
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,200
pair-wise disjoint.

475
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,640
And we also need that together they

476
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,240
cover the entire space. The union of all

477
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,000
of these BIS is my sample space. So in

478
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,520
particular for this most general

479
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,919
definition for the law of total

480
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,760
probability really the way that I

481
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,960
recover that special case we already

482
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,600
talked about is I consider two events B1

483
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,760
and B2 and B2 is the complement of B1.

484
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,960
And that way I just get two terms in the

485
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,360
sum. They're definitely disjoint. B1 and

486
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,679
its complement don't intersect and

487
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,919
together they cover the space. But

488
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,880
instead of breaking up my entire sample

489
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,640
space into only two possibilities, I can

490
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,240
think about breaking it up into three,

491
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,320
four, five, how many ever is convenient.

492
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,720
So any questions about the law of total

493
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,240
probability.

494
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,400
Good.

495
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,600
All right.

496
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,400
So let's uh go back to visualizing these

497
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,000
things. I I want to try to make these

498
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,919
things as intuitive as possible.

499
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,760
So in fact there's a clever way to think

500
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,000
about them

501
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,720
using a diagram which I find very

502
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,440
helpful.

503
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,159
So we can think about

504
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,960
you know our random process

505
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,679
as really taking some sort of path in a

506
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,600
tree. Maybe we start off our random

507
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,520
process

508
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,679
and then we have a whole bunch of

509
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,280
possibilities like B1, B2,

510
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,799
B3.

511
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:57,120
So what I'm deciding here is really

512
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,120
the answer to the question which of the

513
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,120
BIS

514
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,120
happens

515
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,559
right because in the setup of the law of

516
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,559
total probability all these BIS are

517
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,360
pair-wise disjoint and they cover the

518
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,600
space so you know when I start this

519
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,480
process before I actually tell you what

520
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,320
the outcome is where the dart lands I'm

521
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
first going to tell you which region the

522
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,559
dart lands in. Does it land in B1? Does

523
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,760
it land in B2? Does it land in B3? The

524
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
assumption that these things are

525
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,120
pairwise disjoint just means that one

526
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,880
and only one of these things happens.

527
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,039
But I have a different probability of

528
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,360
traversing these edges depending on what

529
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,640
the probability of those events are.

530
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,280
Right? And then finally

531
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,400
I can look at conditioned on B1

532
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,280
happening whether the event A actually

533
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,280
happens. Right? So I can continue this

534
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,280
process

535
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:01,520
and then what I can ask is you know how

536
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,640
does knowing that BI happens how does

537
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,640
that change

538
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,200
the probability

539
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,200
of A.

540
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,120
So this is a nice way to visualize it,

541
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,400
right? Because you know what's going on

542
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,880
in here [snorts]

543
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,960
is you can write it out instead using

544
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,880
conditional probability like another

545
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,080
equivalent way to do this is it's the

546
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,000
sum over i of the probability of a

547
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,039
conditioned on bi times the probability

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,960
of bi. Literally nothing is happening

549
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,600
here. I'm just using the definition of

550
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,679
what conditional probability is. And

551
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,320
then you can see that you know

552
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,039
algebraically what's happening is first

553
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,760
you're telling me which BI happened that

554
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,720
contributes this term right here. And

555
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,320
then once you tell me that BI happens I

556
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,400
have to also take into account the

557
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,559
remaining conditional probability. And

558
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,400
when I add up over all the possibilities

559
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,880
that gives me the total probability of

560
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,960
the event. So these are very basic

561
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,840
algebraic manipulations but they're

562
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,799
powerful.

563
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,799
So any questions?

564
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,400
All makes perfect sense.

565
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,279
>> So what is the what are the nodes?

566
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,440
>> Right? So this would be these are all of

567
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,919
the possible outcomes in the sample

568
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,760
space. So what I'm doing is instead of

569
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,720
just telling you first where the dart

570
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,120
lands like which X happens first. I'm

571
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,000
going to tell you whether B1 happens, B2

572
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,480
happens or B3 happens. Once I tell you

573
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,360
that B1 happens, I know my dart lands in

574
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,320
that space. I look at all the X's that

575
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,960
belong to B1. And maybe I just shade in

576
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,080
the X's that belong to that subset that

577
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,919
are also in my set A. So for example,

578
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,480
the fraction of nodes here that are

579
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,600
colored is exactly the probability of A

580
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,679
conditioned on B1. So you can see that I

581
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,919
have this probability of taking D1 and

582
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,840
then I have a conditional probability or

583
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,279
I have the probability of taking this

584
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,760
branch and then another conditional

585
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,679
probability. This is pictorially what

586
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,520
the law of probability is telling you.

587
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,880
You can think about it, you know, many

588
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,480
different ways. This is this is tricky.

589
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,039
So you know don't be uh embarrassed to

590
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,760
ask questions. That's why I'm here. Any

591
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,880
other questions?

592
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,600
Everyone thinks this is way too easy.

593
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,520
Way too hard.

594
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,720
Just right. Okay, I'll take it. All

595
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,039
right. Um,

596
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,039
let's see.

597
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,360
All right. Let's check our understanding

598
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,679
because some of these things are a

599
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,640
little bit counterintuitive.

600
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,520
Um,

601
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,440
how many people have heard of the Monty

602
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,480
Hall problem?

603
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,159
Okay. How many people

604
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,840
feel totally comfortable with the Monty

605
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,480
Hall problem and think I should skip it?

606
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,520
Or how many people want to hear it? Who

607
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,200
wants me to skip it?

608
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,679
Okay, that's a very small number, so I'm

609
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,400
going to do it. So, you've all seen the

610
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,200
Monty Hall problem before.

611
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,200
What I claim is that you know a lot of

612
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,799
these ways of thinking about things in

613
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,880
terms of the law of total probability in

614
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,799
terms of this visual I gave you here

615
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,080
well they give you a nice intuitive way

616
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,400
to think about what's going on. So you

617
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,279
know I'll give you maybe an explanation

618
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,120
you haven't seen before. So, remember in

619
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:38,240
the Monty Hall problem, there's a game

620
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,559
show and there's three doors

621
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,320
and behind one of the doors is a nice

622
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,720
prize.

623
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,640
Maybe there's a car,

624
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,520
but you don't know which door has the

625
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:55,400
prize. So, the way that the game works

626
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,400
is that first you pick a door.

627
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,080
Now, whatever door you pick, if I pick

628
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,640
this door, there's definitely another

629
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,240
door that doesn't have the prize. If I

630
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,159
pick this door that has the prize,

631
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,360
there's still another door that doesn't

632
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,360
have the prize. So either way, the host

633
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,279
can always,

634
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,440
no matter what you picked for your first

635
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:22,440
door, reveal to you another door that

636
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,440
you didn't select, which als

637
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,159
you shouldn't pick that door. And the

638
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,240
basic question is, you know, do you

639
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,559
switch?

640
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,559
So this is a very famous example. I

641
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,960
think the first time you see it, it is a

642
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,120
bit hard to wrap your head around, but

643
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,640
it's been done in virtually every class

644
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,159
that covers probability so often that um

645
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
you know, maybe it's become a little bit

646
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,360
more intuitive. Uh you know, as you all

647
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,360
know, the answer is that you switch that

648
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,080
then you'll win this game with twothirds

649
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,240
probability. Now, you can you know,

650
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,600
figure that out by computing conditional

651
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,360
probabilities. You have to be very

652
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,399
careful about the definitions of your

653
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,320
events. But I think a very intuitive way

654
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,640
to think about it is in terms of this

655
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,200
tree

656
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,960
that I drew before, right? Because we

657
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,600
can think about all the things that can

658
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,200
happen in the game. So in the beginning

659
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,520
when you choose a door, remember that

660
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,120
the prize is put behind a door at

661
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:25,120
random. So whatever door you choose, you

662
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,240
have a 23 probability of selecting a

663
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,039
door that has no prize.

664
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,240
and you have a one-thirds chance of

665
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,720
selecting the door that has the prize.

666
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,640
Of course, the game isn't over then. And

667
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,520
we can just think about what happens

668
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,120
depending on your choice of strategy.

669
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,159
You know, you could at that juncture

670
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,120
decide to switch, you could decide to

671
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:53,360
not switch. And the same thing happens

672
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,360
here. You could decide to switch or not

673
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,039
switch.

674
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,600
And the way to think about it is that,

675
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,320
you know, once I select the door that

676
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,559
doesn't have the prize, then the host

677
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,240
has no choice but to reveal to me the

678
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,559
only other door that doesn't have the

679
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,760
prize. And then when I switch, I

680
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,640
definitely win.

681
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,720
So I win as soon as I select a door in

682
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,520
the beginning with no prize if I'm

683
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,039
committed to the strategy switch. And if

684
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,279
I don't switch, then of course I lose.

685
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,200
And the same thing happens here, but you

686
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,120
know in reverse. If I got unlucky and I

687
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,440
selected the door with the prize and I

688
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,279
committed to the strategy switch, then

689
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,880
the host would show me one of these two

690
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,000
doors without the prize and I would

691
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,399
switch and I would lose my prize. But

692
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
this only happens with probability 1/3

693
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,720
because that's the probability that this

694
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,600
tree associates with it and otherwise

695
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,159
I'd win. So you can see that once I've

696
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,600
committed to the fact that I'm going to

697
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:58,240
switch all I need to do is I need to get

698
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,080
not super lucky just I need to select a

699
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,720
door which doesn't have the prize and

700
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,960
then automatically you can see that I

701
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,120
will win.

702
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,440
So we'll do more examples of these kinds

703
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,240
of things later especially in recitation

704
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,200
like drawing out these uh diagrams to

705
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,159
organize the state space. Let me tell

706
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,320
you one more really cool tool and then

707
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,679
we'll do some real world applications of

708
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:27,760
it. Uh this involves again conditional

709
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:32,120
probability. It's called Baze rule

710
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,120
and it's a very basic formula.

711
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,799
So imagine that we compute something

712
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,080
like the probability of B given A. It

713
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,720
turns out there's a way to express this

714
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,559
in terms of

715
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,360
the conditional probability the other

716
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:56,159
way around. You just have to correct by

717
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,720
the right factors of P of B and P of A.

718
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,039
So this is a very powerful rule. Uh the

719
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,399
proof is

720
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,960
quite straightforward. It's just

721
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,720
algebraic, right? Because all we have to

722
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
do is just invoke the definitions. So by

723
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,760
definition,

724
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,559
you know, how did we define the

725
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,559
probability of A given B? It was just

726
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:21,360
the probability of A and B

727
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,039
divided by the probability of B. Right?

728
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,799
That's literally what our definition

729
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,120
was. I can take this definition and I

730
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,799
can just multiply by this correction

731
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,159
term, which is probability of B over

732
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,559
probability of A. And if I do this on

733
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,240
both sides of my equation, well, one

734
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,360
side I'm going to get this right hand

735
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,960
side. So I'll get probability of A given

736
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,399
B times probability of B over the

737
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,559
probability of A.

738
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,720
And on my other side, the probability of

739
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,720
B's are going to cancel. I'm going to

740
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,519
get probability of A and B over

741
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,440
probability of A. And I claim that this

742
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,279
is the same thing as the probability of

743
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,600
B given A. And that's because it doesn't

744
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,919
matter what order I intersect these two

745
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,760
things. Probability of A and B is the

746
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,799
same thing as the probability of B and

747
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,760
A. And then this is again literally the

748
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,080
definition of conditional probability.

749
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,279
So the proof of this B rule is very

750
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,279
simple. In fact, um anyone know anything

751
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,640
historically about, you know, why people

752
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,559
were interested in this? So, it's kind

753
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,159
of interesting historical fact. Yeah,

754
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,720
>> they wanted to prove God.

755
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,279
>> Yeah, they wanted to prove God. Uh, the

756
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,720
existence of God using BA's rule. I

757
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,240
don't think they got there and we're not

758
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,320
going to get there today either, but

759
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
we'll still do some fun stuff with it.

760
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,480
It's kind of interesting. A lot of the

761
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,880
um, you know, foundations of probability

762
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,120
have some theological component to them,

763
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,760
but uh, I'll leave that as a discussion

764
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,840
for another time. So, we've got Baze

765
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,840
rule. Let's do a powerful real world

766
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,840
example.

767
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,760
The numbers in this example are all

768
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,079
completely real.

769
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,000
Okay. So, let me tell you some facts.

770
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,520
So approximately

771
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,040
1%

772
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,200
of women

773
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,679
aged

774
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,240
40 to 50

775
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,240
get breast cancer.

776
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,720
That is a shockingly high percentage,

777
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,560
but it's a true fact.

778
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,480
And one of the ways that you can try and

779
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,480
screen for breast cancer is a mammogram.

780
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,919
So a mamogram is not a perfect test. So

781
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,760
it has a 10%

782
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,440
false positive rate.

783
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,200
I'll tell you what I mean by that in a

784
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,839
second.

785
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,320
And it has similarly for its false

786
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,320
negative rate.

787
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,480
So let's look at two events which we

788
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,760
really care about, right? Because our

789
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,760
test is imperfect. We can look at A is

790
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,720
the event that we test positive,

791
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,200
right? And we can look at the event B

792
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,160
that we really have the condition that's

793
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,480
being tested for in this case, you know,

794
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,960
breast cancer.

795
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,440
These are the two events

796
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
and yeah

797
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,560
40.

798
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,800
>> Yeah, it is. Yeah. So developed in that

799
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,800
time frame.

800
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,240
So here just to be clear. So what do I

801
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:46,400
mean by the false positive rate? So this

802
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,680
would be the probability of a given not

803
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,400
b. So this is the chance the test says

804
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,079
positive even though you don't have it.

805
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,119
And we can also look at the false

806
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,800
negative rate which is the probability

807
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,960
of not a given b. So you actually do

808
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,680
have the condition but the test doesn't

809
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,920
pick it up. So both of these things a

810
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,720
lot of these tests you know we have much

811
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,800
higher accuracy tests but the idea is

812
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,040
that you know you usually deploy some

813
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,920
lower accuracy test as a screening

814
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,240
procedure right to try and get a rough

815
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,320
idea but then the question is you know

816
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,480
how much stock should you actually put

817
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,920
in the test results right so you know

818
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,640
one of the conditional probabilities

819
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,720
that's you know very important is what's

820
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,440
the probability of B given A right. So

821
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,119
what does this mean? You test positive

822
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,800
and then you're very worried but you

823
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,760
want to know whether you actually have

824
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,960
the condition or not. Right?

825
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,880
Um so this you know let me take a poll

826
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,880
from the audience.

827
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,520
Let's just say approximately what do you

828
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,079
think the probability of B given A is?

829
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,079
You know after all the mammogram has um

830
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,320
you know 10% false positive and false

831
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,640
negative rate. So maybe you think you've

832
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
got a 90% chance of having the

833
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,760
condition.

834
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,760
Maybe it's 75%.

835
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,079
Maybe it's 25%.

836
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:21,839
Maybe it's around 10%.

837
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,760
Maybe it's 1%.

838
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,560
So you all said you understand

839
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,119
conditional probability. You all said uh

840
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,520
you're ready for a test on it, right? So

841
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,760
here's my test. So what do you think the

842
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,240
answer is? Right? And this is a very

843
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,599
medically important question because um

844
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,680
you know when you test positive for

845
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,520
something you have many treatment

846
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,079
options. Some of them are more or less

847
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,240
invasive than others. So how sure are

848
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,720
you that you have that condition? Is it

849
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,720
worth it to do some very invasive and

850
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,880
risky procedure?

851
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,880
Uh so who thinks the answer is one 90%.

852
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:04,400
Who thinks the answer is two? 75%.

853
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,400
Three, 25%. You guys have to vote. Okay,

854
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,560
you can't abstain. You're a doctor.

855
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,119
Someone's relying on you. Let's try this

856
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,079
again. Who thinks the answer is one?

857
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,079
90%.

858
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,280
Just take a vote. Take a chance. Don't

859
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm not going to grade you on this.

860
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,320
Okay. Who thinks the answer is two? 75%.

861
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,560
Okay. Who thinks the answer's three,

862
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:34,160
25%. Who thinks the answer is four, 10%.

863
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:38,160
Who thinks the answer is five, 1%. Okay.

864
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,400
So, if you answered two,

865
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,560
then

866
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,960
that you're in good company because

867
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,040
that's the average physician's answer.

868
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,440
There was actually a survey of hundreds

869
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,640
of physicians and when you average their

870
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,240
scores, you get 75%. Unfortunately,

871
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,640
you're in a group that completely got

872
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,119
the wrong answer because the answer is

873
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,480
not at all 75%.

874
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,880
It's actually about 8%. So 10% is very

875
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,000
close. For anyone who answered four,

876
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,640
could you give me some kind of

877
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,440
intuition?

878
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,599
>> Yeah,

879
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,160
>> I guess 1% is like really low to begin

880
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,000
with. So 10xable.

881
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,400
>> Yeah, that's right. That's great

882
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,640
intuition is because if you think about

883
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,119
it already I mean this is a high

884
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,400
percentage but it's still in an absolute

885
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,400
sense low right so you can think that

886
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,560
the vast majority you know when you

887
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,240
think about a typical person who doesn't

888
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,320
have it 99% chance then there's still a

889
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,200
reasonable chance that they would still

890
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,119
test positive if they were tested and so

891
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,720
among the people who are tested positive

892
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,960
that's the region on the dart board I

893
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,480
care about still the disproport

894
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,960
proportionate share of them are people

895
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,040
who aren't going to have it. Right? So

896
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,760
this is actually uh from a very famous

897
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,839
book that I encourage you to read if you

898
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,480
want to be depressed.

899
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,800
Uh it's called thinking fast and slow by

900
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,560
conaman and it goes through all of these

901
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,400
examples about how people's and

902
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,880
especially doctors it kind of picks on

903
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,440
doctors uh make very counterintuitive

904
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,119
decisions. So you know when I used to

905
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,400
teach 042 more regularly I would still

906
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,160
do this example. I think it's a

907
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,280
beautiful example. And then in 2016, we

908
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,800
had our first kid uh baby girl. And I

909
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,480
remember that, you know, when we were

910
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,040
doing all these tests, not breast

911
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,599
cancer, but other things like testing

912
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,200
for the risk of Down syndrome, one of

913
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,440
the crazy things is that at the time,

914
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,280
what you do is you do an amnneoentesis

915
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,839
to do that. That's where you, you know,

916
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,240
put a needle into the belly and then you

917
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,079
extract fluid to try and figure out, uh,

918
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,079
whether, you know, various genetic

919
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,440
conditions are happening. The crazy

920
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,119
thing is that a lot of the things they

921
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,560
were testing for had very low

922
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,920
percentages of occurring. They're

923
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,680
terrible things when they happen like

924
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,760
Down syndrome, but the risk of causing

925
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,319
uh a miscarriage with am with an

926
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,200
amnocentesis when I looked it up was

927
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,200
something like one in 700. So I have to

928
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,920
say that like real world examples from

929
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,079
having kids makes these things feel very

930
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,599
differently. So if you're curious, I can

931
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,440
tell you all kinds of conditional

932
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,280
probabilities that doctors get wrong

933
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,400
that relate to child rearing, but that's

934
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,400
another topic for another time. Um, so

935
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,520
we have uh a little bit of time left.

936
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,280
What I'm going to do is I'm going to

937
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,280
start uh the next topic where we're

938
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,839
going to take these ideas even further.

939
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,200
So so far what we've talked about is

940
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,560
mostly events. We talked about ways to

941
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,640
reason about events. We talked about

942
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,400
what events were, how to combine them in

943
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,319
different ways. And we talked about

944
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
these fancy ways about reasoning about

945
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,960
their probability either through the law

946
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,440
of total probability or using

947
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,520
conditional probabilities. We talked

948
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,839
about how to reason about it through

949
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,839
this tree diagram I gave you. That's

950
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,560
sort of a way to organize the sample

951
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,319
space. We talked about some, you know,

952
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,720
the Monty Hall problem. We talked about

953
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,640
some real world examples.

954
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,800
Well, it turns out that um there's an

955
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,760
even more powerful abstraction that we

956
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,000
can do beyond events where things get

957
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,640
even more interesting. Some of the

958
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,839
theory goes over but it changes in in

959
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,200
cool ways. So let me explain this in

960
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,720
terms of you know how we're going to

961
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,480
generalize what we've seen right so last

962
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,240
topic for today I want to talk tell you

963
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,240
about is what are called random

964
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,240
variables.

965
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:36,720
Okay, so where are we right now? We

966
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:41,000
talked about events which are a subset

967
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,000
of the sample space.

968
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,599
We talked about a lot of properties of

969
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,160
events, right? We talked about the

970
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,000
property of independence

971
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,000
and how in some cases it can be

972
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,680
intuitive like when the experiments are

973
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,440
literally done separated from each

974
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,960
other. Other times it can be

975
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,680
counterintuitive and you just have to

976
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,960
check the definition. We talked about

977
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,400
you know conditioning.

978
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,760
We talked about unions and

979
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,560
intersections, right? And then you know

980
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,640
random variables instead of being a

981
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,599
subset of the sample space what they are

982
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,800
is they're functions

983
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,040
defined on the sample space.

984
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,920
So what they do is they take an outcome

985
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,119
and they ascribe to that outcome some

986
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,119
real value. Right? So this is the

987
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,119
intuitive thing. Let's do the

988
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,119
definition.

989
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,960
So a random variable

990
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,960
is a function

991
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,319
f that goes from my sample space and

992
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,640
ascribes to each outcome some real

993
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,480
value.

994
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,520
And in fact we'll be interested in a lot

995
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,319
of properties of random variables. So

996
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,880
one of the most useful and ubiquitous

997
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,520
properties is called its expectation. So

998
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,400
let's just define that now too. So the

999
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,400
associated expectation

1000
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,680
of the random variable

1001
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,760
as just literally the average over your

1002
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,400
probability space of the values the

1003
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,280
function takes. So I write it here. This

1004
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,240
is you know a little block E

1005
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,440
and it's defined to be equal to the sum

1006
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,760
over all outcomes in my space of the

1007
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:39,520
probability of that outcome times the

1008
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,319
real value of the corresponding random

1009
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,880
variable. So this is just a weighted

1010
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,720
average of the value of the random

1011
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,000
variable weighted by the probability of

1012
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,079
each one of these outcomes. Right? So,

1013
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,680
you know, random variables come up all

1014
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,240
the time. You know, we don't just care

1015
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,920
about events. Um, you know, one of the,

1016
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,079
you know, simplest ways that might come

1017
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,400
up is even in understanding something

1018
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,079
like betting, right? Where there are a

1019
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,680
lot of different outcomes that you could

1020
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,119
be betting on. And then, you know,

1021
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,800
something like the random variable would

1022
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,319
describe the payoffs, the different

1023
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,400
parties.

1024
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,400
So, let's do some simple examples to get

1025
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,800
some intuition for what the random

1026
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,800
variable is.

1027
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,119
Let's do one where the sample space is

1028
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,119
infinite just for fun.

1029
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,079
So let's toss a coin

1030
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,119
until

1031
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,760
you get

1032
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,760
a heads. We'll start off with a fair

1033
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,960
coin and then we'll we'll vary this

1034
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,920
experiment. Right? So you know first

1035
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,920
what is the sample space?

1036
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,760
Well, we could have the first coin as

1037
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,520
heads already and we stop there. We

1038
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,640
could have tails heads could have tails

1039
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,359
tails heads and so on. So any sequence

1040
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,520
of ta uh tails any length from zero to

1041
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,960
infinity with a heads appended at the

1042
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,640
end. That's our sample space. And we

1043
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,720
also care about what's the associated

1044
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,720
probability measure. So furthermore,

1045
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,720
the probability

1046
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:45,119
of having I T's and then one H is equal

1047
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,599
to a half to the I + one, right? Because

1048
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,520
I better get my first thing is a tails.

1049
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,920
That's a half probability. My second

1050
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,240
thing is a tails and so on. And there I

1051
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,960
+ one things here. So the chance of

1052
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,599
getting exactly this string is just half

1053
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,359
raised to the i + 1.

1054
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,240
And now we have enough information that

1055
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:07,200
we can compute the expected value. So

1056
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:12,760
let's look at the random variable we'll

1057
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,760
be interested in will be just the number

1058
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,400
of coin tosses.

1059
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,480
So of course this game in principle

1060
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,119
could go on forever but the expected

1061
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,359
value gives us some baseline of you know

1062
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,079
what we expect it to be. We're going to

1063
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:31,040
talk about a lot fancier tools later uh

1064
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,880
in a few lectures time because when we

1065
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,280
get back to random variables we're going

1066
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,079
to talk about tools for arguing why

1067
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,880
random variables in some cases are very

1068
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,240
close to their expectation. That's very

1069
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,720
important in things like you know

1070
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,640
understanding the error of polling. But

1071
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,960
for right now we just want to work with

1072
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,599
you know what a random variable is and

1073
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,880
get some crude idea of kind of what we

1074
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:57,119
expect it to be approximately.

1075
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,760
So you know the natural way to do this

1076
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,720
to compute the expectation of f is

1077
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,000
literally just to uh you know use the

1078
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,839
expression we gave you right. So you

1079
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,560
know there's a half probability that the

1080
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:13,200
game is over instantly.

1081
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,000
and uh you know that we get heads to

1082
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,240
begin with. There's a quarter

1083
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,640
probability

1084
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,440
that this game goes on for two total

1085
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,559
flips. There's an eighth probability

1086
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,440
that it goes on for

1087
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,839
three total flips and so on. And so we

1088
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,760
can write this as a series. It's the sum

1089
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:40,720
from k = 1 to infinity

1090
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:43,040
of k * 1 / 2 k.

1091
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,040
Uh already on the homework we've shown

1092
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,599
you some examples of you know how to

1093
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,280
evaluate sums like this. We're going to

1094
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,040
talk about this in a lot more detail

1095
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,359
when we get to the counting unit which

1096
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,800
is right after the probability unit. So

1097
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,640
we'll give you tools not only for

1098
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,440
evaluating these sums but for thinking

1099
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,000
about what kinds of things they count.

1100
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,880
But in any case, we can uh evaluate this

1101
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,359
very quickly just by um arranging things

1102
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,520
in the right way. So from this

1103
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,800
expression, it's not that easy to guess

1104
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,040
what the answer is. But if we break up,

1105
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,520
you know, this quarter, this 2 * a

1106
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,319
quarter into the sum of two quarters, it

1107
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,800
becomes a lot easier.

1108
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,040
So let's write it out pictorially. We

1109
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,000
have a half from the first term and then

1110
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:31,000
we have two quarters and then we have

1111
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
three

1112
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,640
and this thing goes on right and what we

1113
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,119
can do is we can evaluate this sum in a

1114
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,680
different way line by line row by row

1115
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,760
first. So if we have a half plus a

1116
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,559
quarter plus an eighth plus a 16th and

1117
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,720
so on. Well, this you probably all know

1118
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,440
the answer is one for what that part of

1119
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,559
the sum contributes. And if instead we

1120
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,119
have a quarter plus an eighth plus a 16,

1121
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,720
well, that's going to give us a half.

1122
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,040
And the next thing will give us a

1123
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,200
quarter. And now when we sum up all of

1124
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,200
these guys along the column, we're going

1125
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,599
to get two.

1126
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,839
So this is very natural. The expected

1127
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,960
number of flips for a coin until you get

1128
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,800
your first heads is two, right? Makes

1129
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,294
sense.

1130
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,294
Um [clears throat]

1131
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,880
and in fact we can do this in a more

1132
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,119
clever way too. We'll use this in a

1133
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,040
minute actually. So let me explain you

1134
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,480
know the even more general setting

1135
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,599
which leads me to something called

1136
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,200
meanantime to failure.

1137
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,000
This is something that comes up in a lot

1138
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,480
of computer science applications.

1139
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,079
Let me give you the story behind it, but

1140
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,559
it'll really be the same kind of

1141
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,920
exercise we just did.

1142
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:54,480
Imagine we've got some computer

1143
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,920
as a part of some giant uh computing

1144
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:01,920
system and it's not a perfect computer

1145
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:05,480
and it fails independently

1146
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,480
on each day

1147
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:12,359
with some probability P.

1148
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,119
Well, one of the things you might be

1149
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,000
interested in, what's called the

1150
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,000
meanantime to failure,

1151
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,520
is how many days you expect the computer

1152
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,280
to last before you replace it. Right?

1153
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,920
This is a very basic probabistic

1154
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,839
statement. that shows up all the time uh

1155
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,839
especially in things like actuarial

1156
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:40,079
sciences or you know literally in

1157
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,640
computing because you know when you're

1158
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:45,520
building giant um you know computing

1159
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,599
systems like chat GPT you know you have

1160
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,079
to create this huge infrastructure of

1161
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,240
computers and they often fail and you

1162
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,079
have to have some idea for how often

1163
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,800
that's going to happen and how much the

1164
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,559
cost is to replace these parts to figure

1165
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,200
out economically what you're sinking

1166
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,200
into the system. But you know we can do

1167
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,800
the same exercise we did the same way.

1168
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,240
I'll do it in a slightly more clever

1169
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,800
way. So we have this random variable t

1170
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,680
that is the time that this computer

1171
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,920
fails. Right? So we have some

1172
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,880
probability p that it happens on the

1173
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,920
first day. And then we have some

1174
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,319
probability 1 minus p * p that it

1175
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,400
happens on the second day. Let's just do

1176
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:30,880
out one more. 1 - p^ 2 * p and it

1177
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,960
happens on the third day.

1178
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,640
But there's a clever trick for doing

1179
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,680
this which is that this is equal to p

1180
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:46,480
you know from this first term times 1

1181
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:49,200
minus p * 1 + the expectation of t. So

1182
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,440
this looks a bit magical right? Can

1183
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:56,000
anyone give me some intuition for what

1184
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,000
exactly I just did in this expression?

1185
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,760
Why is this true? Yeah,

1186
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,680
that's right. That's right. So, first,

1187
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,440
you know, I got my P from here. I pulled

1188
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,359
out this one minus P because

1189
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,359
everything's got a one minus P in front

1190
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,640
of it. But then the important thing is

1191
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:19,760
that, you know, when I don't fail on the

1192
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,480
first day, the entire process starts

1193
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,880
over again, right? It has no memory of

1194
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,920
what happened in the past. I've gone one

1195
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,319
extra day, but then whatever happens to

1196
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,480
that same identical random variable that

1197
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,680
I care about is going to be what happens

1198
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,359
the process there on out. Right? So in

1199
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,960
fact, this makes it much easier. Instead

1200
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,960
of messing around with these infinite

1201
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,559
sums, I can just rearrange things

1202
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,240
algebraically.

1203
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:51,480
And what I'll get is that the

1204
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:51,480
expectation of t is equal to 1 over p.

1205
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:58,960
Okay, any questions?

1206
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,880
Make sense? All right, so the meanantime

1207
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,240
to failure just depends on this failure

1208
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,240
probability in this very simple way.

1209
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,280
So let's uh get back to expectation and

1210
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,960
then I'm going to tell you something

1211
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,160
unlike the Monty Hall problem that

1212
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,240
you're definitely going to find

1213
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,880
counterintuitive.

1214
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,520
So, we talked about random variables. We

1215
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,520
talked about events.

1216
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:31,160
Actually, there's a way to go back and

1217
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,160
forth between the two.

1218
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,520
So, it turns out that we can actually

1219
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:45,880
treat events

1220
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,880
as random variables.

1221
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,920
This will be a very important trick that

1222
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,240
we're going to use all the time.

1223
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,000
So this is called the indicator

1224
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,480
function.

1225
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,480
So in particular,

1226
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,040
if you give me an event A,

1227
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,359
well, I can define this function that

1228
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,079
has this funny notation. Usually you

1229
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,720
write it as a bold-faced one with an a

1230
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,599
subscript, but this is just a random

1231
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,800
variable. It takes in some outcome from

1232
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,319
the sample space and it spits out a real

1233
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,160
value.

1234
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:35,040
It spits out the value one if

1235
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,319
your event belong if your outcome

1236
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:43,280
belongs to the event. Fine. And it

1237
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:45,599
outputs a zero otherwise. Okay.

1238
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,000
So in particular this is you know if you

1239
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,680
give me an event this describes an

1240
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,160
associated random variable. So this is

1241
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,240
just a recipe for it. My random variable

1242
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,040
takes on real values actually takes on

1243
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,720
values just one or zero. It's one if the

1244
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,960
event is on, it's zero otherwise.

1245
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,000
And now the good thing is that um a lot

1246
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,640
of what we do with uh you know random

1247
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,960
variables we can use to reason about

1248
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:14,000
events. So let's connect this back to

1249
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:19,359
events. So I can look at for example the

1250
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,079
expectation of my indicator function

1251
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,920
over a random outcome. So let's just be

1252
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,119
clear because we've introduced a lot of

1253
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,280
notation already today for probability.

1254
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,520
Remember that when I write this bold E,

1255
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,079
I'm looking at that experiment where I

1256
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:38,400
throw my dart and I get some outcome in

1257
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:40,640
my space that tells me what X I have.

1258
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,599
And remember that you know an event is

1259
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,599
just whether or not X belongs to A. But

1260
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,200
what's going on here is that I have this

1261
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:52,240
function that just outputs one if X

1262
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,160
belongs to A and outputs zero otherwise.

1263
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,880
So in this case we can write out what

1264
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,079
the definition of the expectation is.

1265
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:03,040
It's the sum over all outcomes in my uh

1266
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:08,200
set of the probability of the outcome

1267
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,200
times the value of the random variable.

1268
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:16,000
And this is the same thing as the sum

1269
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:18,480
over all x in a of the probability of x,

1270
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,760
right? Because the only way that this

1271
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,839
term survives is if x belongs to a.

1272
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,240
Otherwise, the term is zero and it goes

1273
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:28,559
away. So this is really just bookkeeping

1274
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,280
for keeping track of which p of x's

1275
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,280
contribute to my sum. And this way I

1276
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,000
change the subscript of my sum from

1277
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:39,119
being over all outcomes to only the

1278
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,520
outcomes in my set. So in particular the

1279
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:44,319
nice thing is that we get back the

1280
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,799
probability of the event. So you can see

1281
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:49,040
that we can use random variables as a

1282
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:51,280
placeholder for computing things like

1283
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,680
the probabilities of events just by

1284
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,520
looking at their expectation.

1285
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,559
So this is just a bunch of bookkeeping.

1286
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:01,440
Does this make sense? Any questions? All

1287
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:04,160
right.

1288
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:07,920
So now um one of the really powerful

1289
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,880
things about expectation is that it

1290
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,040
behaves really nicely in some settings.

1291
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,520
It uh behaves as nicely as you could

1292
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,119
want. So let me tell you a powerful

1293
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,760
fact. Uh some of you have probably

1294
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,839
already seen it before, but linearity of

1295
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,655
expectation.

1296
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:25,655
So it turns out [clears throat]

1297
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:37,720
that when you add random variables,

1298
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,720
computing their expectation is easy.

1299
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,680
So in particular, I can look at a random

1300
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:53,599
variable f ofx. I can look at a random

1301
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,520
variable g of x, right? And what I'm

1302
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,160
doing when I add them is I'm literally

1303
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,920
creating a new random variable, right?

1304
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,559
Because my random variable is just going

1305
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,640
to be h of x that adds up the two values

1306
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,880
of this function. This right here is

1307
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,599
still a function from all of my outcomes

1308
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,880
to a real value. And when I look at its

1309
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,680
expectation, that's the same thing as

1310
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:19,160
the sum of the expectations of the

1311
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,160
individual functions.

1312
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,799
So, this is a powerful tool. I think the

1313
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,960
first time you see it, it's easy to like

1314
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:32,079
nod your head and and think it looks

1315
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,079
obvious. Uh, let's prove it, but then

1316
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:37,520
I'll test your intuition to see how well

1317
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:41,200
you understand this.

1318
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,839
So, all we have to do is follow our nose

1319
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,079
and use the definition.

1320
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:49,760
We can look at this left hand side the

1321
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:53,040
expectation of f ofx plus g ofx

1322
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:57,599
right and by definition this is the sum

1323
00:59:53,040 --> 01:00:01,119
over all x in my sample space of p of x

1324
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:05,680
times the value of the random variable

1325
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,839
which is f ofx plus g ofx right and now

1326
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,480
I can just multiply through and and

1327
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:13,680
separate out the sum and this is the

1328
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:19,440
same thing as the sum over all x and

1329
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:24,880
of P of X * FX plus the sum over all X

1330
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:27,520
and S of P of X * G ofX. And now we're

1331
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,880
in good shape because this term right

1332
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:33,839
here is literally our definition of the

1333
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,559
expectation of F. This term right here

1334
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:39,520
is literally our definition of the

1335
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,920
expectation of G. So that proves what we

1336
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,640
wanted, right? A lot of other things do

1337
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,839
not behave this nicely, but expectations

1338
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:51,520
always add no matter how complicated the

1339
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:53,440
dependence is between f and g.

1340
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,760
So let me test your intuition to make

1341
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:59,640
sure that people are following this. I

1342
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,640
guess I'll erase that part.

1343
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:23,720
Okay,

1344
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,720
so we know that if we have some event

1345
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:30,319
A, we can look at the associated random

1346
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:34,079
variable, the corresponding indicator of

1347
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:37,440
that event 1 A. Can look at some other

1348
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,839
event, you know, 1B.

1349
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,680
And we already know from before that the

1350
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:44,799
expectation

1351
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:49,599
of this indicator

1352
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:51,599
of a is equal to the probability of a.

1353
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:56,160
Right?

1354
01:01:51,599 --> 01:02:01,520
Um what if I look at the expectation of

1355
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:03,520
1 a of x plus 1 b of x

1356
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,839
in some sense this looks like you know

1357
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:09,520
I'm taking into account whether a or b

1358
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:12,720
happened is this equal to for example

1359
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,040
the probability that event a or b

1360
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,160
happens

1361
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,160
just to test your intuition.

1362
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,640
All right. So, how many people think the

1363
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,640
answer is yes?

1364
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:37,760
How many people think the answer is no?

1365
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,520
Okay. So, the nos have it. So, someone

1366
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,440
who said no, can you tell me what's

1367
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,440
wrong? I mean, it seems intuitive, but

1368
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,280
it's not true.

1369
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,559
>> Yeah.

1370
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,319
A and B both happen that it gets double

1371
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,720
counted on the left side but not on the

1372
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,280
right.

1373
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,359
>> That's right. That's right. So you know

1374
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,920
what's going on here, right? Is we can

1375
01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:02,960
go back to our diagram. We have these

1376
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:05,119
two events A and B, right?

1377
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,640
And when I look at the expectation of,

1378
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:10,480
you know, one A of X, well, I'm just

1379
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,480
looking at this dart and throwing it in

1380
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,480
here. And every time it lands inside A,

1381
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,799
I'm getting a dollar. every time it

1382
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,400
lands outside, I'm getting no dollars.

1383
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,039
And I'm looking at the expected number

1384
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,960
of dollars I win, right? And that's the

1385
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,920
same thing as the probability that the

1386
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,400
dart actually lands in that set, right?

1387
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,720
And now, same thing is true for B. But

1388
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,880
when I add these two things up, what's

1389
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,880
going on is if I actually landed in the

1390
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,839
intersection of these two, I'd be

1391
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:41,039
getting $2, right? So really what's

1392
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:43,520
going on is that this is not equal

1393
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,000
because this is no longer an indicator

1394
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,640
random variable. It doesn't just take

1395
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,200
the value zero and one. It also takes

1396
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,960
the value two sometimes. The only way

1397
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,760
this would be true is if a and b were

1398
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:58,079
actually disjoint.

1399
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,680
All right. Does that make sense? All

1400
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,359
right.

1401
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:05,760
Sounds good. Um

1402
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:10,160
so I'll tell you

1403
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:13,440
uh one really interesting problem and

1404
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:16,319
then we'll end there and we'll go on to

1405
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,200
other topics next time.

1406
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:24,119
So you all have seen the Monty Hall

1407
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,119
problem before. That's no surprise.

1408
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:29,200
It turns out that uh you know

1409
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,680
conditional probability, conditional

1410
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,359
expectations can still be very you know

1411
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,480
counterintuitive

1412
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:38,240
in ways that even math professors can be

1413
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,160
totally wrong and have the wrong

1414
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,880
intuition.

1415
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,079
So let me tell you about uh this amazing

1416
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,079
example that's due to my colleague

1417
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,960
upstairs.

1418
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:55,520
Uh in fact I saw him right before class.

1419
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:57,680
It's called muscles dice paradox.

1420
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,000
Elenon Muscle is a very famous

1421
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,480
probabilist and um you know when he came

1422
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,160
up with this his adviser told him I know

1423
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,640
you've done a lot of great research and

1424
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,880
he proved amazing things but this will

1425
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,359
be what you're famous for and he was

1426
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,000
very disappointed.

1427
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:16,960
Um so here's the experiment.

1428
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,559
You can throw a dice

1429
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,920
until

1430
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,920
you get a six.

1431
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,240
Okay. And we're going to be interested

1432
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:30,559
in the number of roles that you have to

1433
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,240
take in expectation. Now, if that were

1434
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,520
it, there would be no paradox. We

1435
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,799
already talked about that for the

1436
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:39,599
meanantime to failure, right? Because if

1437
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:42,079
um my probability of rolling a six is

1438
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:44,079
six, I can look at the expected number

1439
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:47,119
of rolls and that would just be six.

1440
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,480
Fine. Right? So, nothing is hard here.

1441
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,760
But the experiment is you're going to

1442
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:54,160
throw a dice until you get a six.

1443
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,400
But now we want to compute the

1444
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,640
conditional expectation.

1445
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:03,359
So conditioned

1446
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:06,760
on all the throws

1447
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,760
being even

1448
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:14,880
like what if I tell you that all the

1449
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:18,359
throws are even. What is

1450
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,359
the expected

1451
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,119
number of rolls?

1452
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,039
So, very simple problem. Takes a little

1453
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,640
bit to wrap your head around it, right?

1454
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,160
But you know the way that this

1455
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,960
experiment goes, I'm sitting here

1456
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,160
throwing the die until I get a six. And

1457
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,559
you're not watching me do the

1458
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,079
experiment. But then before I ask you

1459
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,160
anything about the experiment, I tell

1460
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,079
you actually while I was doing it, I

1461
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,960
only got evens. It was the darnest

1462
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,280
thing. And now telling you that I only

1463
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,640
got even throws, I'm asking you how that

1464
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:55,440
changes your expected number of rolls.

1465
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,240
So it turns out that um you know there's

1466
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:01,280
a very natural way to try and answer

1467
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,920
this question. And almost everyone who

1468
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,960
sees this the first time gets it wrong

1469
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:09,359
the same way. It's it's amazing.

1470
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,720
So there's uh one argument that leads

1471
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:15,200
you to the wrong answer. So you'd claim

1472
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,760
you'd think

1473
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,760
that the answer

1474
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,799
is three.

1475
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:25,280
Let me tell you why you might think

1476
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:30,799
that. Right? So let's go through what we

1477
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:33,839
know. So we know that all roles are two,

1478
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:35,839
four or six, right? because you just

1479
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,280
promised me that all the rolls were

1480
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,880
even. So those are the only

1481
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,200
possibilities. Nothing else shows up

1482
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,960
when I roll the die.

1483
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,799
And now you know if you're rolling a

1484
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,359
dieice and it's only got three sides,

1485
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:49,680
you know, two, four, and six, then how

1486
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:51,359
long do you have to go until you end up

1487
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,920
with your first six and stop the

1488
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:56,960
experiment? Well, six is a third of the

1489
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:59,599
possibilities. So you'd expect just by

1490
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:03,359
this argument from this meanantime to

1491
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:05,200
failure that maybe the expected number

1492
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:09,680
of rolls

1493
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:11,920
is one over a third. So namely three

1494
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,160
and this is actually completely wrong.

1495
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,920
So in fact uh Elanon was teaching over

1496
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,880
at Berkeley when he came up with this

1497
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,199
example and uh he was doing a review for

1498
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,960
some probability class and he wanted to

1499
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,719
make this argument that you know

1500
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,560
probability is very counterintuitive and

1501
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:29,359
you just have to compute the darn you

1502
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,279
know algebraic expression to do it and

1503
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,120
he came up with this random example.

1504
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:35,279
There's no special intuition behind it.

1505
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,679
He came up with it on the fly and then

1506
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,159
he started doing the proof out and he

1507
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,719
got the answer three halves and he was

1508
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:45,199
so convinced that somewhere in there was

1509
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,279
like some algebraic mistake he'd made on

1510
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:48,960
the board. See the truth is when you're

1511
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,520
speaking to a large audience, you know,

1512
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,880
your your IQ decreases by 20 points at

1513
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,640
least. And um he told them that don't

1514
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,560
worry, you know, I'll tell you what's

1515
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,319
wrong with my computation and I'll email

1516
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,839
the class and I'll tell you what I got

1517
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,000
wrong so that you're ready for your

1518
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:07,440
exam. Hey, he went home and he checked

1519
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,279
it and um you know the darnest thing the

1520
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,759
answer is actually three halves. It's a

1521
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,920
very counterintuitive problem. In fact,

1522
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,600
I remember I'll tell you I guess this is

1523
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,719
videotaped. I'm not sure how much I

1524
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,400
should say. Um but you know we have a

1525
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,080
mailing list among some of the theory

1526
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,960
faculty especially ones who teach some

1527
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,279
of the intro uh you know proofbased math

1528
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,040
classes. And then when this thing came

1529
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,880
out, you know, David Carer emailed me

1530
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,199
and told me, "This would be a great

1531
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,839
example for, you know, 042. We should do

1532
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:38,080
this." And one faculty member who shall

1533
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:40,480
not be named was on the mailing list and

1534
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,400
did not believe the answer. It was the

1535
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,960
craziest thing. He was arguing with us

1536
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,719
back and forth on this thread I have and

1537
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,880
he just was convinced that the answer

1538
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,640
was three.

1539
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,199
And uh actually, should I cut the video

1540
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,880
for this? Okay. So, let me tell you uh

1541
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:57,760
the other part of the story. So then he

1542
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,440
went on this debate for like uh maybe a

1543
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,280
month or two not believing the answers

1544
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,840
we gave him even about this very basic

1545
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,440
statement and then he finally came into

1546
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,320
our theory faculty lunch which I have to

1547
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,920
go to after this and he said aha I

1548
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,239
understand what was wrong you were all

1549
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,560
explaining it wrong let me tell you my

1550
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:17,199
explanation so he started explaining it

1551
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:19,440
in this very convoluted way and Peter

1552
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:21,760
was there with me at lunch uh Peter was

1553
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,080
co-eing and Peter usually doesn't say

1554
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,679
that much in the faculty lunches and he

1555
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,073
Now I know why no one understands

1556
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,880
probability when you teach it,

1557
01:10:28,073 --> 01:10:30,800
[laughter]

1558
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,320
which is kind of amazing. So I'll uh

1559
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,280
scrub the rest of the names from the

1560
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,120
story. But um we'll do some examples in

1561
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:40,800
class where we actually ask you to

1562
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,320
compute this and uh you know you'll see

1563
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,760
you know some tricks for doing this and

1564
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,600
it'll be a good exercise for some of

1565
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,679
your writing problems. So we'll stop

1566
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,520
there a bit early and next time we will

1567
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:53,560
continue with inclusion, exclusion and

1568
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,560
other applications in probability.
