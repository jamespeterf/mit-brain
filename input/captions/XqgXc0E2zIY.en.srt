1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,319
Yes, there's a

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:12,840

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:17,400
one-part solution that uses a quantum buffer. I'm going to have to do a quantum computing experiment

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:24,320

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,320
and then I

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
'm going to have a

7
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:36,640
new kind of computer that harnesses the

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,440
power of quantum computing to perform tasks much faster than

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,879
normal classical digital

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,559
computers. In 2019, in an experiment, we used

11
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,000
mathematical prowess. The world took the best

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,320
supercomputer in the world 10,000 years to solve the

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,120
problem on the quantum computer in under

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,039
minutes. This is how some improvements in

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,239
classical algorithms have factored down,

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,200
but essentially, that sort of experimental

17
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,439
improvement still exists, and it increases.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,560
The factor increases with the size of the problem. Another

19
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,159
important problem, if

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,000
you all have heard of quantum computing, is

21
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,079
a factoring algorithm which underpins all of

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,200
the encryption. We know  Today, so at least given a large

23
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,640
amount of large enough quantum

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,840
computers, you could break encryption in under

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,320
a day. That would take normal classical compute

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,360
millions, if not billions of years. Let's say

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,680
you get sold on quantum computers and you can

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,479
try them out. So this is what the experience

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,960
looks like. You have to deal with lots of messy

30
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,640
classical computing tasks. You have to

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,600
set up the environment and manage all the access to

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,200
cloud-hosted quantum computers. Deal

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,439
with different architectures of quantum computers and

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,560
their couplers and simulators. It's a

35
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,680
messy thing that you have to learn about

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,600
quantum computers. You have to deal with

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,600
problems as well. And we're saying that we are a

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,200
cloud-hosted one-stop platform

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,200
that provides you with the easiest access. I'd love to

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,679
pitch it. We'll take you from not knowing much about

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,000
quantum computers to writing your

42
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,400
first quantum program to running it on

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,319
a real quantum computer in under 5

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,319
minutes and it's done.  This is many times and this

45
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,120
is the entire region where so many different companies

46
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,000
are starting to partner with us we

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,200
partner very close with IBM nvia and many

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,280

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,840

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,280
times their hardware is available as well we cant help but

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,159

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,640
expand our partnerships with many more

53
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,040
companies so in order to serve our end user

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,840
customers better and we also support gpu and

55
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,680
cpu so all your compute needs in one

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,480
place you can just buy some credits

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,000
and decide to spend them on gpu and cpu ultimately we

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,000
believe the architecture for

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,879
compute will be a hybrid one it will solve part

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,040
of your problem on some compute

61
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,959
part on gpu and cpu and we are the

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,840
best places to serve that model and let's say you have a

63
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,120
place to get started with all kinds

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,920
of applications you might be looking for  There are a

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,319
whole bunch of applications that people are

66
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,239
starting to explore with applications in

67
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,400
pharmaceutical materials science, aerospace, and so on.

68
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,360
With pharmaceutical materials science, the

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,040
real improvement is expected with

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,200
higher confidence in other industries.

71
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,480
People are still exploring how to use

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,959
quantum computers. One of the areas that we're really

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,480
focusing on is protein-

74
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,159
drug interactions. How do you go from protein

75
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,319
and drug molecules to solving this problem

76
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:52,159
on a quantum computer? And this is where we have a

77
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,840
protein coming from an Alzheimer's drug, something called

78
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,720
beta-lide, and understanding its

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,360
interaction with a metal ion that leads to the

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,159
disease and plaques in the brain that can solve

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,000
signs of the disease. And so this is a

82
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:12,560
project with the University of Chicago's Envia, Argonne

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,280
National Lab, and we're building this really cool

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,799
pipeline that takes advantage of state-of-

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,720
the-art algorithms being  I'm glad to see you at the moment

86
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,280
bringing them together and allowing you to

87
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,759
run on a quantum computer. This is in active

88
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,840
development and we have things being tested

89
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,840
on APC and quantum computers.

90
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
We work with various scale holders with

91
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,600
enterprises for your use cases. We are one

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,639
of the largest. We have one of the

93
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,680
largest user bases in the community and

94
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,600
by the fact that they are super easy to use. We are

95
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,919
incredibly popular with users. We have one of

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,320
the largest user bases. We are incredibly popular at the same time. We

97
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,720
support more than every year and with

98
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,720
quantum computing companies, we allow them to

99
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,960
launch their software and hardware on

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:15,080
Qube. We are looking for other

101
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,720
test companies for using our Qube

102
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,800
pipeline for protein and drug simulation. We are also

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,880
happy to work with you to

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,450
provide access to the Qube platform.

105
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,600
Thank you very much

106
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,600
[appreciation]
