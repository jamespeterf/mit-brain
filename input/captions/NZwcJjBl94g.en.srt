husband Henry Tamir who for many was an

33
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,680
inspirational leader our goal is to

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,280
connect life science innovators biotech

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,320
entrepreneurs CEOs and Visionaries

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
because we believe that helping leaders

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,840
succeed will ultimately help their

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,600
Innovations reach patients we believe in

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,759
the work of everyone in this room and

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,600
are honored to play a role in amplifying

41
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,759
the voices of rare disease researchers

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,799
discoverers and CEOs we recognize how

43
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,079
important it is to Foster community and

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,000
collaboration in this space days like

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,840
today remind us to pause and come

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,960
together with that we are inviting

everyone to join us in Partnership skill

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,920
and knowledge sharing towards driving

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,280
impact and change in the lives of rare

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,560
disease patients and families again

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,560
thank you for joining

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,000

also uh Katy liori um and others I'm

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,200
sure on the termier foundation side who

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,040
I haven't mentioned are uh very much uh

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,080
the people behind this event today so I

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,599
want to make sure that we don't forget

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,920
uh sometimes it happens until the end

64
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,680
but to acknowledge them at the beginning

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,280
and say a great thank you for bringing

66
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,519
us all together today uh for this

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,080
special event so um my name is Anna grea

68
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
I am a professor at Harvard Medical

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,599
School I am an uh a Core Institute

70
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,799
member here at the broad Institute and I

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,920
have really dedicated uh my scientific

72
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,360
uh career to understanding uh rare

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,640
diseases and hopefully building

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,280
therapies uh for rare diseases and it is

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,560
um actually our 10th anniversary today

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,440
uh the 10th event that is being

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
organized here at Broad which really

78
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,720
coincides with you know a conversation I

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,680
had about 10 years ago or 10 and a half

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,439
years ago now with um the founding

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,000
director of the broad Eric Lander and

82
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,280
then subsequently with the current dor

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,120
of the Bro Todd Gob in both cases I sort

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,680
of made the case for how can the world's

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,920
or one of the world's Premier uh

86
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,640
genetics and genomics Institute not have

87
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,480
a special day for rare diseases and of

88
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,319
course in the typical entrepreneurial

89
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,360
Spirit of the broad they said well why

90
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,560
don't you start one and so here we are

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,879
10 years later uh celebrating uh the

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,680
10th anniversary of this uh day of

93
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,840
coming together to um talk about rare

94
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,959
diseases to meet with all the

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,280
stakeholders in this uh broad Community

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,640
it's the uh

97
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,439
the scientists the families the patients

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,519
uh the Physicians everyone is welcome

99
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,680
under this big um tent uh and it really

100
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,280
um in in many ways affects all of us in

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,879
different parts um of Our Lives as you

102
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,199
know of course uh rare diseases uh there

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,040
are you know about 10,000 rare diseases

104
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,320
they disproportionately affect children

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
of course um and it is you know a big

106
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,960
fight to try to understand them and

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,199
develop therapies for as many of these

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,639
diseases as quickly as possible and many

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,000
of you and many of the people will hear

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,880
from today are very very much engaged um

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,360
in this fight and you know of course one

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,240
has to acknowledge uh at an event like

113
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,800
this that there are some headwinds that

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,919
you know we're all facing at this time

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,800
um I think it's uh important to uh

116
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,160
mention that you know there have been um

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,840
you know uh there was a lot of Hope for

118
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,800
the renewal of the priority voucher

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,080
review program for example which many of

120
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,080
our colleagues in biotech and Fara would

121
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,880
have relied on in order to make

122
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,919
investments and make progress in this

123
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,560
space and you know this is uh something

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,840
that did not happen um uh in December

125
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,600
and so it's something that we now hope

126
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,160
uh will become part of the conversation

127
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,280
again um and of course we all uh you

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,199
know wish to advocate for that program

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,639
to be uh reinstituted so that it can

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,759
help our patients especially our

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,800
pediatric patients uh with rare diseases

132
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,880
and I think this generally compounds an

133
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,600
overall landscape that one again has to

134
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,400
acknowledge in biotech and Pharma where

135
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,800
there has been some uh reluctance in

136
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,160
making investments in this space and

137
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,720
again I think that we all um you know uh

138
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,039
understand this and we all feel it in

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
different aspects of our lives but as

140
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,319
everyone who knows me knows I am an

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,880
optimist and a a glass half full type of

142
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,199
person and so I couldn't be more excited

143
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,479
about what this next uh decade will

144
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,840
bring in terms of our abilities to

145
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,720
address uh rare diseases uh especially

146
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,759
an area that our group here at Broad is

147
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,560
very much interested in rare genetic

148
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,639
diseases um we have launched um an

149
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,479
initiative um that is really focused um

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,240
on making progress uh in this space we

151
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,240
call it the ladder secures accelerator

152
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,919
some of you may have been to uh our

153
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,800
symposia we have another one coming up

154
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,240
in May which you're all absolutely

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,479
invited to attend um but the whole

156
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,479
concept of the ladder secures

157
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,039
accelerator is to actually uh in simple

158
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,639
terms uh try to harness what we

159
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,960
understand about the biology of rare

160
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,599
diseases uh in a massively parallel

161
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,360
fashion so that we can find nodes

162
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,000
targetable nodes that underly many uh

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,160
diseases so that we can potentially

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,160
develop treatments for as many of these

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,400
diseases as possible the orphan as many

166
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,280
diseases as possible and so you will

167
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,759
hear today from uh some of the speakers

168
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,479
who are involved in the latter secures

169
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,080
accelerator because they have you know

170
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,360
received support uh from uh from our

171
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,639
accelerator to uh push some of the what

172
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,120
we call nodal biology projects forward

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,800
and you know you you'll hear about

174
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,319
progress that's happening in that space

175
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,960
you will hear more of that at our annual

176
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,639
Symposium which is happening in May um

177
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,879
but there's also some deep verticals

178
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,960
that we're fighting for uh as part of

179
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,199
this uh uh this project this accelerator

180
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,520
which basically means that we're going

181
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,080
deep into understanding uh noal biology

182
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,160
here at Broad by really uh attacking

183
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,639
simultaneously thousands of rare genetic

184
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,160
diseases modeled in um human cells in

185
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,919
parallel and interrogating them with

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,520
modern tools like crisper Technologies

187
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,319
and uh AI driven Imaging approaches that

188
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,639
allow us uh to actually understand about

189
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:28,160
the underlying biology of thousands of

190
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,440
misspellings in the DNA in a massively

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
parallel simultaneous fashion

192
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,479
and no one uh could be a better speaker

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
to represent some of those efforts that

194
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,039
are happening here at Broad than our

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,479
keynote speaker for today Dr Anne

196
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,080
Carpenter who is of course my colleague

197
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,960
uh my friend she's an Institute

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,759
scientist here at the broad and she's

199
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,120
really a Pioneer in you know what you

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,960
hear now more and more like Aid driven

201
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,800
image processing and understanding

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,720
images well Anne was doing it way before

203
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,680
this was actually cool or a buzzword

204
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,919
that everyone used all over the all over

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,360
the world and I think you will hear

206
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,280
something about about all these

207
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,319
foundational discoveries that she made

208
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,479
possible which now make it possible for

209
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
us to potentially understand thousands

210
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,240
of um rare genetic diseases in a

211
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,840
massively parallel fashion so without uh

212
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,479
further Ado I will let um an uh take it

213
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,000
from here thank you so much for coming

214
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,000
thank you so

215
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,680
much I'm so proud to be part of this

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,599
celebration today of how far the

217
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,520
community of rare disease research has

218
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,599
come and also um pushing towards what's

219
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,000
in the future so really excited to be

220
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,959
part of this event today thanks for

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,839
organizing thank you Belinda as well um

222
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,039
I want to begin with just this visual

223
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,039
that you may have seen before of all the

224
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,200
individual genome regions associated

225
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,760
with disease that have been discovered

226
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,279
you know back when I started my career

227
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,959
there weren't so many um and now it's

228
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,440
just exploded this doesn't even come up

229
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:55,040
to present day and what this chart tells

230
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,560
me is that while of course it's

231
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,600
wonderful if we could assign a a team of

232
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,360
a thousand researchers to each disorder

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,079
out there it's just not going to be

234
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,760
scalable even to keep up with the new

235
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,839
diseases that are discovered every day

236
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,040
through genome sequencing much less to

237
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,120
get to this backlog so we need something

238
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,800
more systematic and of course we always

239
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,839
think well technology should help us

240
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,120
here right and there are some amazing

241
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,880
technologies that have come into play

242
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
Computing is one that I'm very excited

243
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,279
about as a machine learning and

244
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,519
computational biology expert um you

245
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,000
might be familiar with this view Mo's

246
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,640
law which is showing on a log scale this

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,920
sort of exponential decrease in the cost

248
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:38,279
of compute over time and it's just a

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,560
phenomenal um you know um peak of human

250
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,480
Ingenuity that has allowed us to stay on

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,000
this track and allow Computing to be

252
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
faster and faster better and better to

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,320
accomplish so many things including in

254
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,120
biology and you as you probably well

255
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,200
know sequencing has gotten cheaper and

256
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,200
cheaper it used to cost hundred million

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,160
doar to sequence a genome and it um the

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880
the reduced costs of this have even

259
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,920
broken More's law even better than

260
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,959
computing

261
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,240
uh over time and so you think okay well

262
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,680
this is great technology is great let's

263
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,720
do the same for drug Discovery and it at

264
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,920
first looks like an awesome picture but

265
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,079
then you notice wait a second um the

266
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,360
scale is wrong and upside down here

267
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,040
because instead of looking at how many

268
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
at the cost of a drug going down and

269
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,360
down over time instead what we're

270
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,720
looking at here is exactly the opposite

271
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,440
that um in the 1940s you could get uh 30

272
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,680
new drugs if you had a billion dollars

273
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,920
even in today's dollars um but now it's

274
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,600
somewhere between1 to6 billion dollar

275
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,399
per drug and this is absolutely not

276
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,160
scalable to um to rare diseases or even

277
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,000
even the the more common ones that we

278
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,959
have so we call this a room's law

279
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,399
because it's More's law backwards and

280
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,240
it's something that really needs to be

281
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,480
fixed and why is it so expensive why

282
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,920
hasn't it why has it gotten more

283
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,839
expensive over time even though we have

284
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,880
all these amazing molecular techniques

285
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,160
cell biological techniques computational

286
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,440
techniques and yet it's getting more

287
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,920
expensive over time um the answer is

288
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,920
first of all there are just a lot of

289
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,639
steps in drug Discovery this um

290
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,880
simplifies it quite dramatically but

291
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,760
there's hundreds of steps along the path

292
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,279
from having an idea of what might cause

293
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,040
a disorder what are the proteins

294
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,880
involved what are the pathways involved

295
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,079
to then finding a small molecule or

296
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,600
another uh type of um fix for the

297
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,160
disorder and then all the testing in

298
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,160
cell systems animal systems and and

299
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,959
ultimately in humans for clinical trials

300
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,120
but I would say really that's the time

301
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,480
element the cost element really comes

302
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,560
down to this that drug fails most of the

303
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,760
time and so even with everybody's best

304
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,600
efforts all of our Ingenuity all of our

305
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,480
hopes and dreams going into drugs that

306
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,880
go into a human clinical trials 90% of

307
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,480
them fail um and just things just don't

308
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,160
work the way we expect because humans

309
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,959
are a very complex system and chemistry

310
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,120
doesn't always work out um for small

311
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,519
molecules um gene therapy doesn't always

312
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,839
work out and so um this is the real

313
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:58,600
struggle of why it's so so expensive to

314
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,959
um to cure illnesses okay but maybe

315
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,040
robots will come to our rescue um or at

316
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,560
least um Ai and machine learning you may

317
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,720
have seen a lot of um a lot of headlines

318
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,279
about the new advancements and there are

319
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680
many and they are very exciting I don't

320
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,839
know that they're going to um reverse a

321
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,079
room's law um in the upward Trend but

322
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,360
even if we could just stabilize um we

323
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,279
would be quite delighted and it turns

324
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,600
out that the a lot of these Pharma

325
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,240
companies that have been built from the

326
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,399
ground up with some kind of a a basis of

327
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,959
using large scale data and using uh

328
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,720
computational Tech techniques um they

329
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,720
are are starting to get drugs into

330
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,560
clinical trials it's too EAS too early

331
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120
to say whether these will be

332
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,199
dramatically different than um and

333
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,480
faster in the pre-clinical stage or

334
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,959
whether the success rates will be

335
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,800
different there's just too few that have

336
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,199
actually gone to human clinical trials

337
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,839
but there's at least some inklings on

338
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,880
the horizon so today what we'll talk

339
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,320
about is not the entire field of AI and

340
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,040
Drug Discovery but rather some very

341
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,519
specific areas where I'm seeing progress

342
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,519
happening in drug discovery where

343
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,560
machine learning together with beautiful

344
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,639
kinds of data and clever new molecular

345
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,680
and and cell biology techniques are

346
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,320
allowing us to make some progress so

347
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,800
that's what we'll talk about today is

348
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,639
and how we use images so you might all

349
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,920
be thinking a lot more if you're in the

350
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,040
rare disease space you might be thinking

351
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,279
a lot about genomics and um molecular um

352
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,680
proteins genes mrnas um but here I'm

353
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,720
talking about images and I'm literally

354
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,199
talking about microscopy images of cells

355
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,800
it seems a little bit of an old school

356
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,839
kind of technique but because

357
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,240
computational methods allow us to

358
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,800
extract information from images and turn

359
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,360
those into numerical data we can then do

360
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
a lot of the same kinds of things we do

361
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,720
with molecular data so there's two big

362
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,560
things I'll talk about today the first

363
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,680
is measuring known phenotypes in images

364
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,279
by which I mean measuring things we know

365
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
we want to look for in images and then

366
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,720
the second half we'll talk about

367
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,480
profiling to characterize samples so

368
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,240
I'll explain what that means as we as we

369
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,399
go along so first off measuring what we

370
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,680
we know we want to measure when we are

371
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,279
looking at images of of these particular

372
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,160
cells here we're just highlighting the

373
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,639
DNA of the cells so these are nuclei

374
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,000
that we're looking at and you can think

375
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,079
about how to cure cancer in this case um

376
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,279
this type of amkl one way is to kill the

377
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,959
cancer cells great if you can do it um

378
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
another approach though when that

379
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,839
doesn't seem to be working out so well

380
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,959
is to just cause the cells to sort of

381
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,440
stabilize just stop proliferating that

382
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,639
that alone would be good enough to to um

383
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,320
solve many types of cancer and so the

384
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,279
researchers we worked with here John

385
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,759
crispino um from Northwestern University

386
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,839
LED this work with a whole team here at

387
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,320
the broad they thought well let's let's

388
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,199
see if we can find some compounds that

389
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,279
push these cells into this polyploid

390
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,800
state where the the DNA has divided but

391
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,399
they've just kind of stabilized they

392
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,519
don't they don't proliferate as quickly

393
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,880
anymore and examples of what this looks

394
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,240
like is shown here on the right and um

395
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,920
we used in this case uh image analysis

396
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,759
software to measure what they knew they

397
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,160
wanted to look for we want nuclei that

398
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,480
are big and have a lot more DNA in them

399
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,360
and so that's what they did in this

400
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,480
experiment very simple kind of readout

401
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,560
from an image analysis perspective but

402
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,360
allows us to screen um tens of thousands

403
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,920
of drugs here at the rooad and identify

404
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,839
that one that was already being used for

405
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,519
other sorts of cancer looked really

406
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,079
promising and they ended up deciding to

407
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,240
test it in a clinical trial for

408
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,279
myofibrosis which was Su which was

409
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,519
successful so this is one of the first

410
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,480
foray here at the bro that that led to a

411
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,839
successful clinical trial and again

412
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
we're looking at the images and we're

413
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,279
measuring a thing that we already know

414
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,079
is is a useful outcome for patients and

415
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,720
and it worked well here leukemia is a

416
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,279
nice thing to study because you can take

417
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,240
blood from the patients and do a lot of

418
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,160
experiments with it it's very kind of

419
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,720
native context so that worked out very

420
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,720
well but now let's turn to this second

421
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,120
kind of way to use images which is

422
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,560
profiling so what if we don't know what

423
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,199
we're looking for what if we're working

424
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,240
in a disease area where we don't know

425
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,720
the genes involved we don't understand

426
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,199
them maybe we know the gene but we don't

427
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,199
really understand the mechanism of how

428
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,000
that causes a disorder in the human

429
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,720
whole organism in these cases we've

430
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,759
really found a lot of use in this

431
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,279
strategy called profiling and what I

432
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,319
mean here is instead of measuring just

433
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,319
the one thing that we care about in this

434
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,440
in the images like how much DNA is

435
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,279
present instead we measure everything we

436
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,399
can about the cells and then we use that

437
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,560
numerical data kind of like a barcode or

438
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,120
like a fingerprint of what is happening

439
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,600
to the cell when this disease is present

440
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,720
and this strategy is called image-based

441
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,440
profiling we often use something called

442
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,440
the cell painting assay I won't describe

443
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,759
today but um that's the assay that

444
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:33,959
labels the cells and um we can think of

445
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,720
an analogy here to human patients so to

446
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,680
many of us we can look at a lot of

447
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,279
little kids and have no clue whether

448
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,079
they might have some kind of underlying

449
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,959
pathology but for pediatricians who

450
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,079
specialize in many of these different

451
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,240
kinds of disorders they have a very

452
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,720
visual very um strong ability to detect

453
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,600
a disorder just based on a picture of a

454
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
human face and so it turns out of course

455
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
computers are pretty good at that too um

456
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,000
if you give them a training set and

457
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,319
explain that these children have down

458
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,199
syndrome these children have Anglin they

459
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:05,919
are able to distinguish these just based

460
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,039
on the facial structure features alone

461
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,640
so what we're doing here with

462
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,720
image-based profiling with cells is the

463
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,160
exact same thing just sort of zooming in

464
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,360
quite a bit so of course you know your

465
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,120
um your dermatologists can tell if your

466
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:23,280
mole is um is uh sketchy looking if you

467
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,919
um if they look at a picture of it um

468
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,160
and your U pathologist can take a slice

469
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,200
of a of a potential cancer and and take

470
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,240
a look at it and see what's going on all

471
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,120
of these are examples where the physical

472
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,080
structure of the thing tells us whether

473
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,919
there's a disease so let's take that

474
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,400
concept and use um cells growing in a

475
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,320
dish which are cheap and easy to acquire

476
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,440
and most importantly we can perturb them

477
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,640
with tens and thousands of uh different

478
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,080
drugs we can knock out all their genes

479
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,520
and see what happens and so on they're

480
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,360
much more manipulated in the in the dish

481
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,360
and yet we can still take pictures and

482
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,840
see what's wrong with these cells when

483
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,960
we knock out this Gene do they look a

484
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,760
little funny and so on so this is the

485
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,000
the field of image-based profiling and

486
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,440
what are some of the things we can do

487
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,640
with it the first example I'll give was

488
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,120
originally an academic project um I take

489
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,600
no credit for this experiment other than

490
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,039
they used our software um in in order to

491
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,919
extract the features that they needed

492
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,360
for this project so what was it um at

493
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,039
the University of Utah they took some

494
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,919
cells and grew them in a dish and

495
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,559
stained them with some stains and then

496
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,320
they knocked out a gene that was known

497
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,039
to cause cerebral cavernous malformation

498
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,280
CCM and when they made that knockout lo

499
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,080
and behold it had an extremely obvious

500
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,919
phenotype you can tell something's wrong

501
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,200
with these cells they're much more green

502
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,400
the red stuff is much more bright and um

503
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,679
what that means is now you can take

504
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,919
cells that are in this unhealthy disease

505
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,080
Associated State and test drugs

506
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,000
systematically can I find a drug that

507
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,159
makes the unhealthy cells look healthy

508
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,360
again and what's lovely about this kind

509
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,280
of a of an experimental setup is uh

510
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
these researchers happen to be experts

511
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,799
in CCM but you don't actually have to be

512
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,120
an expert just knock out the gene that

513
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,200
causes the disorder and look at the

514
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,919
cells is there something wrong with them

515
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,520
and you can look at them of course by ey

516
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,559
which they did originally here but you

517
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,320
can also look at them with a computer to

518
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,000
get much more subtle effects if it had

519
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,080
been more subtle maybe you'd need a

520
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,880
computer to detect this now in this case

521
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,120
it was obvious and what they did is they

522
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,159
chose some drugs out of this big screen

523
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,320
after doing this experiment they

524
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,799
examined every pair of images by ey and

525
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,760
they also let the computer pick some um

526
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,440
some of the uh drugs to follow up on it

527
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,240
turns out the ones the computer picked

528
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,400
were actually better than those chosen

529
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,799
by the experts and eventually led to a

530
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,840
drug which is now um in phase two

531
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,640
clinical trials as part of recursion so

532
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,200
they spun off this company and this was

533
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,880
how this whole um company got started

534
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,600
they now have hundreds and hundreds of

535
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,320
these kinds of phenotypes because this

536
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,320
is a very systematic thing you don't

537
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,360
have to study each disease for decades

538
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,360
you just if it's a loss of function kind

539
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,400
of disease where the gene function can

540
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,440
just be perturbed we can just see is

541
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,919
there a phenotype if yes screen a bunch

542
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,440
of drugs to to fix it and that's the the

543
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,320
systematic approach that they're taking

544
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,360
within this company they now have eight

545
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,240
eight clinical trials in

546
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,440
progress okay so back to my lab we

547
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,720
realized this is really powerful to be

548
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,080
able to analyze images in a systematic

549
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,760
way and so about uh five years ago I

550
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,559
helped to organize this large Consortium

551
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,200
consisting of the number of Pharma

552
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,240
partners that you see here as well as a

553
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,679
lot of academic collaborators and and

554
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,080
other um service providers in the

555
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,600
biotech space and what we did is we

556
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,240
created giant data set which is now

557
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,480
available and you can see the the

558
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,120
website and and what we've produced here

559
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,840
but what's really lovely about it was

560
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,640
we've taken cells and we've said let's

561
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,120
just create one Baseline data set that

562
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,080
has lots and lots of genes that have

563
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,480
either been knocked down using crisper

564
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,799
or overexpressed um and also a lot of

565
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,880
different small molecules and we can use

566
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,880
this resource for all kinds of different

567
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,760
things I'll just highlight a couple of

568
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,760
them

569
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,480
today the first is to just learn more

570
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,679
about your learn more about the gene or

571
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,880
the chemical perturbation so um there's

572
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,760
20,000 genes in the human genome and

573
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,360
weirdly enough to me if you had asked me

574
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,039
20 years ago I would have thought by now

575
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,320
we would have a decent idea on the

576
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,159
function of most of them but um many

577
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,039
have zero function annotated some of

578
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,200
them have a function that's been

579
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,039
described but it's not the whole story

580
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
and so what's lovely about this data set

581
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,159
is you can um go to the website type in

582
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,679
your Gene of interest and find out about

583
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,880
um about the impact of either over

584
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,559
expressing or knocking down that Gene in

585
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,799
this given cell line what do the cells

586
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,360
look like um are there other genes that

587
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,279
produce similar kinds of phenotypes um

588
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,799
we've used the term nodal biology today

589
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,919
maybe I should Define it before we go

590
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,559
too too much further that um if it's the

591
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,039
case that every single variant um and

592
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,720
every single Gene is completely

593
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,640
different and completely unique and we

594
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,640
have to solve them all one to one

595
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,080
hand-to-hand combat it's going to take a

596
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,480
very long time but what if it's the case

597
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,200
that multiple variants have actually

598
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,600
kind of the same impact on protein

599
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,799
function or multiple genes when they're

600
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,000
perturbed have kind of the same impact

601
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:09,640
on an overall pathway it turns out there

602
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,480
are certainly many examples where this

603
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,520
does happen and if we can step one um

604
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,880
group all of the variance or the genes

605
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,679
into some categories some nodes and find

606
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,159
some common commonalities amongst them

607
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,120
then we have a better chance of dividing

608
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,720
and conquering and so that's um uh one

609
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,240
of the ideas here is that if you type in

610
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,799
your Gene you find other genes that are

611
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,480
similar to it that might give you some

612
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,640
Clues okay maybe my Gene has no

613
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,640
functional annotation but if it if its

614
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,679
impact on cells is exactly the same as

615
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,760
some other Gene that is annotated it

616
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,440
gives me a bit of a clue on on which way

617
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,360
to go or maybe the morphological

618
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,840
features tell me something ah in this

619
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,720
one the the DNA is is uh has a funny

620
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,200
texture or in that one the mitochondria

621
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,120
are um are located in an unusual

622
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,960
location and so on the other cool thing

623
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,919
we can do when we have a giant database

624
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,080
like this is we can start going hunting

625
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,080
for um drugs and so let's say I have a

626
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,720
gene that I know is associated with a

627
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,880
human disorder and I perturb it and I do

628
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,039
see a phenotype like I described um in

629
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,640
the case of recursion um in the

630
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:16,200
beginning so once we see that it has a

631
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,559
phenotype I can say in this database of

632
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,360
all of these cell images that I've

633
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,200
created have I ever seen a drug that

634
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,760
produces that same kind of impact or the

635
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,279
opposite kind of impact on cells and by

636
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,000
doing this matching exercise it's a

637
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:33,200
pretty straightforward computer vision

638
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,240
approach we are able to filter down all

639
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,200
the hundreds of thousands of compounds

640
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,279
or genetic perturbations and look for

641
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
matches so we did this in one experiment

642
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,039
where we had 30,000 profiles to match

643
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,440
against and we typically picked um 20 or

644
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,520
30 uh drugs to follow up on that looked

645
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,159
like they would impinge on the gene of

646
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,120
interest and sure enough um it doesn't

647
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,840
work all the time it would be kind of a

648
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,159
miracle if it if it did because this

649
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,720
step usually costs a few Millions to

650
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,360
tens of of millions of dollars to run a

651
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,000
high throughput screen to physically

652
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,240
test compounds to to determine whether

653
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,080
they have some kind of impact that

654
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,799
you're looking for instead we're taking

655
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,760
that one year and10 million and doing a

656
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:13,120
computational query in an afternoon you

657
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,520
don't expect it to work all the time but

658
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,320
we were shocked to find that it worked

659
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,279
32 to 42% depending how you count

660
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,960
exactly um and you can read the paper

661
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,400
for more details one particular case we

662
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,399
used Yap one as the query Gene because

663
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,679
we knew it was important in a a rare

664
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,440
type of cancer called saroma and and

665
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,159
identified some drugs that looked really

666
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,799
promising for it so promising that we

667
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,360
spun off a little company to get started

668
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,120
and at trying to attack these types of

669
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,559
of cancer and solid

670
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,240
tumors okay so now we're getting really

671
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,640
excited about scaling things up if we

672
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,600
can gather large sets of images we have

673
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,880
the the potential to um to solve lots of

674
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,000
lots of disorders in parallel and so we

675
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,520
see this vision of a future um here at

676
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,840
the road largely led by anag grea of

677
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,840
this um this to function um pathway

678
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,320
where okay sequencing we've got that

679
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,279
down pat and we're very good at it and

680
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,960
it's lot lot cheaper than it used to be

681
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,960
so we can find variants that are

682
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,279
associated with disorders but then how

683
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,039
do we go from there to drugs and one way

684
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,880
is through this kind of profiling I am

685
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,720
excited about profiling with morphology

686
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,720
because it's very inexpensive and very

687
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,640
scalable kind of Technology but we can

688
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,600
also use transcriptomes and proteomes in

689
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,159
order to capture all the information

690
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,480
when this um change in the DNA code is

691
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,399
there what do I see as the impact on the

692
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,960
cell and by doing this we can do two

693
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,080
kinds of things we can immediately gain

694
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,880
phenotypic insights like the DNA looks

695
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,559
funny the mitochondria looks funny the

696
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,600
MRNA levels look odd um but we can also

697
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,679
classify these variants and that's where

698
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,039
we get to the nodal bio biology we can

699
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,640
find the nodes that group a lot of

700
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,799
different variants or different genes

701
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,640
with each other and that allows us to

702
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,320
either um uh find diseases and try to

703
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,080
reverse them with drugs either

704
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,520
computationally like I described or

705
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,640
through physical experiments um or we

706
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,559
can we can kind of go the oldfashioned

707
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
way and and really dive into each

708
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,080
disease once we know a little bit more

709
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,720
about its mechanism so I'll my last

710
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,760
project that I'll describe is a very

711
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,919
large one it's called project ver champ

712
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,640
and our goal is to um it it as you can

713
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,279
see a very large group of people are

714
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,840
involved in this project I'll just talk

715
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,279
about a tiny bit of it today which is um

716
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,440
but the big picture is taking 880,000

717
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,080
coding variants um it's not every

718
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,360
coating variant that exists in humans

719
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,080
but it's a lot of them and um and you

720
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,000
can see some of the details here some

721
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,559
are known to be benign some are known to

722
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,240
be pathogenic and some are uncertain and

723
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,880
we're working to get these all cloned

724
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,840
and tested and and what are we going to

725
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,559
do with them once we have them we're

726
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,679
going to measure all the things about

727
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:50,120
them so when this variant is present

728
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,600
what happens to the cells the there's

729
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,559
other parts of the project that are

730
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,279
working on testing does this variant

731
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,960
cause the protein um in which the

732
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,440
variant exists is it causing that

733
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,200
protein to interact differently with

734
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,880
other proteins um the second one is when

735
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,440
that variant is present does the amount

736
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,919
of the protein change does it knock it

737
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
out completely for example um but we'll

738
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,440
talk today about the localization and

739
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,200
morphology since that's what my lab has

740
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,600
been working on directly does this

741
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,159
variant have any impact on the

742
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,760
localization or the morphology of the

743
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,960
cells so here it's a collaboration with

744
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,000
Miko typal who um did a beautiful

745
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,080
experiment with his um graduate student

746
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,279
Jessica lacost and here's one example of

747
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,679
how this works you take a protein that's

748
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,840
known to be associated with a human

749
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,559
disorder you express it in cells and tag

750
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,640
it so you can see it and so here's three

751
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,000
cells three kind of dark oval nuclei are

752
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,960
not shown in the middle and then the

753
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,919
green stuff is around it and then you

754
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,679
just say well um if I introduce this

755
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,120
variant that's associated with Nunan

756
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,679
syndrome does that localization change

757
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,559
and I don't have to know anything about

758
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,480
Nunan syndrome or this protein or its

759
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,200
normal function or even what these dots

760
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,200
are I can see there's a difference and

761
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,600
then all I have to do is test a bunch of

762
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,720
drugs to see if I can find one that

763
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,480
reverses it so in the same way that a a

764
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,000
pediatrician I wouldn't notice that

765
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,080
there's anything unusual about this boy

766
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,279
but a pediatrician specializing in Nunan

767
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,840
syndrome certainly would be able to tell

768
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,159
um I can look at the cell images and see

769
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,320
that there's a difference so that's the

770
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,880
idea of the of the project they tested

771
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,840
3,000 variants in this in this initial

772
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,279
pilot experiment now as I said we're

773
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,559
scaling to 880,000 but not there yet but

774
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,559
in the initial 3000 they found around

775
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,440
250 disease phenotypes that were um

776
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,960
discovered most of them were associated

777
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,720
with pathogenic um phenotypes and here's

778
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,840
some examples of what those um

779
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,880
phenotypes look like and um some are

780
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,480
pretty common Pathways that we notice so

781
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,279
um for example it wasn't very common for

782
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,200
there to be a mislocalization between

783
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,679
tubulin and cytoplasm but it was

784
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,480
extremely common to find mislocalization

785
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,440
between the plasma membrane and the ER

786
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,840
for example you can see a lot of traffic

787
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,960
let's say coming between those two

788
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,200
compartments so here again we're trying

789
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,840
to group these variants into classes

790
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,159
where is it possible we could find a

791
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,760
drug that would that would um treat

792
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,360
every single one of those maybe 30 to 50

793
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,679
that are in that pathway that are

794
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,320
mislocalized between these two

795
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:13,559
compartments maybe so so let's give it a

796
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,519
shot um how are we going to do this

797
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,519
though because um at at the broad we

798
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,360
certainly can do drug screens and we we

799
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,880
do a number of them each year but they

800
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,080
are expensive and now we have 250

801
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,440
disease phenotypes we can't afford to do

802
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,080
250 diseases times 30,000 or 100,000

803
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,240
drugs so how are we going to break this

804
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,880
bottleneck we'll use technology that was

805
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,799
developed by Paul Blay's lab and then

806
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,960
perfected by JT Neil in order to allow

807
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,320
this kind of localization screening and

808
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,440
here's the basic idea um and which we're

809
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,000
running right now in a pilot experiment

810
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,919
um funded by ladders to cures where in

811
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,159
each well we have a single compound so

812
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,880
one potential drug already FDA approved

813
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,960
if it works well it's like a a really

814
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,679
good candidate so in each well we put

815
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,200
one single drug but we put a mixture of

816
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,399
the 250 or so diseases um and so it's

817
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,320
it's the the normal healthy version of

818
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,360
the Gene and also the um unhealthy

819
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,240
disease Associated version throw them

820
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,279
all in there um but each one has a

821
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,640
barcode so we know which one's which and

822
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,120
that allows us to do this decoding where

823
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,279
the first step is we look at the

824
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,240
localization does it have the healthy or

825
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,399
unhealthy version uh of this

826
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,080
localization and then the second step I

827
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:26,600
won't describe the details is where we

828
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,720
um do this barcode detection where each

829
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,000
Little Dot of light is call in us either

830
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,960
G A TC and it's flashing over many

831
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,679
cycles to tell us the the identity of

832
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,200
the barcode which tells us which for

833
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,679
this little cluster of cells which Gene

834
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,760
did they get and is it the healthy

835
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,240
version or the diseased version so for

836
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,039
each little island of cells we find out

837
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,200
did this drug make the unhealthy version

838
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,480
of the protein go back to its normal

839
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,960
healthy location and that's the idea of

840
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,480
the project we're just in the pilot

841
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,480
stages of being able to do this drug

842
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,799
screening and so now we're hoping ing

843
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,720
these 80,000 variants lead to many

844
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,559
thousands of these phenotypes which we

845
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,200
can then put into this drug screening um

846
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,840
here we're testing it in a single cell

847
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,519
type but eventually we could test it

848
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,639
over many over

849
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,200
time and so with that I'm very happy to

850
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,919
take questions and looking forward to

851
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,080
the discussion for the rest of the day

852
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,080
thank

853
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,720
you and please come right up to the the

854
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,720
microphone if you don't mind

855
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,120
thank you great talk happy to learn so

856
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,240
many exciting applications of IM based

857
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,440
profiling so my question that can you

858
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,919
comment the possibility using Imaging

859
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,679
based profiling how to design a

860
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,519
combinatorial drug Discovery how to

861
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,960
design combination drug Discovery

862
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,120
combination drug Discovery ah yeah yeah

863
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,760
so everything that I described um you

864
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,480
can put whatever you like in the wells

865
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,519
to treat the cells so if you have

866
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,880
combination therapies if you think maybe

867
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,600
um a two panels of drugs you might like

868
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,080
to combine you can absolutely test them

869
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,039
together and see if they have the impact

870
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,360
that you're looking for it's possible to

871
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,559
use the AI based algorithm to predict

872
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,000
the combination yeah yeah and so there's

873
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,000
a lot of research out there to say okay

874
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,880
if I perturb one gene I get this output

875
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,919
what if I perturb two genes is it sort

876
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,960
of the additive effect of the two is it

877
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,480
the multiplicative effect of the two or

878
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,320
do I expect them to interact in some

879
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,120
weird way so I've seen this often with

880
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,720
genes than with compounds like at least

881
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,840
with genes you have an idea of what

882
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,000
you're perturbing in the in the cell um

883
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,039
but the same principle applies for for

884
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,760
chemicals as well where um you can take

885
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,000
large data sets with individual

886
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,519
perturbations and maybe a small data set

887
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,440
that has the combinations and try to

888
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,720
learn from that to be able to predict

889
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,960
the combinatorial effects how well it

890
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,399
works depends right now there I've only

891
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,120
seen a couple of experiments in this

892
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:57,679
mostly in the transcriptomic space not

893
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,080
the image based space um but it seems

894
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,919
like like um it's at least promising

895
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,960
let's say um but I I I think it's too

896
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,080
early to say whether it's um going to be

897
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,080
possible to really predict the the

898
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,320
outcomes from scratch like that thank

899
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,000
you yeah thank you for the

900
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,159
question beautiful talk so I'm thinking

901
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,399
about how do you think about going from

902
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,919
cells to patients right the you know

903
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:21,320
that Discovery in the cells of changing

904
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,240
the phenotypes how do you consider all

905
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,880
the physiology all the pathophysiology

906
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,440
and all of that um what's your process

907
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,399
of thinking through that yeah yeah it's

908
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,200
a it's a very great point so um most of

909
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,600
my research has focused on clearly the

910
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,559
early drug Discovery stage right um You

911
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,720
don't go from a cell experiment to

912
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,919
giving humans um a drug the next day and

913
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,240
so for most um I would expect that for

914
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,440
most projects if you did find an already

915
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,960
FDA approved drug that let's say looks

916
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,880
like it reverses a localization

917
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,880
phenotype in the cell based assay um the

918
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,799
next step in my mind would be to try to

919
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,919
find some animal model of the disorder

920
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,480
to to try to try to see whether you have

921
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,480
the same impact at the whole organism

922
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,480
level

923
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,320
um but it also depends on what the drug

924
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,760
is if it's a very innocuous um not too

925
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,480
scary you know vitamin or neutraceutical

926
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,919
or something like this you might be a

927
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,440
little more inclined to give it a try

928
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,200
whereas if it's a nasty cancer drug you

929
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,040
might be a little more reluctant to

930
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,480
immediately try to give it to patients

931
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,119
um it's beyond my it's my beyond my pay

932
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,280
grade this is where the MD phds should

933
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,760
get involved but well I'm think of even

934
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,200
ways of you're recruiting you know lar

935
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,800
large language models and other things

936
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,520
to be able to inform better mechanism of

937
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,480
saying hey this is more amenable to a a

938
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,119
change right like something in a dish or

939
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,079
something that's in you know a leukemia

940
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,079
that you're describing um those seem

941
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,679
like just better Target so to speak is

942
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,760
there some way of compressing the use

943
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,320
right now of consultants and MD phds and

944
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,320
actually having some more um I don't

945
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,960
know like logical flow that is

946
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,800
programmed to evaluate these compounds

947
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,440
you're generating oh that's it's a it's

948
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,040
a great point so let's say for example

949
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,720
out of an experiment you get either a

950
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,520
list of gen that look like promising

951
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,640
targets or you get a list of compounds

952
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,160
or drugs that look like potentially

953
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,800
useful I absolutely see there's some

954
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,920
potential for large language models that

955
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,880
can synthesize the existing biomedical

956
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,320
literature and just say Okay out of

957
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,240
these 10 you know these maybe make sense

958
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,160
or these might make me a little nervous

959
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,079
because of these side effects or so on

960
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,400
and so kind of interpreting those lists

961
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,680
for clinicians to use their judgment as

962
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,200
they're thinking about it there's

963
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,640
definitely potential there but as

964
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,240
everyone is well aware there's also

965
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,280
hallucinations and so building um these

966
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,320
AI systems that are capable of um

967
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,440
accessing real data providing you the

968
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,320
direct link to the to the underlying

969
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,040
data resource those will be really

970
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,520
important as we're trying to interpret

971
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,520
these these kinds of um

972
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:52,440
experiments hi um beautiful talk

973
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,599
um as you may remember I'm focused on

974
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:59,880
ALS I was yesterday at the natural um

975
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:03,000
ALS Consortium uh to understand patients

976
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,119
um 80% of patients that who develop ALS

977
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,040
have we calling um I guess

978
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,160
non-genetic sporadic yeah at the same

979
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,680
time um when we take um stem cells and

980
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,760
and generate motor neurons from these

981
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,480
patients it's kind of an undiscussed

982
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,280
Topic in the field but they all seem to

983
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,599
have

984
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,240
phenotypes and so for me that says and I

985
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,079
think most people would agree with that

986
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,839
there's probably a genetic component

987
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,760
even in what we don't call genetic ALS

988
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,280
yeah and so there's a lot of variance

989
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,079
obviously in a lot of different genes

990
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,640
and Pathways that could be involved in

991
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,599
development of

992
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,200
disease this is kind of a big bottleneck

993
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,440
for the field at this moment because we

994
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,960
don't understand which patients we

995
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,240
should Target with what type of

996
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,200
therapies do you think because I don't

997
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,880
know how your variants were selected but

998
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,839
do you think your technology would also

999
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,240
be uh able to kind of identify maybe you

1000
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:59,599
know unknown variants and and and the

1001
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,760
Rel ship to disease I love this question

1002
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,160
because especially at the Brad we're

1003
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,720
pretty genome obsessed and but it turns

1004
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,440
out DNA is not everything and mRNA is

1005
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,319
not everything sometimes there are

1006
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,319
disease phenotypes that manifest at

1007
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,160
levels sort of beyond that protein and

1008
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:15,560
onward and just morphological

1009
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,760
infrastructural phenotypes and so I

1010
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,960
think that um profiling Technologies

1011
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,000
like Imaging and transcriptomics

1012
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,000
proteomics can play a role in this

1013
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
ideology of like what are these how do

1014
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,240
we classify these patients into groups

1015
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,640
that make mechanistic sense and might be

1016
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,359
treated in the in the same way and so a

1017
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,359
whole another um approach I didn't

1018
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,400
describe today is to take patient cell

1019
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,920
lines and grow cells in a dish we've

1020
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,880
done this for a few disorders so far

1021
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,800
where we try to identify from the

1022
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,680
patient samples are we able to group um

1023
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,000
the samples in some kind of meaningful

1024
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,119
way that gives us some kind of clue as

1025
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,960
to what the shared mechanisms might be

1026
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,319
in different classes of patients and I

1027
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,960
think that's a real potential here and

1028
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:00,480
have you thought about taking um very

1029
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,760
from patients and and introducing those

1030
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,800
variants into cells yep and then making

1031
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,800
isogenic cell lines it turns out if you

1032
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,839
want to make an isogenic cell line by

1033
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,440
introducing a mutation um it's a very

1034
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:13,280
clean experiment um from a like a design

1035
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,760
perspective it's a little messy when it

1036
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,839
turns out because when you clone the

1037
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,280
cells they turn into like multiple

1038
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,200
independent snowflakes and so if you if

1039
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,359
you um if you don't even knock out the

1040
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,160
cell but just um knock out the gene but

1041
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,440
make 10 copies of a cell line they all

1042
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,599
look a little different from each other

1043
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,599
so there's if there's strong a phenotype

1044
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,680
you will certainly see it in the

1045
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,680
isogenic case but it's not quite as as

1046
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,240
easy and simple as one might hope so if

1047
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,000
phenotypes are weak it's still very

1048
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,520
challenging it's yeah still challenging

1049
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,839
but the only way to know is to try so

1050
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,880
empirically I think it's a really good

1051
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,880
thing to try okay thank you yeah yeah

1052
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,079
sure hi thank you so much it was a

1053
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,640
really wonderful talk um question was

1054
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,760
already commented on a little bit but I

1055
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,240
was curious about the technology um and

1056
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,880
its application and understanding

1057
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,160
variance of unknown significance um if

1058
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,040
you could look at using the different uh

1059
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,200
localization to try and understand those

1060
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,839
better and maybe reclassify absolutely

1061
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,160
that's that's really the fundamental

1062
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,000
goal of of that project is to um is to I

1063
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,760
mean for the pathogenic ones to keep

1064
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,640
moving along towards drugs but for the

1065
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,240
unknown significance ones to group them

1066
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,720
do these look more like the pathogenic

1067
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,560
or more like the benign so that is

1068
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,480
absolutely one use of of this kind of

1069
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,920
data and we've seen a number of

1070
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,240
different examples sometimes um it's

1071
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,760
like pathogenic and benign other times

1072
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,040
it's like three different class es of

1073
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,200
pathogenic and then benign and and

1074
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,960
sometimes you can't tell the difference

1075
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,040
at all because it's not a localization

1076
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,760
problem it's some kind of other

1077
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,560
functional problem so we see across the

1078
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,160
board all different things thank you

1079
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,160
great thanks

1080
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:50,400
everybody and that was amazing um but uh

1081
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,480
following up on our long Now 10e history

1082
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,319
um of uh celebrating this uh particular

1083
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,839
day we've always been uh very focused on

1084
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,040
uh in equal parts celebrating the

1085
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,839
science and actually uh the other

1086
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,160
members of the community who are just as

1087
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,720
important either because they're

1088
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,560
scientists themselves or because they're

1089
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,520
pushing the science forward and of

1090
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,280
course I mean the parents or the family

1091
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,880
members The Advocates the people who

1092
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,040
really make this community work um I

1093
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,599
think and um to paraphrase um Margaret

1094

me me um do not underestimate what a

1095
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,560
motivated group of parents can do to

1096
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,200
change the world indeed it's the only

1097
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,400
thing that ever has and so on that theme

1098
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,839
it is my honor to introduce you to two

1099
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,680
parents who are doing incredible things

1100

um in this area so aah Leo and Nathan

1101
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,520
guo um are uh both here to represent the

1102
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,920
zttk sunshine Foundation I think they'll

1103
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,800
tell you much more about their work but

1104
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,839
I just want to say um for our um ladder

1105
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,079
secures accelerator an important uh

1106
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,960
collaborators also the Chan Zuckerberg

1107
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,160
initiative and they have been successful

1108
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,680
in securing funding for their

1109
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,319
organization and so um It's a Wonderful

1110
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,200
to explore ways in which uh we can all

1111
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:57,680
work together the scientists and the

1112
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,319
parents and uh Patient Advocates so I

1113
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,510
leave it to you to tell us more about

1114
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:06,319
your work thank you thank you so

1115

much thank you so much to the terier

1117
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,119
foundation and the broad Institute for

1118
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,079
having us here today to speak to all of

1119
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:21,280
you my name is aah Leo this is my

1120
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:24,480
husband Nathan guo we are parents to our

1121
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:28,720
2-year-old son Lucas whom we call

1122
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,920
endearingly luki we're also patient

1123
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:36,160
advocacy group leaders of the zttk

1124
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,440
sunshine foundation advocating for luki

1125
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,920
and others like him with

1126
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,319
ctk syndrome and ultra rare neural

1127
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,560
developmental

1128
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:51,880
disorder today it is such an honor to

1129
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,200
share our journey to accelerate a cure

1130
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,280
for

1131
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:01,240
zttk I will start off by first defining

1132
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,240
what is even a cure for us and how

1133
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:07,000
critical it is to integrate patient

1134
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,640
Insight in our journey and then my

1135
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,200
husband Nathan will walk through the

1136
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,680
research road map integrating patient

1137
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,520
insight and how some of you can share

1138
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,160
your Innovative work as part of our

1139
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,319
journey we hope you will walk away today

1140
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,440
from our talk with more insights into

1141
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:30,880
how partnering with patient advocacy

1142
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:35,079
groups like ours can increase the impact

1143
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,079
in innovation in rare disease

1144
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,119
research so first I want to get some

1145
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,160
insights from the audience what is

1146
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,720
secure how many of you here think you

1147
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:51,599
have a precise definition of what is a

1148
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,599
cure by a quick show of

1149
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,599
hands great I see a few hands

1150
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,240
Now by another quick show of hands how

1151
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,760
many of you are quite uncertain about

1152
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,559
what is a

1153
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:15,000
cure great I see many hands in the

1154
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:18,319
audience great in fact when we talk to

1155
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,160
other patient advocacy groups and even

1156
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:29,079
within our own ctk Community there is no

1157
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:32,160
UniFi definition of what is a cure

1158
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,920
so how do Nathan and I think about what

1159
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,599
is

1160
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,119
secure we would like to borrow a

1161
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,200
framework from healthc Care

1162
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:44,040
Professionals this is a framework they

1163
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,720
use when administering safe medications

1164
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,240
we believe it is also applicable to how

1165
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,240
we think about rare disease

1166
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:58,760
research it is giving the right drug at

1167
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,520
the right dose at the right route to the

1168
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,680
right patient at the right

1169
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:09,240
time while we think dose and Route are

1170
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,760
important today we're going to focus on

1171
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:15,760
defining the right drug for the right

1172
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,760
patient at the right

1173
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,400
time to understand what is the right

1174
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,760
drug we have to first understand what is

1175
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,800
the disease zttk

1176
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,760
syndrome was discovered in 2016 by four

1177
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,119
researchers it is an ultra rare

1178
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,079
neurodevelopmental disorder it is a

1179
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:42,839
monogenic disease caused by mutation in

1180
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:45,760
the son Gene it is diagnosed primarily

1181
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,880
through whole exome or genome

1182
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,960
sequencing our community is growing we

1183
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,400
have estimated roughly 300 families

1184
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:58,480
around the world we believe many remain

1185
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:02,200
undiagnosed today

1186
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,880
our phenotypes and symptoms are are wide

1187
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,440
spectrum what we know today is that the

1188
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,960
most prevalent symptoms are Global

1189
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,720
development delays motor delay speech

1190
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,440
delay feeding difficulties and also

1191
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,800
intellectual

1192
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:21,599
disability based on a paper published in

1193
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,599
2021 we know that from the initial ctk

1194
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,240
cohort about

1195
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,839
50% of the patients develop seizures

1196
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:34,240
during

1197
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:34,240
childhood there is currently no cures or

1198
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:42,599
treatment so by looking at this one

1199
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:45,240
might think that one important concern

1200
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:47,800
would be to address the seizure

1201
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,319
burden we know that some other

1202
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,240
neurodevelopmental groups have also

1203
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,040
identified seizures as their primary end

1204
00:45:53,240 --> 00:46:01,800
point and even have drugs in development

1205
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,800
and this is where patient insights are

1206
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:11,559
critical last year we conducted a survey

1207
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:14,559
with our ztk community we asked them

1208
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:17,040
what are the top three symptoms that are

1209
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,160
most important for you and your family

1210
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,520
to address in your

1211
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,119
child

1212
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,800
cognition

1213
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:29,440
speech seizures come in low lower than

1214
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,240
these other

1215
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,160
symptoms we duck a little deeper to

1216
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,559
understand why we collected stories

1217
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,839
anecdotes from our

1218
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:42,920
families some mention that they

1219
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:47,960
prioritize cognition because they hope

1220
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:51,559
for their child to have Independence one

1221
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,400
day some say that they

1222
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:57,480
prioritize speech because they would

1223
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:00,160
like their child to express ex

1224
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:04,480
themselves more freely even if they're

1225
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,480
just basic needs and

1226
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:12,160
emotions and this is where we believe

1227
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:15,079
patient voices are so critical for us to

1228
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,960
Define what is the right

1229
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:20,599
drug but even when we have what matters

1230
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,200
to the entire

1231
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:28,119
Community each family has their own

1232
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:31,520
unique Journey they has their own dreams

1233
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:34,559
and hope for their

1234
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:38,559
children it is up to the individual

1235
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:40,760
patient and family to Define what is the

1236
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,839
right drug for

1237
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,920
them I can only speak for what matters

1238
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,920
to me Nathan and

1239
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:55,839
luki this is our trial son luki he is

1240
00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:00,200
sweet

1241
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:04,079
curious and he is clever in his own way

1242
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:07,599
he's also experiencing profound

1243
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:11,760
challenges at two and a half he spent

1244
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,800
hours every single day working on the

1245
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,800
most basic

1246
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,839
skills the first picture of is of him

1247
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,640
working on standing and walking he's in

1248
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,400
this big equipment called a standard

1249
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,240
that he has to be in for at least an

1250
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,280
hour a day to help

1251
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:35,800
withstanding initially it would break my

1252
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:38,400
heart to strap him to this big equipment

1253
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,520
and he's strong he would fight me

1254
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,800
kicking and shouting to get out of the

1255
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,760
standard but now we are more used to it

1256
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,640
and we even have some fun this is

1257
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,839
actually a photo from last year our

1258
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,400
photo shoot from where is this

1259
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:58,200
day the second picture shows that he's

1260
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:01,440
still working on fine motor skills how

1261
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,319
to point how to pick up a cereal this is

1262
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,040
from a 3-week

1263
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:10,000
intensive that we were in last year

1264
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:13,240
where he was in therapies three hours

1265
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,680
every day for three weeks otpt speech

1266
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,520
therapies just to work on these basic

1267
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,079
skills in his picture he's working on

1268
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:24,079
crawling and after the therapy sessions

1269
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:28,160
he was a able to put a ball in the

1270
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:31,119
container and he was so proud of himself

1271
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:35,400
the look on his face was

1272
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:39,000
priceless now luki is desperate to

1273
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:42,839
communicate with us the only word he can

1274
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,480
say right now is Mama he says it

1275
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:50,240
constantly he says it to everyone and

1276
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,040
everything but I cherish it so much

1277
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,920
because I've also heard from other

1278
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,400
community members that kids may lose

1279
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,839
their speech

1280
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,079
the few words that they have acquired

1281
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:06,400
there may be regression over

1282
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:09,640
time the other pictures of him drinking

1283
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,400
from a straw Cup every meal he's working

1284
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,480
so hard on basic skills to chew to

1285
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,760
swallow and this is one of the first

1286
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,160
pictures of him being able to drink

1287
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:25,160
water out of a straw Cup today he still

1288
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,160
primarily fed by a feeding

1289
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:32,960
tube for Ely he has not had a seizure

1290
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:36,839
yet but it is a fear that is looming

1291
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:40,599
over us every single

1292
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:45,400
day while we don't know when luki will

1293
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:48,839
be able to walk to talk to feed

1294
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,160
independently what we do know is that

1295
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:54,640
which each each day that passes his

1296
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:57,599
brain is not developing the way it

1297
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:01,480
should be

1298
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:03,720
we love luki for who he is but we also

1299
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,839
want him to

1300
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:10,040
fulfill his potential beyond the

1301
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,040
limitations of

1302
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,839
zttk the right

1303
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:20,599
drug is a drug that can help him right

1304
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:25,359
now a drug the right drug may not be the

1305
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:25,359
drug that can help him reverse all his

1306
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:31,040
symptoms the right drug may be a drug

1307
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:36,319
that can improve his

1308
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:39,960
cognition his speech even just a little

1309
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:43,559
bit because like some families in our

1310
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,359
community we also hope for him to have

1311
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:49,880
Independence one

1312
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:54,680
day when we're no longer around we too

1313
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:59,160
hope that he can express himself freely

1314
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,010
maybe one day say Mom Mama and Papa I

1315
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,400
love

1316
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:04,559
[Music]

1317
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:07,720
you as we sit here

1318
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,280
today discussing groundbreaking research

1319
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,799
and

1320
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,480
Innovation I want to thank all of you

1321
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:16,599
and encourage you to think beyond the

1322
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,599
molecules and

1323
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:24,920
data you are giving an

1324
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,920
opportunity to children like

1325
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:34,040
luki and opportunity to rewrite their

1326
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,040
future thank you so

1327
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:45,319
much great so before I start to dive in

1328
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,480
further into the science of this all I

1329
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:51,160
want to First acknowledge that Aiden and

1330
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:54,119
I are very lucky to be here today drug

1331
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,960
development for ultra rare conditions is

1332
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,920
largely driven by parents which is very

1333
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,480
empowering but they we have to

1334
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,040
acknowledge that only parents that have

1335
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,160
sufficient resources the ability to

1336
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,680
access networks like the bro are able to

1337
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:12,200
really be successful at this and so we

1338
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,839
feel a deep obligation to our community

1339
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,079
some of whom are just trying to survive

1340
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:18,559
the dayto day many of whom do not have

1341
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,920
the resources to be able to to progress

1342
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,720
these um treatments and cures so it's

1343
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,680
really important to to acknowledge that

1344
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,920
first up front so in the next few uh

1345
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,280
slides I'll take you through more of the

1346
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,599
science of this right when we think

1347
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,799
about the right drug for the right

1348
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,240
patient of course we need to understand

1349
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:38,160
the underlying biology and then put that

1350
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,000
together with the right time what does

1351
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,359
that mean so on this slide you'll see a

1352
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,359
lot of detail about zttk and the son

1353
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:49,240
Gene biology it's a heterozy mutation

1354
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,599
it's a hlin sufficiency and loss of

1355
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,280
function we haven't seen any toxic gain

1356
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,920
of function almost all of the mutations

1357
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:00,799
we've seen in our community are denovo

1358
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:04,000
um you'll see the to the left side here

1359
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:06,640
um the both the S Gene and the S protein

1360
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,119
you might see a very large Exxon 3 you

1361
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,079
might see both DNA and RNA binding

1362
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,240
motifs you'll see a lot of little

1363
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:16,040
triangles along both the Gene and the

1364
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:19,000
protein these are each triangle

1365
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:21,359
represents one patient documented by our

1366
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,760
lead researcher Dr Arin an at the

1367
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:26,720
University of Alabama at Birmingham what

1368
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,559
you'll see is that scattered across the

1369
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,839
bottom there's a lot of onesz twz

1370
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,000
mutations and then there's also one big

1371
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:35,000
spike that spike is actually about a

1372
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,319
quarter of the population has the same

1373
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,040
four base pair deletion resulting in a

1374
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:41,400
frame shift mutation um we're still

1375
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,720
understanding the genotype phenotype

1376
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,040
correlations but we're continuing to

1377
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,520
learn more about the sanen and its

1378
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,440
function you know our understanding

1379
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,920
today is that the sanen is quite

1380
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:56,000
important um it's a nuclear speckle

1381
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,720
protein it's U believed to be a master

1382
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,240
Reg of many Downstream genes actually

1383
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,040
many of which also have their own

1384
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,839
intellectual disability disorders

1385
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:07,720
attached to them um it's important for

1386
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:10,280
intron excision in prear splicing and

1387
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,599
it's also critical to some regulation of

1388
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,839
some transcription Pathways and you know

1389
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:17,599
it's highly conserved across species and

1390
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:20,359
it's um expressed ubiquitously in the

1391
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:23,319
body so now that we understand a little

1392
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:25,599
bit more about the disease and the

1393
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:27,200
biology we really want to present kind

1394
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,839
of a framework work of how do we

1395
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,359
prioritize our zttk drug development

1396
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,880
efforts because as a a patient advocacy

1397
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:38,599
group we don't we have limited resources

1398
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:41,160
time and money to be able to pursue um

1399
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:43,880
treatments and cures for our kids so

1400
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,400
what I'll uh show on the following page

1401
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,640
is a 2 by two both a and I are ex-

1402
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,880
Consultants so we think everything can

1403
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:53,039
be solved by a 2 by two um on the bottom

1404
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,359
x-axis what you'll see is speed to the

1405
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,359
clinic speed to the clinic is really the

1406
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:00,119
time dimension of this are there

1407
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:03,240
existing approved or clinical stage

1408
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:05,799
drugs for CNS ideally even for rare or

1409
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,480
ultra rare CNS you know that can

1410
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:10,400
indicate that there are you know real

1411
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,039
regulatory Pathways we can leverage

1412
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,160
right it's more much more difficult for

1413
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:19,440
us as an ultra rare group to um you know

1414
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,880
try totally brand new um Pathways and

1415
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,520
then on the y- axis what you'll see is

1416
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,119
kind of all the potential therapeutic

1417
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,119
impact really the right drug for the

1418
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:30,200
right patient right does it actually

1419
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,160
address the patient need that ADA talked

1420
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,079
about earlier that the community has

1421
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,240
identified that the patients identify as

1422
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,319
their primary need what's the mechanism

1423
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,319
of action how safe is it um and

1424
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:43,359
ultimately what's the patient experience

1425
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,079
uh with that so here is the 2 by two

1426
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:48,319
I'll I'll walk you through the different

1427
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:51,079
pieces really a 3X3 um so as I mentioned

1428
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:53,440
on the x-axis speed to the clinic so on

1429
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:55,680
the far right side that is the fastest

1430
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,760
of the clinic things that are much more

1431
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,799
uh likely to be proven um on the y- axis

1432
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,839
what you'll see is kind of the potential

1433
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,559
therapeutic impact and for those of you

1434
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,520
who are a suit you'll probably al

1435
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:09,240
already figure out that you ideally want

1436
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,839
things in the top right corner right

1437
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,960
things that are fast to the clinic and

1438
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,559
have high therapeutic impact

1439
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,720
unfortunately in our case this one's a

1440
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:20,640
little empty um our uh protein is quite

1441
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:23,400
large it's not able to fit in an A9

1442
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,280
Vector also we have not yet identified

1443
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:29,000
any obvious ASO targets so as a result

1444
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:31,400
that remains empty for now as we move

1445
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,720
into the blue category these are the

1446
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,680
ones that we think have the most promise

1447
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,760
um but today what we're doing is really

1448
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,480
spreading our bets across these to

1449
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:44,720
understand what might bear fruit and

1450
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,079
then finally uh you'll see also um a

1451
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,039
number of innovations that have come out

1452
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,160
of the broad a lot of advanced

1453
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:52,520
modalities that are you know just

1454
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,640
entering the clinic um still in early

1455
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,920
translational research but maybe too far

1456
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,960
uh in the future future for us to

1457
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,319
seriously consider at this point but

1458
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,839
obviously hoping that those May

1459
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,760
accelerate so a few comments about this

1460
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:08,119
overall framework first um this is

1461
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,200
really disease specific and even to some

1462
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:13,720
extent uh mutation specific as well so

1463
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,480
for example in our case um it's a four

1464
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,160
based parap frame shift mutation that

1465
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,520
requires that has different drugs

1466
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:24,319
applicable to it than say an inframe

1467
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,839
deletion or a whole Gene deletion so the

1468
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:29,000
context here is really important and you

1469
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:31,160
could really draw a different 3x3 for

1470
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,599
every disease and even subclasses within

1471
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:36,480
the disease the other thing to point out

1472
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,480
is this is not a static chart what this

1473
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,799
is just a view of what we know today and

1474
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:45,520
really the goal of making bets in all of

1475
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:47,559
the blue category here is to identify

1476
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,240
are there Pathways that might move that

1477
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:52,520
into the top right corner these

1478
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,400
modalities will eventually become actual

1479
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:58,119
hits and then actual leads and that will

1480
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,799
be what progresses over time but this is

1481
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:02,960
what we really hope to kind of arm our

1482
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,160
own e efforts and other patient advocacy

1483
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,440
groups as well so maybe just to take you

1484
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,039
through a few examples so um Gene

1485
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,480
replacement therapy is a really common

1486
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:14,920
one I mentioned earlier uh av9 single

1487
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,559
Vector gene therapy ruled out uh you'll

1488
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:20,640
see in the middle the truncated A9 gene

1489
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,799
therapy so a Minon construct or

1490
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,760
something like that it today you know

1491
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,520
our assumption is it may not have the

1492
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,520
full efficacy but we just need to do

1493
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,599
more research to understand how much do

1494
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,760
we actually need to boost son Gene

1495
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:36,319
function and then you also see dual

1496
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,760
Vector gene therapy in the top left um

1497
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:42,079
obviously a lot of experimentation um

1498
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,599
but no uh kind of clinical dual Vector

1499
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:47,599
strategies for CNS there's a couple for

1500
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:51,400
op opthalmological diseases but not for

1501
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,760
CNS another example is Aso um you know

1502
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,880
Exxon skipping Asos kind of out of the

1503
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,960
picture you saw that very large Exxon 3

1504
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:02,119
we can't really skip that um and Al

1505
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:05,200
we're but we are looking at Asos to

1506
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:08,480
promote fulllength sa um expression by

1507
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,520
kind of inhibiting other um isoforms and

1508
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,400
um we'll continue to explore other ASO

1509
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,160
Pathways as well U finally you'll also

1510
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,720
see for the gene editing Technologies

1511
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,559
many of these have come out of the Bro

1512
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,280
of course um but in our case crisper

1513
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:23,760
editing and base editing don't quite

1514
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,359
work for a frame shift mutation Prime

1515
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,480
editing may be a good candidate just

1516
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,359
given the

1517
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,319
we really just need to knock in for base

1518
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:33,119
pairs or just get it in frame um but

1519
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:35,200
hopefully this gives you a bit of an

1520
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,280
understanding of how we might think

1521
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:41,599
about on a disease by disease basis how

1522
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:44,880
to tackle the problem at a systemic um

1523
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,920
level and finally I'd say all of these

1524
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,400
kind of different modalities are

1525
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,400
interdependent and context dependent so

1526
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,000
in our case actually as you've seen

1527
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,839
we've walked through a few of the other

1528
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,559
op options from a genetic medicine's

1529
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:59,680
perspective in our case drug repurposing

1530
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:01,039
may be the most promising route because

1531
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,480
some of the other ones have been ruled

1532
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:05,640
out and especially from the speed to the

1533
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,039
clinic perspective this may be by far

1534
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,920
the fastest option so really I would

1535
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:12,160
encourage the audience to think about

1536
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,240
when you're building up the picture of

1537
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,520
what how to uh uh leverage Innovation to

1538
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,720
really have the impact that we're all

1539
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,920
hoping for we really need to think about

1540
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,240
the holistic picture of the right drug

1541
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,079
and the right patient at the right time

1542
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,960
so you know today the way we're

1543
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,160
approaching this is we're really

1544
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,359
operating a pre-clinical biotech out of

1545
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,200
our foundation so just like any other

1546
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:37,119
pre-clinical biotech what we're doing is

1547
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,880
understanding the Natural History uh of

1548
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,599
the disease which is very limited given

1549
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,039
that it was just discovered in 2016 um

1550
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,240
our lead researcher Dr Aaron an who I

1551
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:49,359
mentioned earlier um published on the

1552
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:51,200
first ztk Mouse model last year um some

1553
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:54,920
of my colleagues at thermop Fisher

1554
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:57,160
developed the first ztk ipscs um and

1555
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,960
we're working on quite a number of

1556
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:02,920
projects to identify both um targets and

1557
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:06,039
hits and also to verify those including

1558
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,799
some projects with the bro as well so on

1559
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:10,200
this page you'll see we have a lot of

1560
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:11,640
projects going on uh in this next year

1561
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,799
not going to go through all of them but

1562
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,760
what I would highlight is you know we

1563
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:18,160
there are projects that we're still

1564
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,839
looking for partners to um work with us

1565
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,319
on um so specifically

1566
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:25,400
proteomics understand which s isopor

1567
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:26,880
show up in which organs to understand

1568
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,880
kind of you know what do we need to

1569
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,039
focus on in the CNS versus liver versus

1570
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,240
stomach Etc um also trying to better

1571
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,920
understand what are the critical

1572
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:38,680
epitopes um to ultimately inform son

1573
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,960
antibody and Eliza assay development and

1574
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,359
you know after an's fabulous talk

1575
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,039
earlier I think we also need to add a

1576
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:47,520
cell morphology project on here as well

1577
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,000
um so you know I would really encourage

1578
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,480
the audience you and the audience to

1579
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,039
think about it uh the framework here

1580
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,359
that we've presented the right cure for

1581
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:57,760
the right patient at the right time and

1582
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:59,880
you know I think think for um scientists

1583
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,240
at the broad and other research

1584
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,640
institutions like this everyone doesn't

1585
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,920
no one wants to do Innovation for

1586
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,359
Innovation sake people want to do

1587
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,799
Innovation to drive real impact and I'd

1588
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:13,319
say that the best way to realize that

1589
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:15,160
impact is to partner with patient

1590
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:18,400
advocacy groups like ours parents like

1591
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:21,079
ourselves who are learning the science

1592
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,200
and could use your help and partnership

1593
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:26,599
in accelerating the work um I'd like to

1594
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:29,079
thank um quite a number of people our

1595
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:31,039
support network Dr Aon an our lead

1596
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:34,160
researcher at the University of Alabama

1597
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:36,240
at Birmingham she is also um a board

1598
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,599
member of our foundation and was a

1599
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:41,640
co-discoverer of zttk syndrome in 2016

1600
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,400
um we have our foundation of course our

1601
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,440
scientific and clinical advisory boards

1602
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,839
and many many partners who have shared

1603
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,319
in-kind resources support all along the

1604
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,839
way so if any of you in the audience are

1605
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:55,200
interested in supporting Aden and I on

1606
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:58,160
our journey to cure zdk please feel free

1607
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,160
to email us at enuo or Alo at ctk.org

1608
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,390
and with that we'll open it up to

1609
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:10,030
questions thank

1610
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:10,030
[Applause]

1611
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:19,200
you I don't need a

1612
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,599
microphone I'm surprised you're not

1613
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:26,000
mentioning the one generic approach

1614
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:29,119
which is to enhance splicing of of the

1615
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,880
wild type copy of the gene that has

1616
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:35,680
proven very effective in spinal muscular

1617
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:39,319
atrophy there are now clinical trials

1618
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:43,559
for a capo insufficient genetic disorder

1619
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:48,400
of the central nervous system D syndrome

1620
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:51,920
it appears to be a genetic type of

1621
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,119
therapy where what one needs to do and

1622
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,480
Tim you on your Advisory Board knows how

1623
01:04:54,119 --> 01:05:01,240
to do it yeah which is scan aligon

1624
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,880
nucleotides to Simply find those that

1625
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:09,559
will enhance splicing of key exons in

1626
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:14,720
the wild type copy of the gene yeah and

1627
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:18,160
that could be a generic therapy for many

1628
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,799
Capo insufficient genetic disorders yeah

1629
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:24,960
absolutely um I'm not as deep on the

1630
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:27,720
oligos signs as timu um the the ulab did

1631
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,440
um spend quite some time scanning for

1632
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,160
kind of obvious ASO targets and

1633
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,920
unfortunately they didn't come up with

1634
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:36,599
anything um I know that of course Stoke

1635
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,559
Therapeutics is working on the Tango

1636
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,000
approach um we've had some initial

1637
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,440
conversations with them about it and

1638
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,440
unfortunately doesn't seem like it's

1639
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,359
applicable at this time but continuing

1640
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,559
to look for other options with that

1641
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:50,520
strategy in mind computer is not

1642
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,359
necessarily the

1643
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:56,359
best thank you thank you little tick

1644
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,359
note

1645
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,079
thank you for talk to sharing my

1646
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:05,880
personal M and inspiring stories and the

1647
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:08,119
Strategic road map for drug disent so my

1648
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:11,640
question that of course the cell and the

1649
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:15,279
dream therapy offer a final C promising

1650
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:18,200
for the disease and how do you evaluate

1651
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:20,960
the possibility we are using the

1652
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:24,319
nutritional interventions like a

1653
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:27,880
supplementary forood supplementary is to

1654
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:30,520
intervine the progession of disease and

1655
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,559
imediate symptoms of

1656
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:35,559
patients yeah it's a it's a great

1657
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,720
question you know I think part of what

1658
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:39,279
we're working on with whenever we're

1659
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,559
thinking about Gathering more natural

1660
01:06:39,279 --> 01:06:43,960
history is even just what are patients

1661
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:46,119
taking today even just Gathering the

1662
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,680
data on what medications what

1663
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:51,440
supplements what diet Etc have patients

1664
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,960
been using might unlock hey actually

1665
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,640
there's quite a few patients that have

1666
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,200
converged on the same kind of Therapies

1667
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:00,400
whether just food or medicine or

1668
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,960
otherwise uh those might even evolve

1669
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,799
over time it might be different in

1670
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,760
childhood versus adulthood Etc so um

1671
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,359
it's something we're working on um to

1672
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,520
really gather that data actually one of

1673
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:12,760
our partners citizen Health um is really

1674
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:15,240
helpful in aggregating a lot of the EHR

1675
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:18,000
data to be able to just observe at least

1676
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:20,279
historically what are our what is our

1677
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,599
community doing but it's a big focus of

1678
01:07:20,279 --> 01:07:24,720
ours we're also working on a project

1679
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:26,359
with um combined brain which is another

1680
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,599
nonprofit in the neurodevelopmental

1681
01:07:26,359 --> 01:07:32,119
space specifically to do metabolomics of

1682
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:34,200
human patients to understand are there

1683
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:36,319
differences we're still trying to

1684
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,960
disentangle is are the

1685
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,319
neurological um features of the disease

1686
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,880
actually being driven potentially by

1687
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:45,839
metabolism itself so uh we're continuing

1688
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,039
to investigate that as well thank you

1689
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,039
very

1690
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,760

01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:39,120
and he is the CEO of unravel and you

1708
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,839
would have seen probably their logo up

1709
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,520

1710
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:45,640
going to be sharing with us about the um

1711
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,920
Partnerships that he's done with

1712
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,000
patients and share more about what that

1713
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,239
looks like from the first time founder

1714
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,719
of first time CEO side of things so

1715
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:55,450
welcome Richard thanks so much I think

1716
01:08:53,719 --> 01:08:58,719
I'm miked up

1717
01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:00,120
[Applause]

1718
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,839
now thank you thank you so much it's a

1719
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,159
it's an honor to be here it really is

1720
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:06,600
thank you to the broad to Anna to uh the

1721
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:10,920
trir foundation uh for this wonderful

1722
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,040
support um as a relatively newly mted

1723
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:17,040
member of biopharma I'm here to share

1724
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:20,359
both good news and bad news um bad news

1725
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:23,000
biopharma really stinks at making drugs

1726
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:25,920
um we get it done eventually with enough

1727
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,920
money I think as Anna uh uh pointed out

1728
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,359
but we're really terrible at it um the

1729
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,839
good news is we believe there's a really

1730
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,960
good solution and that's in in the

1731
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,080
patients themselves they are part of the

1732
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,199
problem that we're trying to solve but

1733
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,159
they are part of the solution and so

1734
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:41,520
what I'm here uh to present today is not

1735
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:44,120
so much the science though we're going

1736
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,120
to dive into it a little bit um it's

1737
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,960
really um how do we make this

1738
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:52,120
infrastructure work for everybody and so

1739
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,960
our uh our strategy at unravel is

1740
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,280
Patients First that is the problem that

1741
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,960
is the Northstar we are singularly aimed

1742
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,640
at that and let's work together to

1743
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,840
figure out how we get there um and and

1744
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,920
we're doing it through a very heavy

1745
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,560
partnering

1746
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:07,199
approach so here is traditional drug

1747
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,040
development um in a very abstract sense

1748
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:11,800
uh but you can see that there's a Target

1749
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,199
this usually comes out of Academia um

1750
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,560
there you know Mouse highlights any sort

1751
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:18,640
of preclinical models cells animal

1752
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,239
models Etc and then you get into the

1753
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,280
critical question does it work in

1754
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:25,000
patience this is what we've been trying

1755
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,600
to do this whole time and um this is

1756
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,760
where my earlier bad news comes in we're

1757
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,640
terrible at this um it takes years if

1758
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,159
it's even going to be successful um on

1759
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,280
average a new target has about a 98%

1760
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:40,719
failure rate uh in terms of this

1761
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:44,080
approval process so this doesn't work

1762
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,520
and this is for non-rare diseases too uh

1763
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,280
but when you get to rare and especially

1764
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:51,679
ultra rare this just doesn't work right

1765
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:53,719
um so what can we do and what you know

1766
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:56,520
kind of digging one layer deeper what's

1767
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:58,920
the problem our is that people are

1768
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,040
trying to treat disease when really we

1769
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,199
should be thinking about treating

1770
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:04,320
patients all right diseases are not the

1771
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:06,000
same as patients and so um a shout out

1772
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,159
to the Cleveland Clinic for these really

1773
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,840
helpful uh Graphics but they represent

1774
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:12,679
the generalities they don't represent

1775
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,000
individual patients

1776
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:16,800
so again what we say is it's the

1777
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,679
patients not the disease that responds

1778
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,000
to the treatment um and here's actually

1779
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:22,840
a picture from our office that reminds

1780
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,760
us this is why we're we're we're here um

1781
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:27,920
and actually lukia is on there as well

1782
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,239
um and so you know this is not a New

1783
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,920
Concept I I would love to be able to

1784
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:33,440
take credit for it uh but it actually

1785
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,000
goes back to the 19th century with

1786
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,000
William oer so the father of modern

1787
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,520
medicine U basically the good per good

1788
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,080
physician treats the disease the great

1789
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,639
physician treats the patient with the

1790
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,760
disease and I think we've lost track of

1791
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:45,440
that along the way and so we're trying

1792
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,480
to bring that back and part of it is

1793
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,560
because the Technologies today enable it

1794
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,159
and part of it is because the the

1795
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,199
patient advocacy groups are so

1796
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:55,239
freakishly sophisticated and and

1797
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:57,080
motivated that now we can do it right so

1798
01:11:55,239 --> 01:12:00,320
so it's this kind of it takes a village

1799
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:03,320
but even more complex concept and so

1800
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,800
what we did at unravel is we have this

1801
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,120
patient-driven drug development and

1802
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,560
there's you know people pay lip service

1803
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,400
to patients and you know every Pharma

1804
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,960
company has a has a has a page that says

1805
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,560
oh you know we're patient Centric that's

1806
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,000
great um but have you actually worked

1807
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,480
with these groups have you worked with

1808
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,280
with the patients right and that that's

1809
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,600
sort of the the question and so and why

1810
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,920
do we start with patience right and and

1811
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,440
to some extent it's obvious but to some

1812
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,000
extent there's there's really deep

1813
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,520
biology and the scientific problem is a

1814
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,800
really big one and I think Anna

1815
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,800
mentioned this really nicely in the

1816
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,159
beginning we have no clue what half half

1817
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,920
of the pathways are doing you have these

1818
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:38,960
these proteins genes that have been

1819
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,280
identified that's great no idea what

1820
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,920
they do or maybe we know one thing out

1821
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:45,719
of you know 100 um the reality is that

1822
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:47,000
what constitutes a patient right now not

1823
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:48,920
just a human but just a patient

1824
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,639
specifically sure genetics in the case

1825
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:54,639
of genetic disorders um the environment

1826
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:57,159
this includes diet medications Etc and

1827
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:58,560
and time and I think uh aah and Nathan

1828
01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:00,239
really nicely alluded to it you know

1829
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,560
when is a really critical question to

1830
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:05,960
ask not just what and how and who um and

1831
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,440
so what we did and we spent out of the

1832
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,120
Harvard uh ecosystem uh so just across

1833
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,560
the water here um out of the VIS

1834
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:15,639
Institute and there we had this Insight

1835
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,440
that these complex biological networks

1836
01:13:15,639 --> 01:13:21,639
Drive clinical function and here's

1837
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:23,360
actually a real example um of one of our

1838
01:13:21,639 --> 01:13:25,639
networks and the idea is that these

1839
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,360
interactions as opposed to any any one

1840
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:29,560
component of this drive patient outcomes

1841
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,120
right it's not it's not it's kind of the

1842
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,159
sum of all the parts now if you have

1843
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:36,120
tried to drive through Boston um for

1844
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,199
example just coming here today um there

1845
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,000
was a a malfunctioning traffic light

1846
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:42,920
turns out that backed up the traffic

1847
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,280
onto sto which backed up onto i93 which

1848
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,120
who knows what what it's doing right so

1849
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,840
one traffic light can have these vast

1850
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,520
effects that's a network problem that

1851
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,960
you encounter every day especially in

1852
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,400
Boston um and so let me walk you through

1853
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,440
you know how we do this so obviously

1854
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,199
this this is teeing up to a computation

1855
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,480
example as you might imagine but the

1856
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,000
idea is that you have this healthy

1857
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,320
Network and again just completely

1858
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,639
arbitrary this is actually from a r

1859
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,760
syndrome patient I'm going to talk about

1860
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,560
later but uh don't worry the yellow

1861
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,920
lines are just for for show here you

1862
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,280
have some sort of healthy interaction

1863
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,239
this is what normally should be

1864
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,960
happening um and there's a problem

1865
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,239
there's a gene maybe that's mutated

1866
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,320
there might be an infection that's

1867
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:18,840
causing something who knows what it is

1868
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,639
um in this case it's um actually the

1869
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,480
mecp2 gene that's highlighted here

1870
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:24,080
there's some problem there mutated node

1871
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,000
and you heard this nodal biology is

1872
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,239
really kind of getting that um so great

1873
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,880
it causes some disruption it's that

1874
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,560
malfunctioning traffic light right so

1875
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,040
how do we fix it well you could fix the

1876
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,760
traffic light but you can also fix

1877
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,880
anything else that rebalances this

1878
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,880
network and that's the really great

1879
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,560
opportunity in biology it's a mess and

1880
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,560
so why focus on just one thing right you

1881
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,639
can take any of that mess and and use it

1882
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:49,840
to your advantage as unfortunately every

1883
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:51,239
oncologist knows cancer cells are really

1884
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,719
good at at finding these alternative

1885
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:54,440
Pathways so why can't we use that for

1886
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,639
for good um and that that's really what

1887
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,320
we do at

1888
01:14:55,639 --> 01:15:00,040
unravel um and essentially what we do

1889
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,320
we're forecasting how patients respond

1890
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,400
to therapies again it's about the

1891
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,280
patient not the disease so we have

1892
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,840
patient RNA signatures from actual

1893
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,239
individual patients that we work with on

1894
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,280
a daily basis and we have drug RNA

1895
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:13,800
signatures and not unlike what what Anna

1896
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,880
showed with with the visual uh visual

1897
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,040
signatures these are really

1898
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,679
transcriptomic signatures but from the

1899
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,719
perspective of these networks and then

1900
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:24,679
we go through this magic um and we ask

1901
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:25,760
will it help this patient right luky for

1902
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:27,719
example

1903
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,719
um can we treat all the patients within

1904
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:32,480
a particular disease or however you want

1905
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:34,400
to look at it um the answer may be no

1906
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,679
but you can treat some of them in one

1907
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,600
way and you have to find something else

1908
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,639
for the others are there better

1909
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,320
treatments so repurposing might be a

1910
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:43,600
great place to start we agree um but

1911
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,960
we're also developing new drugs that are

1912
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,320
now tailored to the the mechanisms and

1913
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:51,280
targets that we

1914
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:52,760
discover um and one thing I mention want

1915
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,480
to mention is that also looking at the

1916
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,280
adverse side of it right so you make all

1917
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,440
these mole ules one of the biggest

1918
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,719
drivers of costs are all the failures

1919
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:02,280
toxicities lack of efficacy and all that

1920
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,159
but toxicities are you know put patients

1921
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:07,480
at risk and are just bad business so

1922
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:09,360
just you know there's no reason to uh to

1923
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,920
not avoid that if you can and so we see

1924
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:14,000
all of that um in in in a pretty clear

1925
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,600
way so we bring this function first

1926
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,520
approach to drug Discovery and we have

1927
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,639
these three components one is bav and

1928
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,600
it's really this Google Maps for health

1929
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:25,040
um this network biology of human health

1930
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,360
coupled with an insilico compound

1931
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,639
Library about 40,000 molecules now all

1932
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,920
these are purchasable you could say this

1933
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:33,840
is repurposing to us they're Discovery

1934
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:36,400
tools and over time families and

1935
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,840
Foundations like the ctdk sunshine

1936
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,600
Foundation came to us and ask can we

1937
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,120
just use those tools for the ones that

1938
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,920
are actually approved for patients the

1939
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,679
answer is yeah we're not a repurposing

1940
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:47,120
company but we're trying to probe the

1941
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:48,480
complexities using these molecules um

1942
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,159
one thing that we do as an intermediate

1943
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,159
step we developed this concept of

1944
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:54,400
squishy wear it's not hard it's not soft

1945
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:56,840
it's squishy these are tadpoles they are

1946
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,760
actually very squishy um and we can do

1947
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:01,040
sort of kind computer vision type

1948
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,400
analysis like again with with the cells

1949
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,199
that you saw earlier but with living

1950
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,920
moving tadpoles that are again mutated

1951
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:08,840
with the various genes and we can just

1952
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,000
ask does it help that rescue that model

1953
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,840
but then really where we're at again

1954
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,199
it's patient driven and patient focused

1955
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,920
uh drug development are the clinical

1956
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,280
studies does it actually work in a

1957
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,040
patient and so what we do we use

1958
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:20,280
existing drugs to ask that question

1959
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:22,600
because you could administer those today

1960
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:24,480
not in 10 years right with potential

1961
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,080
other toxicities and other things yes

1962
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,920
they may not be ideal they may not get

1963
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,120
you the 100% of the efficacy you're

1964
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,040
after but if you can get 50% one it

1965
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:34,159
proves out your mechanism that you can

1966
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:38,320
now invest the the resources for a New

1967
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:39,960
Drug um and it might help patients today

1968
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,840
in the meantime right you don't have to

1969
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,360
wait 10 years for the perfect drug and

1970
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,199
have nothing you might have an

1971
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:49,400
intermediate step in between and so does

1972
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:51,480
it work well uh yes it works even to our

1973
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,920
surprise quite well um we've actually

1974
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,480
shown this actually during the lovely

1975
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,320
pandemic that we had a few years ago we

1976
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,480
showed that we can predict the function

1977
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:02,280
uh of specific statins in this case so

1978
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:04,560
used for cholesterol control um you

1979
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,920
predict specific Statin impact on

1980
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,800
Survival from covid so these are

1981
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,080
patients who are getting statins because

1982
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,120
of their hyper lipidemia anyway and we

1983
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,000
showed that specific molecules but not

1984
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,440
the class as a whole were actually

1985
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,960
therapeutic and this was death as an

1986
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,960
endpoint so pretty pretty cut and dry in

1987
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:21,639
terms of outcomes and we were

1988
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,440
statistically significant um actually um

1989
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:26,199
we had a false negative which is a good

1990
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:28,000
one to have uh but overall much better

1991
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:30,560
than your your 2% success rate we had an

1992
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,080
80% success rate in predicting clinical

1993
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,360
outcomes and so part of the challenge

1994
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,600
here is really this infrastructure and

1995
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,639
how do you work with patient groups how

1996
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,040
do you partner and I mentioned that

1997
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:40,360
famili started coming to us and so we

1998
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,120
actually had to develop a new business

1999
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,840
model and we set aside the one that we

2000
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,800
started out with you know about four

2001
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,880
years ago before spinning out and we

2002
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,199
said you know we really need to offer

2003
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,159
these Services even though we are not a

2004
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,040
service company and we're not a

2005
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,960
repurposing company and so we started

2006
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,360
the rare shift uh service platform and

2007
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,840
really this is just sort of cost based

2008
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:01,360
drug Discovery for nonprofits um it's

2009
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,120
ri.org and and there it is drug

2010
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,280
repurposing that is the goal that is

2011
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,199
that is the message that is the goal for

2012
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,199
us it's a stepping stone towards the

2013
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:11,600
novel drug arm essentially provides

2014
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:13,440
clinical Discovery and validation and

2015
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,040
then the Partnerships build in the

2016
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:17,159
process and we become a partner to the

2017
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,080
foundations or the families um and they

2018
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:20,400
become our partners in the in the

2019
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,159
discovery and validation process so it

2020
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,840
becomes a win-win um and what we've been

2021
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:27,679
able to do is actually using nasal swab

2022
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,120
so again before the pandemic this would

2023
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:32,159
not have been possible uh to collect a

2024
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:34,480
few cells on on a covid test kit

2025
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:36,920
essentially um and use that to extract

2026
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,719
RNA run it through our biona platform

2027
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,960
and get insights on the brain because

2028
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,400
most of what we work on our neurological

2029
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,960
diseases and then we can use this AI

2030
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,800
platform to figure out how do we uh

2031
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,360
potentially fix this patient what's

2032
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:52,159
going on how is patient one different or

2033
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:53,320
or the same as patient 2 and and so on

2034
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,880
and what's really exciting we can work

2035
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,280
all around the world um so we've

2036
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,639
actually sampled patients from the

2037
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:01,320
remote Outback took 5 weeks but we did

2038
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:03,880
it um we can basically ship these kits

2039
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:07,120
all around the world at room temperature

2040
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:10,480
um and so what we have started to do is

2041
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:13,159
see the the evolution of these diseases

2042
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,679
into truly what we call Therapeutic

2043
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:16,560
response groups it's not about how you

2044
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:17,880
got there it's how you fix things right

2045
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,600
and so that's where these trgs

2046
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,120
therapeutic response groups come in and

2047
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,600
so this is actually s Gap one is another

2048
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:25,080
one of these neurological

2049
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:28,120
disorders if you take a look at at this

2050
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,400
rainbow Matrix um there is no pattern we

2051
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,639
tried there's there's nothing really

2052
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:34,239
clear different ages different mutation

2053
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:36,080
sites genotype phenotype doesn't really

2054
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:39,159
exist but what we start seeing in terms

2055
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,560
of drug response are three groups and

2056
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:42,520
they actually correlate really

2057
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,639
beautifully and those patients are

2058
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,080
actually quite different from each other

2059
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:46,440
once you look at them from that

2060
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,800
perspective and so now we're trying to

2061
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:50,440
take these really complex populations

2062
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,199
and and reduce them to something more

2063
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:54,920
manageable and so just to show what

2064
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:57,320
we've been able to do on the the

2065
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,440
biofarma side of our company we work on

2066
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,000
red syndrome it's again one of these

2067
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,800
neurological neurogenetic disorders one

2068
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,760
of the more common ones this is not rare

2069
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,920
and there actually there's been one

2070
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:07,440
approved drug on the market um and we

2071
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,320
actually use that as a benchmark and we

2072
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,199
basically did the same process collect

2073
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,560
data from patients and from other

2074
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,120
sources uh run it through our platform

2075
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,120
here's actually the mutation but we

2076
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,800
found a Target somewhere else doesn't

2077
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,639
matter what caused it but if you can

2078
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:23,679
engage this target right there right um

2079
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:25,080
how we got there is is is the magic but

2080
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,760
we we show that if you can as you engage

2081
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,880
that Target right there it fixes the

2082
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,120
network and that was the real insight

2083
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,800
and so now we actually have a new drug

2084
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,400
for this but we're not going to develop

2085
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,239
it until we show that this works with an

2086
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:37,199
existing drug because that's how we can

2087
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:40,360
test it today by the way the existing

2088
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:42,560
drug veristat um formulation in in Ravel

2089
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:44,320
one outperforms the one that's currently

2090
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,239
on the market dramatically especially in

2091
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,840
the later stag of the disease and we're

2092
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:50,199
starting two clinical trials in red

2093
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,480
syndrome um and then you might may ask

2094
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:53,719
does it actually work well this is the

2095
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:55,440
beauty of using existing drugs there's

2096
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:57,080
actually a family with a boy with red

2097
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,520
syndrome boys are really rare they tend

2098
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:02,960
to not do very well uh with this disease

2099
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,280
and um they were you know really looking

2100
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,120
for options their clinician was looking

2101
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:08,639
for options and so uh long story short

2102
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,440
we identified vernat actually to work

2103
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,560
for that patient uh computationally and

2104
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,920
the clinician felt that it was

2105
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,639
appropriate for her to prescribe it to

2106
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,280
the patient and uh sure enough have

2107
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,239
extremely low Doses and this is a cancer

2108
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:23,679
drug right so keep in mind this is not a

2109
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:25,080
supplement um the Sleep Quality improved

2110
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:27,120
pretty dramatically normalized blood

2111
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,199
metrics is an objective measure of of

2112
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,880
improvement um and then improved motor

2113
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:34,159
and cognitive function as assessed by

2114
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:36,080
various uh clinical uh professionals um

2115
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:37,840
and now we're actually um the boy still

2116
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,560
on it this is he been for over a year at

2117
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,639
this point continues to improve and

2118
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,840
we're actually layering additional uh

2119
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:46,400
therapies on top of that um I mean the

2120
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,679
clinician is but but uh with our

2121
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,360
data and what we're doing now this was

2122
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:52,679
really exciting to us saying look this

2123
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:55,400
really can can help even reverse this

2124
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:57,480
extremely severe case um

2125
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,800
we're actually starting two clinical

2126
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,480
studies one in red syndrome um in

2127
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,400
Colombia so I joke that we're bringing

2128
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:06,840
white powder to Colombia for a change um

2129
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:09,400
and uh it's it's a really fantastic

2130
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,840
place we go to where the patients are um

2131
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,679
there are 15 patients all being treated

2132
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:16,040
by a single clinician single sight study

2133
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:18,000
really fantastic uh place and they have

2134
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:20,000
never been able to participate in

2135
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,400
Cutting Edge research like this and so

2136
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,880
this is this is what we're doing doing

2137
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,719
we're actually using oral liquid

2138
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,719
veristat validating our Target right now

2139
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:28,719
there's a repurposed candidate um we

2140
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:30,120
potentially we have orphan drug

2141
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,679
designation for it in the US we will

2142
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:34,400
bring it to the US uh we also continue

2143
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:36,199
with it in Latin America but then we're

2144
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,560
actually building Ravel 2 which is this

2145
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:40,920
new optimized drug specifically for rat

2146
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,639
syndrome and several other diseases um

2147
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,280
but that we ask the critical question

2148
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,920
does it work before we commit tens of

2149
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,000
millions of dollars to developing a new

2150
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,960
drug and it gets even better so the

2151
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,199
question is you know there's 15,000 rare

2152
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,719
diseases or whatever the number is a

2153
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:56,639
really big number um how do we tackle

2154
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,800
not one at a time but how do we paralyze

2155
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,480
it and so we've actually identified

2156
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,679
these therapeutic response groups to

2157
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,400
span diagnosis so there's pit Hopkin

2158
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:07,520
syndrome which is not R syndrome it's a

2159
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:09,480
different Gene different disease uh with

2160
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,800
some you know similarities but they're

2161
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,000
actually sponsoring clinical study

2162
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,480
because we predicted that it would

2163
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,120
actually be quite effective predicted

2164
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,080
that it would work in mice lo and behold

2165
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,239
it worked in mice so now we have to go

2166
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:21,360
to patients that's the only way to

2167
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:23,000
answer that question um and overall we

2168
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,560
have about 50 different diseases in our

2169
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,040
portfolio

2170
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:30,040
um as you can see um they they usually

2171
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:32,239
start with this bav screen some of them

2172
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:34,120
have tadpole models that get developed

2173
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,360
um some don't some have Mouse models

2174
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:38,080
that get developed some don't we work

2175
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,440
with Jackson Labs as well um where

2176
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,360
people are really headed is is the

2177
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,040
clinical part right does it work in

2178
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,560
actual patients I mean that's that's the

2179
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,199
ultimate question and so all these are

2180
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,639
off label I should I should note that we

2181
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:49,040
do not treat patients but we can we

2182
01:24:47,639 --> 01:24:51,040
generate research use data that could be

2183
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:54,119
used for clinicians to evaluate as as

2184
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:55,679
they see fit um one thing I want to

2185
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:57,679
announce here today so we actually have

2186
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:01,239
not announced this yet so this is the

2187
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:03,159
first time um we just signed a very key

2188
01:25:01,239 --> 01:25:05,400
uh agreement with combined brain so so

2189
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:06,840
Nathan and aah mentioned them um they're

2190
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:10,080
an umbrella organization that really

2191
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:12,760
spans about 120 different different um

2192
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,639
patient advocacy groups encompassing um

2193
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,920
a little bit more diseases than that

2194
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,040
some of them have actually more than one

2195
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,320
falling under them um and essentially

2196
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:22,159
what we're doing is taking our uh really

2197
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,840
Patient First approach RNA driven

2198
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:25,400
approach and applying it to not just the

2199
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,679
50 dis orders that we already work with

2200
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:30,880
but another 120 right so this represents

2201
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,679
really a landmark uh partnering in the

2202
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,520
space rare disease most of these are

2203
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:37,159
ultra rare diseases Ultra ultra rare I

2204
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:39,199
mean one one group has uh six patients

2205
01:25:37,159 --> 01:25:41,600
documented right so these are talk about

2206
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,840
a challenge of of scaling to commercial

2207
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,320
uh opportunities um and this is the type

2208
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,360
of partnering that I think we envisioned

2209
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,679
that we thanks to all these fantastic

2210
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:51,040
patient advocacy groups um are are

2211
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:53,880
really trying to change how we how we do

2212
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:56,440
drug development so with that want to

2213
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,950
thank you for your your time and um

2214
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:06,779
again drug development driven by

2215
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:06,779
[Applause]

2216
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:16,199
patients thank you wonderful talk so you

2217
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:19,040
mentioned the powerful pipeline biona

2218
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:22,040
for clinical usage so can you comment

2219
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:24,840
the current practice in regulations of

2220
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:27,199
FDA how can you to meet with

2221
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:30,000
da regulations and then you talk about

2222
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:33,159
the clinic Trail in Colombia is a a

2223
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,199
possible solution to navigate the RDA

2224
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:38,000
regulations yep y yeah so the the

2225
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:40,360
regulatory aspects are definitely key um

2226
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,679
we'll again it's a very right now last

2227
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,480
few last month or so has been very

2228
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,119
dynamic in that space so we'll see how

2229
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:47,520
it plays out but I'm sure it will I'm

2230
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:50,440
sure it'll it'll you know stabilize um

2231
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,960
so that caveat aside um absolutely key

2232
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:55,040
to engage with FDA early and often um we

2233
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,280
have we filed a pre in the US before we

2234
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,239
went to Columbia we want to make sure

2235
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:00,600
the FDA agreed generally not necessarily

2236
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:03,119
to some of the specific details that are

2237
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:05,199
more country or regulator specific but

2238
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:07,800
would this make sense right before we go

2239
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:10,280
to where it's faster cheaper easier to

2240
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:12,400
do a a trial um the regulation actually

2241
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,800
in Columbia is very similar to the US um

2242
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,119
but the patients are there the cost of

2243
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,520
doing the trials is just a fraction of

2244
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,639
that in the US as you might imagine

2245
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:23,760
right um so absolutely uh key to to

2246
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:26,719
engage with FDA bav we have no vision

2247
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,840
for that to be a clinical tool to us

2248
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:29,360
it's a discovery tool because the

2249
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,520
regulatory challenges dealing with these

2250
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:34,199
networks I don't think are possible to

2251
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,679
overcome just given how the FDA

2252
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:38,000
regulates

2253
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:40,199
Diagnostics um that said what comes out

2254
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,960
of it is a drug we can regulate the

2255
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:43,760
drugs and and and we can be absolutely

2256
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,480
compliant with that and and do so in a

2257
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,400
very efficient way that's also where

2258
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:49,280
repurpose drugs are have an advantage

2259
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,199
because a lot of the safety the main

2260
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,639
safety concerns are addressed now the

2261
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,719
question is is it safe in this

2262
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,960
population but you sort of know what to

2263
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,320
look for is it kidney toxicity liver

2264
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,040
toxicity you you have a better idea of

2265
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,480
what what to look for so it's it tends

2266
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,520
to accelerate the whole process and

2267
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:06,760
reduce costs but the regulator

2268
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:10,880
regulatory aspect is is really key to to

2269
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:13,480
bring in early yeah thank you thank

2270
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:16,600
you I uh I think it's amazing that

2271
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:17,600
you're able to uh actually develop a

2272
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,360
therapeutic for so many different

2273
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,920
diseases but how do you actually on the

2274
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,440
actual biotech company prioritize which

2275
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,639
diseases to actually pursue the clinical

2276
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:27,239
trials for

2277
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,960
yeah that's a great question um this is

2278
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:31,280
where being in rare actually has its

2279
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,400
advantages um so orphan drug designation

2280
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:35,719
gives you priority review it reduces the

2281
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,639
time for review it it uh eliminates a

2282
01:28:35,719 --> 01:28:39,800
lot of the fees that Pharma typically

2283
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:42,239
has to pay so you have all those

2284
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:44,480
benefits to your your um you know to

2285
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:47,560
advocate for it now which one of these

2286
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:49,360
rare diseases within the rare space um

2287
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:52,560
this is where it's a partnership right

2288
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:54,760
and as with any partnership some are way

2289
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,840
more Dynamic and and F fast and others

2290
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,679
are are more slow and there are

2291
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,800
different priorities that the the

2292
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:01,880
different patient advocacy groups have

2293
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:04,400
that may or may not directly align with

2294
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:06,760
the given trajectory at any one time and

2295
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:08,400
so it's it's a a group decision of like

2296
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,840
what what makes the most sense and it

2297
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,639
may be that you pick one for example

2298
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,040
with ret syndrome um you know I think

2299
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,280
we're more likely to get investor

2300
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:18,679
interest for a US trial for R syndrome

2301
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:20,920
versus um one of the subgroups that we

2302
01:29:18,679 --> 01:29:22,760
found already has 40 patients Nation

2303
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:24,679
globally probably not a good thing for

2304
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,520
investors to for

2305
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:29,040
that said they may be a really good

2306
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,719
opportunity for getting um EU approval

2307
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,719
for that drug because once the drug is

2308
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,320
approved in a given country you can

2309
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,199
start selling it and clinicians can

2310
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,960
start prescribing it off label right and

2311
01:29:36,199 --> 01:29:40,840
so especially for Ravel 2 that new drug

2312
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,920
may actually could go through this 40

2313
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:45,920
Patient Group much faster in a five

2314
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:48,080
person study and so like the commercial

2315
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,440
and the approval side are are not always

2316
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,840
as aligned as they are for large

2317
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:54,560
diseases

2318
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:57,280
iig yeah yeah actually

2319
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,920
just to pick up on this theme have you

2320
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:02,760
considered doing basket trials is that

2321
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:07,520
something that would be open to

2322
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:10,199
absolutely um so we like it um talk to

2323
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:13,119
your neighborhood regulator about

2324
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:15,159
it um in fact in Colombia we we propose

2325
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:16,800
that they do not on principle allow

2326
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:18,880
basket trial so we're doing two separate

2327
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,880
inds two separate everything even though

2328
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,719
it's more copy and paste for for all the

2329
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,880
documents um we'll do that if at least

2330
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:27,400
at the beginning hopefully that'll

2331
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:29,040
evolve as as these these um these things

2332
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,239
change and this will also be a factor of

2333
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,320
the the patient advocacy groups

2334
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:33,760
advocating hey there's no way we can do

2335
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,119
our own trial but can we have three

2336
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,719
patients in this trial right um so I

2337
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:41,520
think that will be kind of two-way

2338
01:30:37,719 --> 01:30:44,199
street there that said in the US um the

2339
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,119
US is open to that the US FDA um it has

2340
01:30:44,199 --> 01:30:48,080
its own set of challenges uh but

2341
01:30:46,119 --> 01:30:51,670
absolutely there's lots of

2342
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:55,440
precedent yeah great thank you thank you

2343
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:57,280
[Applause]

2344
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,600
that was remarkable basket trials

2345
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:01,560
remember that because um all of our

2346
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,880
efforts in noal biology will ultimately

2347
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,199
be served by you know being able to use

2348
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,199
the same medication for patients with

2349
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:10,040
multiple different genetic misspellings

2350
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:11,719
that seem to converge on a biological

2351
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:13,679
node that can be targeted that's exactly

2352
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:15,920
what we hope to accomplish so this is an

2353
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,159
important uh point that was made so I'm

2354
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,800
I'm glad that it was made it's been

2355
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:21,639
successful in cancer and the US FDA is

2356
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,280
open to it so we have to all Advocate as

2357
01:31:21,639 --> 01:31:25,280
a community for this structure to be

2358
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:27,760
utilized for rare diseases and to also

2359
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:32,040
provide examples where that uh can

2360
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:34,920
happen speaking of the future and um you

2361
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,080
know people working uh within the

2362
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,400
context of the latter secures

2363
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,639
accelerator and the broader broad

2364
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:43,080
Community uh toward that uh incredible

2365
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:45,320
future and um maybe also building on um

2366
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:48,080
Harvey lish's incredible suggestion

2367
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:49,960
about identifying ways in which you can

2368
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,960
increase the activity of certain genes

2369
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,639
and how you might be able to

2370
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:55,960
systematically do that I'm wildly proud

2371
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:58,440
to to introduce um Arya raal who is an

2372
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:59,840
mdphd student here at Broad working in

2373
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:02,040
the Laboratories of two incredible

2374
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:04,360
physician scientists and colleagues uh p

2375
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:07,040
saetti and Sangita baa and she's going

2376
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:08,840
to tell you about her work uh harnessing

2377
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,040
Evolution to try to understand how we

2378
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:13,320
can uh regulate genan so Arya take it

2379
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,600
away thank you so much Anna um and it's

2380
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,880
great to be here with you all this is

2381
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,719
such an amazing community and I'm

2382
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,360
fortunate to be a part of it um so thank

2383
01:32:17,719 --> 01:32:21,239
you to the Tamir foundation and a big

2384
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,520
shout out to Julian for all of her help

2385
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:24,920
uh today and and in general uh I'm

2386
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,480
excited today to share with you in

2387
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:28,760
particular my vision for the next

2388
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,440
generation of rare disease Therapeutics

2389
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:32,480
and how we can achieve it with insights

2390
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:35,520
from evolutionary

2391
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:40,560
biology Back to Basics our genetic code

2392
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:42,800
is made up of four simple letters a c t

2393
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,600
g so with different combinations of

2394
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,960
these bases our genomes are able to

2395
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:49,800
execute this huge number of functions

2396
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:51,800
necessary to make our body's work this

2397
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,760
is the language that Evolution has used

2398
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:56,840
to sculpt our intricate human physiology

2399
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,320
but it turns out that Evolution has a

2400
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,480
really narrow

2401
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:04,560
vocabulary the human genome is 300 or

2402
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:06,360
sorry three billion base pairs long and

2403
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,920
so if we do the math there are four

2404
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,159
possible bases that we can have at each

2405
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,880
of those three billion positions which

2406
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:14,800
means this for a genome of our size

2407
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,719
there are four to the three billionth

2408
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,400
possible

2409
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:19,719
configurations that's more than the

2410
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:22,199
number of atoms in the observable

2411
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:24,440
universe but less than 1% of these have

2412
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:26,040
been explored by Natural Evolution

2413
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:28,119
so what's going on with all of that

2414
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:30,960
missing

2415
01:33:28,119 --> 01:33:33,199
code Evolution works with two main

2416
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:35,280
forces mutation and

2417
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:36,960
selection as our cells divide throughout

2418
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:39,199
our lifetimes our genomes are copied

2419
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,719
over errors are sometimes made in this

2420
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:44,360
process called mutations mutations that

2421
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:46,159
are beneficial are selected for these

2422
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:48,080
rise to high frequency and then are

2423
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:50,840
passed on from generation to

2424
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:52,719
generation we can imagine Evolution like

2425
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,320
a hiker who's going through this big

2426
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,639
mountain range

2427
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:59,280
each step that the hiker takes is a

2428
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,800
mutation a beneficial mutation is a step

2429
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,119
forward closer to the top of the

2430
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,920
mountain whereas a harmful mutation is a

2431
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:07,960
step back down the slope here's the

2432
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,760
problem though our hiker from where

2433
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,280
they're standing in the mountain range

2434
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,719
does not know whether the path that

2435
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:15,080
they're on is the path that will take

2436
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,400
them to the tallest peak and so it's

2437
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:18,280
easy for them to get stuck on a

2438
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,800
suboptimal peak because from where

2439
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,040
they're standing they don't know what's

2440
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:24,040
up what's down where to

2441
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:25,960
go it's for this reason Reon that

2442
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,840
Evolution has only explored a tiny

2443
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:30,080
portion of our mountain range which

2444
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,159
we'll call sequence space but there are

2445
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:35,159
still many many Peaks to be found in the

2446
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:35,159
sequence space that's been

2447
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,880
unexplored synthetic DNA DNA that's

2448
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,199
explored from this Uncharted Territory

2449
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,159
may have useful therapeutic

2450
01:34:42,199 --> 01:34:46,840
functionality we can explore the rest of

2451
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:49,239
the Peaks to get

2452
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:51,360
there while I was a medical student on

2453
01:34:49,239 --> 01:34:53,159
the Ws at Mass General across the river

2454
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:55,679
I was really fortunate to work directly

2455
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:57,800
with some amazing Ry disease patients uh

2456
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,320
and their families and something that

2457
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:02,320
struck me during this process was this

2458
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,199
if we were more able to precisely Target

2459
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:06,639
the affected cells in these patients and

2460
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:09,080
the cell types specifically we could

2461
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:11,600
have more effective Therapeutics in

2462
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:14,119
general most of our genomes in fact are

2463
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,600
conf composed of regulatory DNA this is

2464
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:17,600
DNA that tells genes where and when to

2465
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,560
be

2466
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:24,040
expressed uh CIS regulatory elements or

2467
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:26,840
cres are one type of this DNA uh and

2468
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:29,159
they can act like a genetic dial so if

2469
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,760
we tune this dial we can obtain

2470
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:33,080
different Crees that lead to different

2471
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:35,560
levels of gene expression in different

2472
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:38,119
tissues so if we learn the rules of that

2473
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:40,000
regulatory grammar and build around them

2474
01:35:38,119 --> 01:35:42,280
we can find the peaks of new mountains

2475
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,960
and thereby generate a whole new world

2476
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:47,000
of therapies we could engineer our DNA

2477
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:49,199
for any number of functions things like

2478
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,159
Hier gene expression greater cell type

2479
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:55,639
specificity greater tunability and so on

2480
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:57,280
achieving this vision for rare disease

2481
01:35:55,639 --> 01:35:59,679
Therapeutics of course requires the

2482
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:01,880
right team and as Anna alluded to I'm

2483
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,199
pretty fortunate to have a great one

2484
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,400
there are two major elements to

2485
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:08,280
achieving this next generation of rare

2486
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:10,239
disease Therapeutics uh one is designing

2487
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:12,639
the right cres and the second is getting

2488
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:14,520
them to where they need to go delivery

2489
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:17,800
and so in pursuit of these I joined the

2490
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:20,280
cetti lab and the baa lab partisan Anda

2491
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,199
are two extremely intelligent and

2492
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,320
wonderful and kind mentors I'm very

2493
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:26,080
lucky to work with them paris's

2494
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,320
expertise is in computational genomics

2495
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,679
and Sangita Works in nanotechnologies

2496
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,159
and so these are the two areas that we

2497
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:35,440
need to bring together to make this

2498
01:36:33,159 --> 01:36:37,040
happen and so in the cetti lab we've

2499
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:39,040
come up with a way to rise up the

2500
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:41,000
metaphorical mountains I told you about

2501
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:42,840
to design new regulatory elements that

2502
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,440
can design in unprecedent that can work

2503
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,159
in unprecedented ways we use an

2504
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:50,239
experiment called a massively parallel

2505
01:36:47,159 --> 01:36:53,000
reporter assay or an MPR uh to test

2506
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:54,719
hundreds of thousands of CES at once

2507
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,679
this allows to describe the genome's

2508
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:58,400
regulatory code and its grammar

2509
01:36:56,679 --> 01:37:00,320
empirically and then we can use

2510
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,360
computational tools to learn those rules

2511
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,960
more precisely and then design new

2512
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:05,760
sequences that work even better than the

2513
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:07,800
old

2514
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,360
ones we can dive a little bit more

2515
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,960
closely into this approach uh first we

2516
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:14,320
start with the experimental end this

2517
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,760
massively parallel reporter essay we

2518
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:19,199
take a starting DNA library of

2519
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:21,880
cres we can tag on a fluorescent

2520
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:24,239
reporter Gene onto these CES and then

2521
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:26,000
transfect that into cell lines

2522
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:28,400
and so the level of expression of our

2523
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,239
reporter Gene in each cell line tells us

2524
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:33,760
how effective that CR is in that

2525
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:35,719
context so from these experiments we can

2526
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,960
generate numerical activity scores for

2527
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:39,840
different cres in different cell types

2528
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:43,639
in this example I'm showing you we have

2529
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,639
liver brain and

2530
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:50,360
blood in the new age of high performance

2531
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,840
Computing we can now use those massive

2532
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:54,880
amounts of experimental data that we've

2533
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,520
collected to explicitly learn the rules

2534
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,920
of regulatory

2535
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:00,880
grammar these models can hone in on what

2536
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:03,840
parts of DNA sequences contribute to CR

2537
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,480
reactivity cell type specificity Etc and

2538
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,280
so we can begin to answer questions of

2539
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,920
why a certain C is more active in one

2540
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:11,360
cell than another and more broadly where

2541
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,440
and how we might gain functional

2542
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,159
advantages in our cres by modifying

2543
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,239
their

2544
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:18,400
sequences so this predictive machine

2545
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:20,119
learning model essentially gives us a

2546
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,800
bird's eye view of the mountain range

2547
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:23,920
that we

2548
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:25,480
discussed so this is the understanding

2549
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,480
that we use to fuel computational

2550
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:30,280
exploration of the remaining sequence

2551
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:33,159
space with our predictive map in hand we

2552
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:35,239
can guide generative AI models to design

2553
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:36,920
cres with the highest reach possible in

2554
01:38:35,239 --> 01:38:39,639
these mountains engineering for many

2555
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:42,239
many desired functions here's how this

2556
01:38:39,639 --> 01:38:44,119
works we start with sequences of unknown

2557
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:46,599
activity typically random

2558
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:48,400
sequences these sequences are passed to

2559
01:38:46,599 --> 01:38:49,840
our predictive machine learning model

2560
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:52,000
which obtains a baseline measure of

2561
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:54,760
their predicted

2562
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,360
activity we can then then use a function

2563
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:59,400
which looks at the whole overall

2564
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:02,639
sequence space finds the Peaks and then

2565
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:05,480
Tunes the sequences as it goes to reach

2566
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:07,280
them and thereby we obtain sequences

2567
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,599
with the maximum desired function of

2568
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:11,400
whatever we're looking for and this is

2569
01:39:09,599 --> 01:39:12,840
an iterative cycle we can then test

2570
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:16,679
those sequences that we've designed with

2571
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:16,679
MP again and it starts all

2572
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:20,560
over fortunately when we test these

2573
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,080
computationally designed cres we see

2574
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,560
some really promising results and there

2575
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:25,719
are lots of examples I could go through

2576
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,719
but I think this is the most striking uh

2577
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:29,480
this is a neuronal CR that we designed

2578
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:31,440
with this pipeline that we then

2579
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:33,040
expressed in an embryonic Mouse and

2580
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:35,040
early on in development you can see that

2581
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:37,440
there's a little bit of blue expression

2582
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,880
in what looks like the brain so a couple

2583
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:41,560
of weeks post natal we did dissection

2584
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:43,080
and see that our enhancer not only

2585
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:45,239
expresses specifically in the brain and

2586
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:48,199
not anywhere else but localizes to the

2587
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:50,280
cortex a specific anatomical region and

2588
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:52,320
as any neurobiologists in the room know

2589
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,599
cell types in the brain can be tricky so

2590
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,920
we're very fortunate to have these

2591
01:39:53,599 --> 01:39:57,199
results and overall we're really excited

2592
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,119
that our model is able to build

2593
01:39:57,199 --> 01:40:01,360
completely synthetic short regulatory

2594
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:03,639
sequences that can drive really tissue

2595
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:05,880
specific expression but we have a lot of

2596
01:40:03,639 --> 01:40:07,480
work ahead of us to extend our models to

2597
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:10,119
additional cell types and most

2598
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:11,920
importantly to therapeutic

2599
01:40:10,119 --> 01:40:13,560
applications and so with the support of

2600
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,679
the ladder secures initiative we're now

2601
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,679
working to extend these findings to

2602
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,800
novel cures and rare diseases and

2603
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,400
specifically uh in muscle cell types of

2604
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,960
skeletal smooth and cardiac muscle uh we

2605
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,679
think these cell types are interesting

2606
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:27,800
because they have similar contractile

2607
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,560
functionality and similar embryonic

2608
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,520
Origins but they function in really

2609
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:33,679
different ways and have so many diseases

2610
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,159
that affect them and so this is a one

2611
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:38,320
node that we think we can

2612
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:39,840
Target to close I'll just tell you about

2613
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,599
a few of the ways that we're tackling

2614
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,960
this in muscle um and the ways that we

2615
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:45,840
think a multi- disease approach uh using

2616
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:48,560
these cres can achieve big outcomes in

2617
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:51,360
rare disease uh the first is in disent

2618
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:53,639
muscular distrophy or DMD DMD is a hot

2619
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:56,199
topic for a rare disease community it's

2620
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:57,840
caused by mutation in the disten gene uh

2621
01:40:56,199 --> 01:40:59,400
and it has devastating effects on

2622
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,080
muscular tissue which then cause

2623
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:03,679
devastating systemic symptoms Gene

2624
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:06,159
therapies are emerging on the market

2625
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:08,239
right now uh which aim to deliver normal

2626
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:10,679
distri to damage tissues or edit native

2627
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:12,560
genomes directly but one key concern

2628
01:41:10,679 --> 01:41:14,679
with all of these is off Target effects

2629
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:17,159
many of which I've put up on the slide

2630
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:18,800
here and so we need to ensure that our

2631
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:21,080
genetic products are only expressed

2632
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,760
where they're needed that is offt Target

2633
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:25,159
effects are minimized and so we think

2634
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:27,000
that our cres could prove useful in this

2635
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:28,960
setting and so by combining our muscle

2636
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,639
specific cres with muscle specific

2637
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,560
delivery vectors or just using our Crees

2638
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:35,840
with a standard delivery Vector uh we

2639
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:38,000
could achieve some pretty interesting

2640
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,560
results and the second is thinking more

2641
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,119
broadly about what kinds of disease

2642
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:43,560
cases these cres might be useful in um

2643
01:41:42,119 --> 01:41:44,840
as I think towards being a physician

2644
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:46,280
scientist I'm always thinking about the

2645
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,800
patients first and I really appreciated

2646
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:50,320
Richard's approach to that um one of the

2647
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,000
diseases I think would be really

2648
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,960
interesting to Target here is hereditary

2649
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,560
hemorrhagic t inasia

2650
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:59,480
hht and now hht is a disease that

2651
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:01,520
affects one in 6,000 people um it is

2652
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,400
caused by a structural defect in a

2653
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,360
protein called endoglin and endoglin

2654
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,960
help endoglin helps support our blood

2655
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:10,040
vessels and keeps that structural

2656
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:12,719
Integrity uh these mutations can cause

2657
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:14,360
some really devastating complications uh

2658
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,679
by losing structural Integrity of the

2659
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,400
blood vessels you can get things like

2660
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:21,400
stroke anemia heart failure Hemorrhage

2661
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,679
um and it's utmost important to tr to

2662
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,679
try and prevent these but there's no

2663
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:26,400
cure right

2664
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:29,119
now the therapy here is deceptively

2665
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:31,639
simple if we can upregulate endoglin

2666
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:34,239
only in the cells where we need to then

2667
01:42:31,639 --> 01:42:36,520
we could prevent these complications uh

2668
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:38,520
and so we're really excited to continue

2669
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:40,760
work towards that

2670
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:43,239
direction and so to finish off I'd like

2671
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,440
to bring us back to where we started uh

2672
01:42:43,239 --> 01:42:46,880
there is so much to be explored uh in

2673
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,679
the sequence space we haven't covered

2674
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,840
yet there are so many mountains left to

2675
01:42:48,679 --> 01:42:54,040
climb and so if we combine highr

2676
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,520
experimentation which the bro so good at

2677
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:57,520
with computational modeling that's being

2678
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,440
enabled by all the latest advances in Ai

2679
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,199
and machine learning uh we can get to

2680
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:03,679
those next Peaks and achieve this next

2681
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:04,920
generation of rad disease Therapeutics

2682
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:08,280
um and so thank you so much for your

2683
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:08,280
time happy to answer any

2684
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:18,320
[Applause]

2685
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:20,719
questions thank you wonderful talk so

2686
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:23,560
can you comment the pros and cons of the

2687
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:26,760
no world DN sequence targeting cie and

2688
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:29,159
compare with current nucleic acid

2689
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:31,480
medicine sorry uh so to rephrase the

2690
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:33,920
question comparing current cres used in

2691
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:36,800
gene therapies as compared to our new

2692
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:40,400
ones like a current practice using R

2693
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:43,040
medicine or D or P other a lot of

2694
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:44,840
nuclear acid based medicine so can you

2695
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,840
compare your methodology with current

2696
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:48,440
practice I think the beauty of this is

2697
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:50,760
that you can do it all together right so

2698
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:52,679
we're generating elements that can

2699
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:54,199
upregulate the expression of DNA or the

2700
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:55,840
expression of genes and so these can be

2701
01:43:54,199 --> 01:43:57,520
used in combination with existing Gene

2702
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,040
therapies or can be used to drive their

2703
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,080
own and so we sort of view this as a

2704
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:04,440
platform as opposed to a competitor here

2705
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,440
thank you

2706
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:10,639
yeah Arya do you recall a specific um

2707
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:13,199
experience in the clinic or a patient

2708
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:15,119
who uh inspired you to go into this work

2709
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:17,199
you know I can think of so many but I

2710
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:18,599
think uh one of the ones that really

2711
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:20,599
stuck with me is when I was a first year

2712
01:44:18,599 --> 01:44:22,440
medical student I rotated um on the

2713
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:23,920
Pediatric paliative Care awards at

2714
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:26,360
Boston children

2715
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,159
uh and there I I was um working with

2716
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:30,159
this one patient who had a a very rare

2717
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:32,159
muscular disease that caused constant

2718
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:33,800
contraction and and that was the moment

2719
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:34,960
where I realized that the work that I

2720
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:37,080
had been doing in the lab which I

2721
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,920
actually started prior to my clinical

2722
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:42,239
rotations had a really direct impact um

2723
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:45,280
his family was just so amazing and the

2724
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:46,800
care team uh was so dedicated to the

2725
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:49,400
whole disease process trying to find

2726
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,199
cures trying to find options that would

2727
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,119
alleviate symptoms and more importantly

2728
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:54,800
emotional emotional well-being and and

2729
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:56,880
so this is sort of the picture that

2730
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,599
brought me together and so this is

2731
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,880
something I got to work on um so thank

2732
01:44:58,599 --> 01:45:05,080
you for the opportunity absolutely thank

2733
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:07,920
you so much question question and how

2734
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:10,960
large are these this is an excellent

2735
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:12,960
question so uh it's of great importance

2736
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:15,239
to make sure that whatever we're

2737
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,960
designing can fit into either standard

2738
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:20,360
vectors or new vectors and space is a

2739
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:21,639
hot commodity uh in this setting the

2740
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:23,440
enhancers that we've designed in the

2741
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:25,119
study I showed you here are 100 base

2742
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:27,280
pairs but I'm working on shrinking them

2743
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:28,719
down to 50 uh which is about the size of

2744
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:31,320
the minimal promoters that we use in

2745
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:35,719
standard applications

2746
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:35,719
currently brilliant thank you so much

2747
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:40,280
Arya I think you can all see why I'm so

2748
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:42,800
wildly proud you know if this is our

2749
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:45,800
future then we have a lot to be uh proud

2750
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:47,520
of and look forward to so um as was

2751
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:49,719
evident in the question that I just

2752
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,840
asked Arya one of the most fundamental

2753
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:55,040
ways in which we communicate well before

2754
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:57,280
we had uh you know written uh textt for

2755
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:59,320
example to communicate with one another

2756
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,800
uh is actually storytelling um and it

2757
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:03,000
turns out that storytelling is what

2758
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,480
we've been doing here today scientific

2759
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,760
as well as personal family storytelling

2760
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:09,400
uh and it's a really effective way for

2761
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:10,960
humans to motivate one another uh it's a

2762
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,760
it's a way for us to motivate our

2763
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,040
elected officials for example our

2764
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:16,560
colleagues you know our community

2765
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:18,560
members our neighbors and so uh the next

2766
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,480
speaker is actually a master at

2767
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,920
storytelling I think that maybe you have

2768
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:25,280
um heard of feie parks and her white

2769
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:27,159
well-known uh podcast series Once Upon a

2770
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:30,400
gene but if you haven't I think she's

2771
01:46:27,159 --> 01:46:34,000
here to uh tell us um about um there she

2772
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:36,280
is about this uh uh Journey really that

2773
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,239
has been inspired by her son Ford so I

2774
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:40,760
will let her share the rest of the story

2775
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:40,760
with you

2776
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:53,719
eie so hi everyone like Anna said um my

2777
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:55,960
name is eie Parks and I'm so excited for

2778
01:46:53,719 --> 01:46:58,480
this 10year anniversary event it's such

2779
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:59,719
an honor to be here with you today um I

2780
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:03,480
always have a little bit of writer's

2781
01:46:59,719 --> 01:47:05,360
block before um I do a talk like this

2782
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:08,080
I'm always maybe a little bit down on

2783
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:11,159
myself and I don't have any letters

2784
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:13,760
behind my name I'm Ford's mom and I know

2785
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:16,520
I'm not alone there uh I can stare at a

2786
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:19,560
page a blank page for weeks and sit my

2787
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:22,400
coffee I will call a friend and stare

2788
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:25,560
some more look for ideas and advice and

2789
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:30,080
I just hope for some inspo to shake

2790
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:32,800
me and then it happens the dam opens up

2791
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:35,360
and the ideas that were stuck behind

2792
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:38,599
blank pages and negative selft talk come

2793
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:43,159
flooding out and that happened the other

2794
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:44,840
day for me I was like um wait a minute

2795
01:47:43,159 --> 01:47:47,159
I'm about to speak to a group of some of

2796
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:49,440
the most evolved

2797
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:52,320
scientists uh some of the most Brilliant

2798
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:53,360
Minds people who lead experience

2799
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,800
experiments

2800
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:59,440
who find patterns who create assays

2801
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:03,920
people who analyze genomes for

2802
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:06,960
breakfast surely these people believe in

2803
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:10,880
maybe the existence of little gray or

2804
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,880
green dudes that are light years

2805
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:18,760
away so why were aliens my idea for this

2806
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:21,159
talk that opened the

2807
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:23,760
floodgates it's because like being a row

2808
01:48:21,159 --> 01:48:26,080
disease parent is actually like

2809
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:29,719
being on another

2810
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:33,040
planet but let me back up and take you

2811
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:35,560
uh to my story 10 years ago in 2015 I

2812
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:38,320
married the love of my life and I got

2813
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:42,400
pregnant with my first child it was

2814
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:44,960
everything I had dreamed of a family

2815
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:46,679
motherhood uh everything was as bright

2816
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:51,400
as a

2817
01:48:46,679 --> 01:48:53,960
supernova we even had a space themed

2818
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:56,880
Nursery because the obvious next step

2819
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,880
for my child was

2820
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:04,280
NASA the metaphor really did feel

2821
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:06,400
magical and a perfect child ready to

2822
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:08,239
explore the infinite Universe of

2823
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,480
possibility was just

2824
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:14,199
magical but when my son was born it

2825
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,360
turned out that he was on a different

2826
01:49:14,199 --> 01:49:17,719
Mission and had I listened to the

2827
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:19,760
doctor's

2828
01:49:17,719 --> 01:49:23,760
explanation maybe a mission that would

2829
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,760
never have even left the LaunchPad

2830
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:30,560
it was certainly one that we did not

2831
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:33,520
expect something was wrong with our son

2832
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:35,440
and we didn't know what we found

2833
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:38,560
ourselves fighting to Simply keep him

2834
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:40,440
alive for the first couple of years

2835
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:43,719
addressing symptoms with hardly a moment

2836
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:47,320
to look up and recognize where we

2837
01:49:43,719 --> 01:49:49,400
were and then genetic testing pinpointed

2838
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:51,639
a diagnosis of an ultra rare disorder

2839
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:54,840
called ctnnb1

2840
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:58,520
syndrome at 16 months old it felt like

2841
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:02,920
we had crash landed onto an alien

2842
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:06,280
planet there was no road map no research

2843
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:09,719
no data points just

2844
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:12,280
emptiness there were no humans around us

2845
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:16,040
that spoke this new language and there

2846
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:18,960
were no treatments very few patients and

2847
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:22,119
no one to tell us what was

2848
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:25,080
next in a moment our world had gone from

2849
01:50:22,119 --> 01:50:28,679
the INF hope of the night sky to the

2850
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:28,679
vast cold emptiness of

2851
01:50:29,239 --> 01:50:34,800
space back then just 10 years ago social

2852
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:37,040
media was not the vast resource for

2853
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:39,760
families like mine like it is

2854
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:43,000
today costs for genetic testing were

2855
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:45,840
Skyhigh doctors were more skeptical and

2856
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:49,560
the pace of research felt painfully slow

2857
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:54,360
and progress impossible day

2858
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:57,719
today we were desperate

2859
01:50:54,360 --> 01:51:00,440
alone and searching for a guidepost in

2860
01:50:57,719 --> 01:51:02,800
any community that might say hey we're

2861
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:06,119
here in this weird place

2862
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:09,599
too we were not Travelers here my family

2863
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:13,159
and I we were Pioneers set out to

2864
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:15,440
terraform this strange

2865
01:51:13,159 --> 01:51:17,119
place and to make it a place that we

2866
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,520
could

2867
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:24,040
live and so I realized that if such a

2868
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:25,880
community did exist I better go looking

2869
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:28,920
so I did what any rational person would

2870
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,920
do and I started a

2871
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:36,159
podcast and I radioed for

2872
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:39,280
help once upon a jeene became my version

2873
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:42,320
of an Interstellar radio

2874
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,320
Beacon broadcasting into the

2875
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,880
void hoping

2876
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:48,760
someone

2877
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:53,079
anyone would

2878
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:55,440
respond and they did

2879
01:51:53,079 --> 01:51:56,719
suddenly families like mine were on the

2880
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:59,159
same

2881
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:01,480
frequency we were all these little

2882
01:51:59,159 --> 01:52:04,360
spaceships floating out there in the

2883
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:06,800
void Pew peing meteors and space

2884
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:09,480
monsters disguised as insurance denials

2885
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,480
and feeding

2886
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:14,880
tubes trying to dock compare notes and

2887
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:17,079
find

2888
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:21,239
refuge for many of us it was the first

2889
01:52:17,079 --> 01:52:21,239
time that we realized we weren't alone

2890
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:27,480
what started as my voice and the laugh

2891
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:29,719
track of my

2892
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:32,520
son it quickly

2893
01:52:29,719 --> 01:52:36,320
multiplied we compared notes we shared

2894
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:39,040
tips we found a new sense of comfort

2895
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:41,040
hope and a new sense of urgency from

2896
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:43,360
each other's

2897
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:45,520
stories in these early days we learned

2898
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,520
from

2899
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:50,840
Trailblazers families and Advocates who

2900
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:52,639
had been fighting for decades on behalf

2901
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:54,920
of rare diseases they discover long

2902
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:58,719
before the rest of us showed

2903
01:52:54,920 --> 01:53:01,000
up they passed on that knowledge and

2904
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:04,560
that share your homework

2905
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:08,199
mentality with each new org that showed

2906
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:10,520
up these Pioneers they taught us how to

2907
01:53:08,199 --> 01:53:12,679
navigate the medical system how to push

2908
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,560
for research how to speak up at

2909
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:17,480
conferences like this and how to find

2910
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:19,639
the essential resources we needed simply

2911
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,639
at

2912
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:25,360
home and the coolest thing

2913
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,320
with each new family on board our

2914
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:30,639
community didn't just grow in numbers it

2915
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:33,320
grew in

2916
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:36,880
power maybe we weren't just a bunch of

2917
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:39,079
Lone stars in the sky and maybe we were

2918
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,079
a

2919
01:53:40,119 --> 01:53:46,119
constellation we were building momentum

2920
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:48,599
and amplifying each other's

2921
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:51,920
voices and it's incredible to look back

2922
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:53,800
now and see how this turned into a

2923
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:56,400
movement

2924
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:57,920
with parents and caregivers driving

2925
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:00,880
research

2926
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:05,280
forward finding funding studies

2927
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:08,239
partnering with biotech and research and

2928
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:10,719
Industry we might not have lab coats but

2929
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:14,520
we know our children better than anyone

2930
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:16,920
and our Insight is crucial to any

2931
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:20,079
progress a few advances of the last

2932
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:23,599
decade uh once described off as far off

2933
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:25,560
has rapidly become part of our reality

2934
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:27,440
there's still plenty of work ahead but

2935
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:31,239
every year brings new tools new

2936
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:33,880
knowledge and most importantly

2937
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:36,760
hope genetic testing is a diagnostic

2938
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:38,800
tool once was the cost of a mortgage in

2939
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:42,159
my son's case a brand new

2940
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:44,079
car now it's less than a Netflix

2941
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:49,079
membership and you can get it through

2942
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:51,320
tella Health on your couch just like

2943
01:54:49,079 --> 01:54:53,800
Netflix this means that families can get

2944
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:56,480
an answer fast and skip the black hole

2945
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:58,599
of being unor

2946
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:01,840
misdiagnosed they can get to work a lot

2947
01:54:58,599 --> 01:55:05,040
faster in accelerating Global

2948
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:06,639
collaboration among advocacy and

2949
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,800
companies

2950
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,800
scientists patients and caregivers know

2951
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:14,679
that we shouldn't have to have our data

2952
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:19,040
locked away in a silo that we cannot

2953
01:55:14,679 --> 01:55:20,920
access we know to pool our resources in

2954
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:23,440
orgs like combined

2955
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:25,599
brain and we

2956
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:27,560
innovate tella health and remote care

2957
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,800
technology have been a

2958
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:32,440
godsend then we're flying across the

2959
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:35,679
country just to see the one

2960
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:38,119
expert for the last year 40 of our

2961
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:39,239
ctnnb1 patients have been wearing a

2962
01:55:38,119 --> 01:55:41,119
device that's been tracking their

2963
01:55:39,239 --> 01:55:42,679
movement disorder in preparation for a

2964
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:45,280
clinical

2965
01:55:42,679 --> 01:55:48,760
trial these rare

2966
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:51,920
families are more than Mom and Pop

2967
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,840
nonprofits they fund grants they found

2968
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:55,840
bio

2969
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:59,280
techs they have matured into

2970
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,760
CEOs policy experts and they radiate

2971
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:03,800
love for their children and their

2972
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:07,679
Community like a

2973
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:10,040
son the shift is

2974
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:12,800
happening each year more families

2975
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:16,360
connect and more solutions inch closer

2976
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:18,599
to reality solutions that once sounded

2977
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:21,040
like science

2978
01:56:18,599 --> 01:56:24,440
fiction and now there's the Hope

2979
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:25,840
part we didn't cling to Hope because it

2980
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:29,480
sounds

2981
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:31,840
nice hope is Prickly and sharp just as

2982
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:31,840
it is

2983
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:38,760
warm we build hope because it is fuel in

2984
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:40,920
our

2985
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:43,079
rocket the thing that keeps us searching

2986
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:45,760
for

2987
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:47,920
answers every new technology every new

2988
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:50,280
data sharing platform every connection

2989
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:52,599
that we make is a shooting

2990
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:55,599
star and in moving forward to together

2991
01:56:52,599 --> 01:56:57,800
how do we keep that momentum going we

2992
01:56:55,599 --> 01:57:00,800
collaborate

2993
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:03,079
relentlessly families scientists biotech

2994
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:07,000
Academia healthc care providers and

2995
01:57:03,079 --> 01:57:08,880
policy makers all have to work in sync

2996
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,760
because progress in rare disease thrives

2997
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:14,040
and can only work in

2998
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:14,040
Synergy not

2999
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:20,040
silos we tell our

3000
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,440
stories because personal narratives

3001
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:25,000
don't just Inspire hope they open doors

3002
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:27,639
to funding and research and

3003
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:31,360
understanding and because it turns out

3004
01:57:27,639 --> 01:57:34,960
people actually do want to hear

3005
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:37,520
them we question everything since we can

3006
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:40,079
assume any system works until it true

3007
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:42,880
doesn't work until it truly does we push

3008
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:45,840
for new approaches new cures and

3009
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:48,440
clinical trial designs that miror our

3010
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:51,920
real life

3011
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:54,719
experiences and finally we stay hopeful

3012
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:58,360
not not the fluffy blind optimism

3013
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:01,360
kind but the belief backed by

3014
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:04,199
action and maybe a little bit of rare

3015
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:04,199
parent crazy

3016
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:09,920
eyes because at the end of the day

3017
01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:12,840
that's how breakthroughs

3018
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:15,880
happen so there you have it my slightly

3019
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:18,840
derailed Journey from storye new mom to

3020
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:22,960
space themed Nursery to crash landing in

3021
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:25,040
an alien world of rare disease

3022
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,679
in the end though we realized we weren't

3023
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:29,719
in this galaxy

3024
01:58:26,679 --> 01:58:32,079
alone we formed a collective we fostered

3025
01:58:29,719 --> 01:58:33,880
community and we turned heartbreak into

3026
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:36,360
Innovation and

3027
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:38,920
hope and that's the kind of Unstoppable

3028
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:42,079
energy that we're here today

3029
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:46,400
celebrating when your world blows up you

3030
01:58:42,079 --> 01:58:49,960
adapt you innovate and you share and

3031
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:54,040
together we keep going while Pew peing

3032
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:54,040
all of those evil space monsters

3033
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:58,520
so thank you for letting me beam my

3034
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:00,960
story Into Your orbit

3035
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:02,159
today each of you are so vital to this

3036
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,440
unfolding

3037
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:06,320
Mission I'm convinced that together we

3038
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:09,320
can end rare

3039
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:12,079
disease while I have felt like an alien

3040
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:13,920
on another planet these last several

3041
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:17,960
years and I

3042
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:20,480
was I felt like I was forced onto that

3043
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:22,280
planet I am starting to understand that

3044
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:25,000
maybe we were never actually needing to

3045
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:27,719
board ships and rock it off to some

3046
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:31,239
distant Galaxy to find our

3047
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:34,880
people we were all right here on Earth

3048
01:59:31,239 --> 01:59:36,920
scattered by isolation and

3049
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:39,040
Circumstance but once we connected and

3050
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:40,639
once we found each other we realized

3051
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:44,360
that this planet has everything we need

3052
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:47,280
to innovate collaborate and make a

3053
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:49,440
difference this isn't about chasing the

3054
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:53,560
Stars this is about bringing the

3055
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:53,560
stranded explorers home

3056
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:59,400
there will be setbacks and failures on

3057
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:03,480
the way to the safe landing that we all

3058
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:06,400
dream of but we cannot accept what we

3059
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:07,599
cannot accept is progress being stalled

3060
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,880
by the lack of

3061
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:12,679
collaboration communication and

3062
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:15,280
willingness to work

3063
02:00:12,679 --> 02:00:18,079
together I want to hear everyone our

3064
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:20,880
scientific Community academic industry

3065
02:00:18,079 --> 02:00:22,560
Partners stepping up and Sharing Hope

3066
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,560
and knowledge just just like our rare

3067
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:27,639
disease Community has

3068
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:30,239
done we don't have to separate to A

3069
02:00:27,639 --> 02:00:32,880
Whole New World we just have to join

3070
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:35,119
forces to make this one better than we

3071
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,119
found

3072
02:00:36,599 --> 02:00:42,800
it in all serious thoughness though if

3073
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:44,400
anyone does have Intel on some

3074
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:47,239
extraterrestrial

3075
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:49,440
beings please find me after because I'm

3076
02:00:47,239 --> 02:00:50,800
pretty sure I could pitch them um to

3077
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:53,920
join our patient registry or at least

3078
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:53,920
give me a sample for the bio

3079
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:00,000
so beam me up broes I can do this all

3080
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:02,880
day with the analogies I'm thank you I'm

3081
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,880
done thank you for

3082
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,360
listening if you have a question I'm

3083
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:10,679
happy to answer I know we're running a

3084
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:13,760
little

3085
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:18,320
overtime questions for

3086
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:18,320
feie okay thank you thank you so

3087
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:27,560
much okay so by now you're noticing how

3088
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:30,480
masterfully um Jillian uh has been

3089
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:33,159
weaving in the stories uh this afternoon

3090
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:35,280
so we're doing science and we're doing

3091
02:01:33,159 --> 02:01:37,560
uh Advocate and family stories and then

3092
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:39,719
coming back to science and so it's my

3093
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:43,159
great pleasure to uh bring us back to

3094
02:01:39,719 --> 02:01:45,880
some really cool um innovative ideas um

3095
02:01:43,159 --> 02:01:48,920
around another um uh rare uh disease

3096
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:51,360
Marfan syndrome um our speaker is aany

3097
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:53,400
ragavan uh who is a postto in Patrick

3098
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:56,560
Elanor group she's also a cardiologist

3099
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:58,440
at Mass General um and again one of the

3100
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,760
people in the younger generation will W

3101
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:03,920
wildly proud of and you're about to uh

3102
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:03,920
find out why so

3103
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:13,280
Avante um thank you so much for that

3104
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,320
introduction and um a huge thank you to

3105
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:18,599
latters to as well as the Tamir

3106
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:20,239
Foundation um for organizing this um

3107
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:23,960
it's a real privilege to speak here

3108
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:27,199
today so um as Dr grea mentioned um I

3109
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:28,560
have dual roles I'm um a cardiologist at

3110
02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:30,719
Mass General and then I'm also a

3111
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:32,599
researcher here at the broad and really

3112
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:34,880
the focus of all of my work my clinical

3113
02:02:32,599 --> 02:02:37,560
and my research work is thoracic aortic

3114
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,920
disease and a few years ago that led me

3115
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:42,760
to a rare disease called Marfan syndrome

3116
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:44,560
which is a melan form of aortic disease

3117
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:45,920
and so for the next 10 minutes or so I

3118
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,920
want to tell you about some of the work

3119
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:50,679
we've been doing um to uh accelerate

3120
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:52,840
therapeutic development for this

3121
02:02:50,679 --> 02:02:55,639
disorder

3122
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:58,320
so what is Marfan syndrome um like I

3123
02:02:55,639 --> 02:03:00,560
mentioned it's a melan u it's a melan

3124
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:02,719
connective tissue disorder and it's

3125
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:05,400
caused by mutations in the fibrin one

3126
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:07,199
gene so fibrin one encodes an

3127
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:09,320
extracellular Matrix protein it's

3128
02:03:07,199 --> 02:03:11,599
expressed throughout the body and so as

3129
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:14,360
you can imagine these patients have

3130
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:15,800
multi-stem connected tissue issues and

3131
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:18,880
often they're recognizable because

3132
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:20,560
they're unusually tall and thin but over

3133
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:22,840
the course of their life they develop

3134
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:25,679
many issues including skeletal issues

3135
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:27,760
pulmonary issues ocular issues and then

3136
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:29,599
most importantly the most feared

3137
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,800
complication of Marfan syndrome is

3138
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:35,520
aortic disease so what is the aorta it's

3139
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:38,239
the biggest blood vessel in the body so

3140
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:40,440
every year our hearts beat 35 million

3141
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:43,239
times and with each of those heartbeats

3142
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:45,480
our aortas have to expand to accommodate

3143
02:03:43,239 --> 02:03:47,840
that entire blood volume under high

3144
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:50,239
pressures and distribute blood to all of

3145
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:52,360
our body's organs and so that takes a

3146
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:55,000
lot of contractile as well as elastic

3147
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:58,040
strength and so in Marfan syndrome

3148
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,520
fibrillin mutations lead to aneurysmal

3149
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:03,040
degeneration and weakening of the aortic

3150
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:05,400
wall so over time as early as

3151
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:07,480
adolescence into early adulthood

3152
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:10,000
individuals develop aneurysms or

3153
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:12,280
enlargement of the aorta and this can

3154
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,239
predispose to acute complications such

3155
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:17,280
as aortic tears or rupture and this in

3156
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:19,159
fact is the leading cause of death in

3157
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:21,559
Marfan

3158
02:04:19,159 --> 02:04:23,599
syndrome so traditionally there have

3159
02:04:21,559 --> 02:04:26,239
been been two pillars of treatment for

3160
02:04:23,599 --> 02:04:28,199
Maran so the first is surgery you can

3161
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:30,840
have an open heart surgery where the

3162
02:04:28,199 --> 02:04:32,559
surgeon goes in and basically cuts out

3163
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:35,119
the disease portion of the aorta and

3164
02:04:32,559 --> 02:04:37,040
replaces it with a graft and this may or

3165
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:39,320
may not be Curative for some patients it

3166
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:41,000
is other patients they continue to have

3167
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:42,639
issues over the course of their life

3168
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,400
they continue to develop issues

3169
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:47,760
involving parts of their aorta that were

3170
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:50,400
not replaced and so for those patients

3171
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:52,520
we can offer medical therapy and really

3172
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:54,119
we only have two classes of medications

3173
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:57,079
we can offer these patients they're both

3174
02:04:54,119 --> 02:04:59,119
blood pressure agents and they show sort

3175
02:04:57,079 --> 02:05:01,199
of variable benefit in terms of slowing

3176
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:02,960
aortic growth but the one thing I want

3177
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:04,719
to point out is that both these classes

3178
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,800
of medications have been around for

3179
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:08,920
decades and so I think that kind of

3180
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,960
speaks to the fact that there really

3181
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:14,440
hasn't been much meaningful therapeutic

3182
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:17,119
advancement in this area for many many

3183
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:19,000
years and so when I you know first

3184
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:21,480
became interested in studying aortic

3185
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:24,199
disease a few years ago um I noticed

3186
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:26,360
that traditionally genomics and a lot of

3187
02:05:24,199 --> 02:05:28,719
these high throughput technologies that

3188
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:30,840
we routinely use at the broad had not

3189
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:33,480
ever really been applied to aortic

3190
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:35,159
disease in a meaningful way and so our

3191
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:36,719
kind of overarching goal was to think

3192
02:05:35,159 --> 02:05:38,639
about how we could leverage some of the

3193
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:40,760
strengths of the Bro Institute in

3194
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:42,920
genomewide association studies single

3195
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:44,920
cell multiomic studies high content

3196
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:46,920
Imaging and combine them with more

3197
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:49,320
traditional approaches such as Mouse

3198
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,239
modeling and molecular biology to

3199
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:53,040
accelerate the pace of therapeutic

3200
02:05:51,239 --> 02:05:55,760
Target get identification and

3201
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:57,239
development from our fan syndrome so

3202
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:59,520
over the next 10 minutes I hope to give

3203
02:05:57,239 --> 02:06:01,360
you a flavor of some of the efforts that

3204
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:03,000
we've been um we've been doing on

3205
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:05,040
several of these

3206
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,719
fronts so one of the first things I

3207
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:08,840
wanted to do is I realized we didn't

3208
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:11,599
have a tissue biobank for Marfan

3209
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:13,760
syndrome and I was extraordinarily lucky

3210
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:16,719
to work with a couple of folks um

3211
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:18,040
Antonio ceso is a cardiac surgeon at MGH

3212
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:19,840
um as well as Ben Landis who's a

3213
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:22,320
Pediatric Cardiologist at Indiana

3214
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:24,159
University and we actually established a

3215
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:26,760
pipeline for collecting aortic tissue

3216
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:28,960
from Marfan syndrome patients um and so

3217
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:31,639
what we do is we chart review and we

3218
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:34,360
consent all eligible patients not only

3219
02:06:31,639 --> 02:06:36,760
with Marfan but many other rare genetic

3220
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:39,679
aortopathies um and so we consent them

3221
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:41,719
prior to their elective aortic operation

3222
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:43,639
and then we go to the O and so as soon

3223
02:06:41,719 --> 02:06:46,159
as that aortic tissue becomes available

3224
02:06:43,639 --> 02:06:49,000
we flash freeze it so it's as fresh and

3225
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:50,719
as fresh as possible and then we Bank it

3226
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,800
and just in the past few years alone

3227
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:55,599
we've been lucky that MGH is such a high

3228
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:57,679
volume aortic Center we've collected 16

3229
02:06:55,599 --> 02:07:00,400
tissues from Marfan syndrome patients to

3230
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:02,760
date as well as over 30 healthy control

3231
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:04,520
tissues and so in the next few months

3232
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:07,880
and years our goal is to use these

3233
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:09,760
tissues to inform um various techniques

3234
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:11,320
including single cell transcriptomics

3235
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:14,119
and

3236
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:16,679
epigenomics but flash Frozen tissue just

3237
02:07:14,119 --> 02:07:18,920
kind of gives you this snapshot of gene

3238
02:07:16,679 --> 02:07:20,719
expression um at a certain moment in

3239
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:22,199
time and so what we really wanted is we

3240
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:23,880
wanted a system

3241
02:07:22,199 --> 02:07:25,400
that kind of gives you a more Dynamic

3242
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:26,960
readout right so what if we want to

3243
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:30,440
perform a drug screen what if we want to

3244
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:32,239
perform a crisper screen so most of the

3245
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:33,960
pathology in Marfan syndrome really

3246
02:07:32,239 --> 02:07:35,960
centers on the smooth muscle cell the

3247
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:37,719
smooth muscle cell um is the most

3248
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:39,440
abundant cell type in the aorta and I

3249
02:07:37,719 --> 02:07:41,079
mentioned earlier that the aorta needs a

3250
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:42,719
lot of contractile strength and it's the

3251
02:07:41,079 --> 02:07:45,040
smooth muscle cell that gives it that

3252
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:46,719
contractile strength and so it turns out

3253
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:48,440
that if you have a fresh aortic biopsy

3254
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:50,840
you can actually isolate that muscular

3255
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:52,440
layer you can put it into culture and

3256
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:54,360
the smooth muscle cells grow out so you

3257
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:56,320
can establish lines directly from

3258
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:58,159
patients and so we've been doing that

3259
02:07:56,320 --> 02:08:00,599
over the past few years we've generated

3260
02:07:58,159 --> 02:08:03,800
multiple um Marian syndrome lines from

3261
02:08:00,599 --> 02:08:06,280
multiple patients and so then we asked

3262
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:09,159
can we develop some sort of morphologic

3263
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:11,119
profiling technique in order to kind of

3264
02:08:09,159 --> 02:08:13,639
understand how these disease cell lines

3265
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:16,119
look and so to do that we took advantage

3266
02:08:13,639 --> 02:08:17,920
of of um something that we know about

3267
02:08:16,119 --> 02:08:20,320
endstage aneurysm so in endstage

3268
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:22,079
aneurysm um smooth muscle cells lose a

3269
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:23,719
lot of their contractile abilities and

3270
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:26,480
they upregulate a lot of synthetic

3271
02:08:23,719 --> 02:08:28,360
markers like collagen and so we stained

3272
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:30,400
a couple of different um couple of

3273
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:32,920
different components of the cell um the

3274
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,760
actin cytoskeleton collagen um as well

3275
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:37,880
as smad which is an important signaling

3276
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:39,360
mediator in the TGF beta pathway and we

3277
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:41,679
just looked at our cell lines under the

3278
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:43,639
microscope and so here I have two

3279
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:45,719
different well type lines on top and the

3280
02:08:43,639 --> 02:08:47,440
bottom I have a Maran line and if you

3281
02:08:45,719 --> 02:08:49,000
look at like the highest seating density

3282
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:51,440
it's I mean the cells are just totally

3283
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:53,280
different which is not surprising so the

3284
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:55,239
wild type lines are green they have lots

3285
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:57,000
of contractile features and then the

3286
02:08:55,239 --> 02:08:58,599
Maran lines they're more orange so

3287
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,040
they're they have all this collagen and

3288
02:08:58,599 --> 02:09:01,800
in fact when you look at these

3289
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:03,920
morphologic features in the disease

3290
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:05,520
lines over a third of those features are

3291
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:07,840
totally different in the in the disease

3292
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:10,119
line and so we're really excited to see

3293
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:12,320
that phenotype um and of course we can

3294
02:09:10,119 --> 02:09:14,719
quantify individual phenotypes But

3295
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:17,679
ultimately our goal is to identify

3296
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:20,760
features that are common um across

3297
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:22,400
multiple donor lines and eventually the

3298
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:25,280
goal really is to perform a reversion

3299
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:28,199
screen so to look for small molecules or

3300
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:30,079
to look for um guide rnas that can

3301
02:09:28,199 --> 02:09:31,840
actually revert that disease phenotype

3302
02:09:30,079 --> 02:09:34,440
right back to a healthy

3303
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:36,239
cell so I've spent some time telling you

3304
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:37,679
about things that we want to do um in

3305
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:39,040
order to accelerate theraputic

3306
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:40,880
development and so for the second part

3307
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:42,840
of this talk I actually want to tell you

3308
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:44,800
a specific story about a Target that

3309
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:46,920
we've already found and that we're super

3310
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:49,599
excited about um and this is a really

3311
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:51,960
special story from our lab a few years

3312
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:54,719
ago um our group did a genome wide

3313
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:57,000
Association study looking at aortic size

3314
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:59,440
and found over 80 loai that were

3315
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,199
associated with aortic size and I have a

3316
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:03,000
Manhattan plot from the study showing

3317
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:05,760
all those genetic loai with the P value

3318
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,639
on the Y AIS um and I simplified it to

3319
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:09,599
show you just two loai so one of them

3320
02:10:07,639 --> 02:10:12,119
was fibral in one so we found fibral in

3321
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:13,719
one which is good that's reassuring um

3322
02:10:12,119 --> 02:10:15,840
and then another Gene that jumped out to

3323
02:10:13,719 --> 02:10:17,719
us very early on was this one Locus on

3324
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:20,119
chromosome 16 called

3325
02:10:17,719 --> 02:10:21,719
wwp2 and and we that kind of made us

3326
02:10:20,119 --> 02:10:23,880
raise our eyebrows because we' never

3327
02:10:21,719 --> 02:10:27,840
heard of this Gene being connected to

3328
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:30,119
aortic biology before so um what what

3329
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:32,679
was it about this Gene that that made us

3330
02:10:30,119 --> 02:10:34,920
excited now when we do a GS of course we

3331
02:10:32,679 --> 02:10:37,000
found lots and lots of genes but really

3332
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:39,639
what we're looking for is the Unicorn so

3333
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,040
we're looking for that one gene that has

3334
02:10:39,639 --> 02:10:44,400
some set of intrinsic qualities that

3335
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:46,040
tells us this Gene is going to be

3336
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:49,199
successful in the Target development

3337
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:52,000
Pipeline and wwp2 just had them all so

3338
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:54,400
what were those features so first of all

3339
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,599
when you look at expression of wwp2

3340
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:59,559
across all tissues in the body what

3341
02:10:56,599 --> 02:11:01,719
jumps out at you is that wwp2 is highly

3342
02:10:59,559 --> 02:11:03,920
enriched in arterial tissues and the

3343
02:11:01,719 --> 02:11:05,400
expression is in fact highest in aorta

3344
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:08,079
which tells you that if you were to

3345
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:09,800
employ a wwp2 directed therapy

3346
02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:12,880
theoretically it should have the highest

3347
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:14,440
impact in aorta which is what we want

3348
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:16,320
and then the second thing we found was a

3349
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:18,520
very favorable directionality so we

3350
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:21,679
found that the minor Al of the lead snip

3351
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:24,599
at this Locus is associated with less

3352
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:27,079
wwp2 expression in aorta as well as

3353
02:11:24,599 --> 02:11:30,679
smaller aortic size so what does that

3354
02:11:27,079 --> 02:11:32,559
mean less wwp2 equals smaller aorta

3355
02:11:30,679 --> 02:11:34,119
which is good right so that tells you

3356
02:11:32,559 --> 02:11:37,719
first that we should focus on developing

3357
02:11:34,119 --> 02:11:39,480
a wwp2 inhibitor but and two right it's

3358
02:11:37,719 --> 02:11:40,920
easier to develop an inhibitor typically

3359
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:43,159
to a protein product than it is to

3360
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:45,199
develop an activator so for all these

3361
02:11:43,159 --> 02:11:47,159
reasons the strong genetic Association

3362
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:48,920
the tissue specificity and this

3363
02:11:47,159 --> 02:11:50,840
favorable directionality we felt that

3364
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:53,320
all the stars had aligned and this was

3365
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:56,239
the target Target that we wanted to go

3366
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:58,400
after so how did we do this we used

3367
02:11:56,239 --> 02:12:00,199
Mouse model so it turns out that there's

3368
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:02,199
a Marfan syndrome Mouse model it has a

3369
02:12:00,199 --> 02:12:03,719
point mutation in fibrin one and it

3370
02:12:02,199 --> 02:12:06,320
phenocopies the human disease

3371
02:12:03,719 --> 02:12:08,320
beautifully um so these these mice are

3372
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:10,800
long just like Marfan syndrome patients

3373
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:12,719
are tall they have skeletal overgrowth

3374
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:16,040
um and they develop aortic aneurysms

3375
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:19,040
from a really young age and so we took a

3376
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:21,000
um we took um a mouse that had wwp2

3377
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:23,199
inactivated alals and we crossed it onto

3378
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,360
the Marfan Cinder background and then we

3379
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:27,320
looked at the size of the aorta using

3380
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:29,440
ultrasound so we actually do this in

3381
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:31,480
humans except Mouse is about 25 times

3382
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:33,960
smaller so we can use ultrasound to look

3383
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:36,119
at the aorta um in mice and I've kind of

3384
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:39,119
colored in the aorta on those um Mouse

3385
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:41,559
images for you and what we found is that

3386
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:43,960
from Wild Type in purple to Marfan and

3387
02:12:41,559 --> 02:12:45,719
blue you see an increase in aortic size

3388
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:47,960
which is what you would expect and then

3389
02:12:45,719 --> 02:12:50,079
you see that that increase is attenuated

3390
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:52,320
when you go from the Maran to the Marfan

3391
02:12:50,079 --> 02:12:54,239
mice that have w P2

3392
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:56,199
inactivated and then when you look at

3393
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:58,480
those aortas under the microscope they

3394
02:12:56,199 --> 02:13:00,159
look better so one of the histologic

3395
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:02,520
features of aneurism is you have a lot

3396
02:13:00,159 --> 02:13:04,520
of elastin fragmentation we clearly see

3397
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:06,400
that in the Marian mice and that seems

3398
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:09,760
to be attenuated to some degree in the

3399
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:12,840
Marfan mice with the wwp2 in

3400
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:16,280
Activation so wwp2 is an E3 ubiquit and

3401
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:18,679
ligase um it functions um to transfer

3402
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:20,639
ubiquit into a substrate protein and so

3403
02:13:18,679 --> 02:13:23,239
in some ongoing work um we're using

3404
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:25,360
different proteomics approaches to

3405
02:13:23,239 --> 02:13:27,800
identify um Downstream substrates of

3406
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:29,880
wwp2 that may be responsible for this

3407
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:32,400
effect on aortic

3408
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:35,119
biology so um that kind of brings me to

3409
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:36,719
the end of my talk um and I I covered a

3410
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:39,040
lot of ground today but what I want to

3411
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:41,079
say is that um you know a lot of this

3412
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:43,400
work is early we started um many of

3413
02:13:41,079 --> 02:13:45,360
these efforts just a few years ago um

3414
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:47,400
and our long-term goal is really to

3415
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:49,079
integrate functional genomics High

3416
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,280
throat B biology as well as Mouse

3417
02:13:49,079 --> 02:13:53,320
modeling to identify novel therapeu big

3418
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:55,760
targets for Marfan

3419
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:57,639
syndrome um we've invested a lot of

3420
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:59,079
effort the past few years into resource

3421
02:13:57,639 --> 02:14:01,440
development so we're establishing a

3422
02:13:59,079 --> 02:14:03,159
biobank for Marfan we're establishing a

3423
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:05,040
lot of primary cell lines from these

3424
02:14:03,159 --> 02:14:06,840
patients um and then of course we've

3425
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:09,079
identified a promising Target already

3426
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:11,239
that we're really excited about studying

3427
02:14:09,079 --> 02:14:13,199
further so thank you so much for your

3428
02:14:11,239 --> 02:14:15,599
attention um a huge thank you to the

3429
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:16,920
Eleanor lab um for making all of this

3430
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:20,960
work possible as well as to our

3431
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:20,960
collaborators thank you

3432
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:29,480
hey um really cool talk just on the

3433
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,400
human genetics is there a natural

3434
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:33,840
experiment where you have a Marans

3435
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:36,079
patient who just has a natural mutation

3436
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:38,040
in wwp2 that happens to have a small

3437
02:14:36,079 --> 02:14:40,559
aort or something that's protected is

3438
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:43,280
there like a proof of genetics there

3439
02:14:40,559 --> 02:14:45,400
yeah so that's a great question um so

3440
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:47,360
when our group did the original gwas we

3441
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:49,520
did look for rare variants this wasn't

3442
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:52,199
in Marfan patients just in in general so

3443
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,719
we looked for rare variants in wwp2

3444
02:14:52,199 --> 02:14:55,880
unfortunately the burden of rear

3445
02:14:53,719 --> 02:14:57,880
variance in wwp2 just wasn't high enough

3446
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:59,880
to understand if potentially there's

3447
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:01,199
some kind of protective effect certainly

3448
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:03,000
in the future I think it would be really

3449
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:04,880
interesting to look at maybe large

3450
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,119
cohorts of of patients with Marfan

3451
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:08,639
syndrome um there is a lot of phenotypic

3452
02:15:07,119 --> 02:15:10,840
heterogenity and Marfan syndrome so

3453
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:13,280
there are over 3,000 mutations in the

3454
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:15,040
fibrin one Gene and different mutations

3455
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:17,480
are associated with different disease

3456
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:18,840
penetrance and expressivity so it may be

3457
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:21,000
a little bit challenging to sort of

3458
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:23,040
tease apart the effect of the mutation

3459
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,760
versus the effec of wwp2 in activation

3460
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:29,079
but it's a really really excellent

3461
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:32,119
question thank you fantastic so in y map

3462
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:34,719
so besides wwp2 there are a lot of top

3463
02:15:32,119 --> 02:15:37,679
hits yes so what are those SC and what

3464
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:39,840
do we study those sorry why do you

3465
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:43,840
choose ww

3466
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:48,559
P2 not all other top HS oh why it was

3467
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:51,840
wwp2 so I I think you know wwp2 was just

3468
02:15:48,559 --> 02:15:54,199
um of all the 80 something lowside that

3469
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:55,920
we identified that was the one that we

3470
02:15:54,199 --> 02:15:59,280
thought just based on a certain set of

3471
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:01,000
qualities just seemed most likely to be

3472
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:02,480
successful in just from a drug

3473
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,320
development perspective obviously you

3474
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:06,320
don't know until you model it but I

3475
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:09,440
think we were really excited about the

3476
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:11,119
clear tissue specificity for aorta um as

3477
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:13,800
well as the fact that it seemed like

3478
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:16,400
inhibiting wwp2 was the way to kind of

3479
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:18,280
attenuate aortic disease so that kind of

3480
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:20,320
jumped out just from the genetics data

3481
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:22,719
but I think ultimately our goal is to

3482
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:25,000
look at a lot of these other gai using

3483
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:26,719
some of these using crisper screens and

3484
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,119
other screens with our morphologic

3485
02:16:26,719 --> 02:16:33,040
profiling platform um to identify other

3486
02:16:29,119 --> 02:16:35,730
potential targets for the disease thank

3487
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:40,439
you thank

3488
02:16:35,730 --> 02:16:42,960
[Applause]

3489
02:16:40,439 --> 02:16:45,679
you our next talk is going to take us

3490
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:48,359
back to the company creation space so

3491
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:52,599
I'm really happy to introduce tanas

3492
02:16:48,359 --> 02:16:55,200
chanduka he is a 2024 prier fellow um

3493
02:16:52,599 --> 02:16:57,519
he's a physician and serial entrepreneur

3494
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:59,399
every time I talk to him I learn about a

3495
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:02,800
new company that he has spun out from

3496
02:16:59,399 --> 02:17:04,920
his work um he's currently the CEO of

3497
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:06,519
tab Therapeutics which focuses in the

3498
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:09,679
cancer space but today he's going to

3499
02:17:06,519 --> 02:17:11,639
talk to us about his journey with nandi

3500
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:14,639
um which focuses on cancer Auto

3501
02:17:11,639 --> 02:17:16,559
autoimmune and rare disease

3502
02:17:14,639 --> 02:17:19,319
welcome thank

3503
02:17:16,559 --> 02:17:21,160
you okay no no no no no no you can do it

3504
02:17:19,319 --> 02:17:23,479
at the end you can do it at the end to

3505
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:26,240
the end um let's get the device let's

3506
02:17:23,479 --> 02:17:28,760
see is this working I'm not screwing it

3507
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:31,760
up great how are you guys

3508
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:34,960
doing are we sounding like people who

3509
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:37,679
are solving for rare diseases or

3510
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:41,599
not can I hear the people at the

3511
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:45,040
back can I get a hell yeah there we go

3512
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:46,920
there we go so over the past two weeks I

3513
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,040
have been in multiple cities I've been

3514
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:51,599
in Houston Texas where we're building

3515
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:53,559
some of our exciting uh compan ianes

3516
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:55,040
I've been in Florida in Fort Lauderdale

3517
02:17:53,559 --> 02:17:57,960
having a great time with one of my

3518
02:17:55,040 --> 02:18:01,160
co-founders working intensively on a

3519
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:04,319
manufacturing problem in China and then

3520
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:07,240
I'm here today why do I do this I would

3521
02:18:04,319 --> 02:18:09,920
do nothing else with my life I love

3522
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:12,840
creating companies finding people who

3523
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:15,200
have a mission that they want to um use

3524
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:18,399
biotechnology to solve and empowering

3525
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:20,559
them to do that that is my gift on Earth

3526
02:18:18,399 --> 02:18:23,200
is to bring people together and to solve

3527
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:24,639
those problems I'm an mdphd by

3528
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:27,160
background I was a road scholar at

3529
02:18:24,639 --> 02:18:29,559
Africa sorry in in in Oxford University

3530
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:31,599
I was born in South Africa my home I

3531
02:18:29,559 --> 02:18:33,479
love that place haven't been in 5 years

3532
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:35,519
because I'm so busy doing this stuff but

3533
02:18:33,479 --> 02:18:37,359
it lives inside me and it's important

3534
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:40,120
for you to know that because the people

3535
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:42,519
in Africa need these medicines and my

3536
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:45,359
thesis is if I can create medicines that

3537
02:18:42,519 --> 02:18:47,319
can translate into something valuable

3538
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:49,840
for all the people in this room then

3539
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:51,880
will cover my continent so that's the

3540
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:55,439
thesis that's the thesis of impact right

3541
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:57,120
there I'm very lucky that um I I I went

3542
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:59,479
through a background of having uh

3543
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:01,240
studied at Oxford and then been involved

3544
02:18:59,479 --> 02:19:03,359
in Venture Capital working for Europe's

3545
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:05,719
largest early stage life science fund

3546
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:09,080
called Oxford science Innovation I was

3547
02:19:05,719 --> 02:19:10,800
involved in helping to stand up 55 life

3548
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:13,200
science companies out of the company's

3549
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:15,280
100 portfolio companies that equals very

3550
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:17,399
little sleep and you know what I put my

3551
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:18,719
hand up for all the tough things because

3552
02:19:17,399 --> 02:19:20,840
that's how you become a good company

3553
02:19:18,719 --> 02:19:23,080
Creator and because of that I became

3554
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:24,800
involved in the oxid vaccine now some of

3555
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:27,240
you didn't get

3556
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:29,000
that um but two billion people on the

3557
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,559
planet did and it did make a difference

3558
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,519
for them and I was very proud to have

3559
02:19:30,559 --> 02:19:34,639
been one of two people in our life

3560
02:19:32,519 --> 02:19:37,519
science team who put my hand up in

3561
02:19:34,639 --> 02:19:39,399
January of 2022 to say which sry 2020

3562
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:41,960
say that we would shut down the company

3563
02:19:39,399 --> 02:19:43,719
because the flu vaccine had failed and

3564
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:47,280
at the bottom of everyone's screen was

3565
02:19:43,719 --> 02:19:49,240
this this little uh you know pulmonary

3566
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:51,359
infection that's happening in Wuhan in

3567
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:52,560
China it's not a big thing and it turned

3568
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:54,479
out to have been one of the most

3569
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:56,359
important projects I was involved in

3570
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:58,800
through that I was recruited uh by a

3571
02:19:56,359 --> 02:20:00,680
gentleman called bobach azamian um or

3572
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:02,640
Bobby aaman to work as Director of

3573
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:05,479
Business Development at his uh

3574
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:06,960
biotechnology company in in California

3575
02:20:05,479 --> 02:20:09,399
and that afforded me the opportunity to

3576
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:12,520
work in a public biotech company from 40

3577
02:20:09,399 --> 02:20:15,319
employees to to to a much uh bigger

3578
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:17,280
level I I could sit in meetings were

3579
02:20:15,319 --> 02:20:18,560
requiring companies I could work on

3580
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:20,960
everyday problems like how are we going

3581
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:23,200
to make this app that reads people's to

3582
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:24,720
launch a drug product but all of these

3583
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,720
things have been instrumental in

3584
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:28,800
becoming a company Creator I want to

3585
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:31,160
stop here for a second and highlight uh

3586
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:32,960
the woman who's here she is my sister

3587
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:35,479
and I managed to convince her to leave

3588
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:37,760
her job at meta she's a corporate lawyer

3589
02:20:35,479 --> 02:20:40,520
by background m&a lawyer uh trained at

3590
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:42,479
Baker McKenzie multiple IPOs on the uh

3591
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:45,160
London Stock Exchange and New York Stock

3592
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:47,359
Exchange and worked at uh Morgan Stanley

3593
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:49,560
and then later on at meta and she acts

3594
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:50,800
as the executive chair of nandi Life

3595
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:54,640
Sciences and I'll tell you about bit

3596
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:57,000
about n9y today um we're values driven

3597
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:59,680
people every day we're making decisions

3598
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:02,160
in our companies that are yes based on

3599
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:05,160
science yes based on financials but that

3600
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:07,160
are based on integrity and who we are

3601
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:10,520
I'm a doctor first which means I have a

3602
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:12,000
line there are things that I will not do

3603
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:14,359
and I think it's important for everyone

3604
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:16,600
in this room to think about that for a

3605
02:21:14,359 --> 02:21:17,920
second sometimes there are medicines we

3606
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:20,600
can develop and sometimes there are

3607
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:22,080
medicines we should not develop and it

3608
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:23,720
comes down to these values and you'll

3609
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:26,640
notice that the first one there is being

3610
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:28,760
relentless because developing drugs like

3611
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:31,000
the family that's here requires you to

3612
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:32,520
give everything of yourself think about

3613
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:35,560
that for a second in terms of what that

3614
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:38,240
means but also to be an advocate to be

3615
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:40,600
impactful to be empathetic and sometimes

3616
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:42,520
to actually take one for the team

3617
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:44,720
because you have to make decisions that

3618
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:47,280
are Guided by integrity and I think all

3619
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:50,960
too often we don't talk about what that

3620
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:52,880
actually means um look at me you know

3621
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:55,160
exactly that I don't sound like I come

3622
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:56,760
from here and you know like I'm in a

3623
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:58,720
country where sometimes things can get a

3624
02:21:56,760 --> 02:22:01,840
little bit weird at this moment let's be

3625
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:03,640
honest and um so what did I do I knew

3626
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:05,720
that I wasn't going to raise money here

3627
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:07,240
because I didn't go to Harvard I don't

3628
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:09,920
have the social network let's just be

3629
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:12,960
honest so what did I do I found a group

3630
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:15,520
of crazy people in in in Texas who have

3631
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:18,160
a lot of money and believe in crazy

3632
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:20,760
people like me to build something like

3633
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:23,520
this and what did they do they gave me

3634
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:25,520
healthare benefits a stien to work at

3635
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:27,240
and that's the Texas Medical Center

3636
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:29,760
right so please throw away all your

3637
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:32,000
conceptions of who is capable to

3638
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:34,319
innovate where they live you know just

3639
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:36,319
hustle just do what you need to so I

3640
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:38,680
found my path to being a company Creator

3641
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:40,760
in Houston Texas beautiful place the

3642
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:42,720
world's largest life science Community

3643
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:45,040
actually if you arrive there you'll see

3644
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:47,319
it it's a city they see 10 million

3645
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:49,399
patients a year rare diseases are pretty

3646
02:22:47,319 --> 02:22:51,000
common down there and great doctors who

3647
02:22:49,399 --> 02:22:52,399
trained here and around the world world

3648
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,319
who are there doing great things so

3649
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:58,040
let's just work together so what what do

3650
02:22:55,319 --> 02:23:01,600
I do at nandi what we do is we partner

3651
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:03,600
with Scientists with great ideas who

3652
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:05,399
generally may not know someone who has a

3653
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,280
lot of money because maybe they didn't

3654
02:23:05,399 --> 02:23:08,439
go to college with them or they just

3655
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:11,600
don't know how to communicate it

3656
02:23:08,439 --> 02:23:14,160
fluently and what we do is we will spend

3657
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:17,479
months Landscaping a particular disease

3658
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:21,040
area finding um identifying unmet

3659
02:23:17,479 --> 02:23:23,520
clinical needs for example um

3660
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:25,520
what if you have a renal kidney disorder

3661
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:27,600
and we've just understood the basic

3662
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:30,800
biology but there are no medicines to

3663
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:33,279
treat that what if a child suffers from

3664
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:35,240
seizures and we've just begun to

3665
02:23:33,279 --> 02:23:37,200
understand the biological targets but

3666
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:38,800
it's not a sexy subject that VCS are

3667
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:41,359
investing in right now because it's not

3668
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:43,279
a validated Target those are the

3669
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:45,279
situations that we like to get involved

3670
02:23:43,279 --> 02:23:47,399
in where we've understood the basic

3671
02:23:45,279 --> 02:23:50,160
biology when we sit down and we do the

3672
02:23:47,399 --> 02:23:54,040
financial models over $700 million of

3673
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:56,040
peak sales opportunities places where um

3674
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:57,560
antibody Therapeutics and other protein

3675
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:59,399
Therapeutics could make a difference

3676
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:01,920
this has to do with manufacturing we can

3677
02:23:59,399 --> 02:24:04,279
talk about that someday and also where

3678
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:07,200
we know that we have uh IP so freedom to

3679
02:24:04,279 --> 02:24:09,479
operate if we you'd be surprised how few

3680
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:12,000
things meet those criterias but if we

3681
02:24:09,479 --> 02:24:13,760
can do that and then most importantly if

3682
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,439
I can stand in front of you and actually

3683
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:18,880
Define the disease condition we're going

3684
02:24:15,439 --> 02:24:20,720
to be treating so many good ideas cannot

3685
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:23,439
translate because what are you heading

3686
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:25,200
to right so often starting off with the

3687
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:26,960
disease area the problem and then

3688
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:29,640
heading Upstream like the family here is

3689
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:31,520
doing helps us to always remember the

3690
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:33,600
patience right that we're going to

3691
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:36,720
develop a drug that doesn't give people

3692
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:38,640
additional adverse effects so what if we

3693
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:41,120
done in the last two and a half years

3694
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:42,960
also very little sleep um we've built

3695
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:44,600
four companies most of them are stal so

3696
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:46,520
I can't tell you exactly what they do

3697
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:48,920
but I'm very excited because three of

3698
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:51,800
them will be announced this year these

3699
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:54,120
companies have raised over 50 million um

3700
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:56,560
largely led by our most advanced company

3701
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:59,640
we've partnered with uh a Boston Venture

3702
02:24:56,560 --> 02:25:01,319
Capital fund I I I I wish I could I want

3703
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:02,880
to say thank you to one of the gentlemen

3704
02:25:01,319 --> 02:25:05,439
there but when he watches this talk

3705
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:08,279
he'll know it and uh by the summer of

3706
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:10,399
this year it'll be announced um let's

3707
02:25:08,279 --> 02:25:15,040
start from the back so we will often

3708
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:18,080
find a concept 6 months to 18 months we

3709
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:20,439
will front the cash to en license the

3710
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:22,880
technology to build the company to find

3711
02:25:20,439 --> 02:25:25,880
Consultants to find team members that

3712
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:28,960
means that my family liquidated most of

3713
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:30,359
our assets because I had a crazy dream

3714
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:31,880
and when you start to try and build

3715
02:25:30,359 --> 02:25:34,399
something good luck finding someone who

3716
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:36,720
give you money you often have to front

3717
02:25:34,399 --> 02:25:39,800
it so when I moved from California to

3718
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:42,319
Texas um a lot of things were lost a lot

3719
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:44,600
of sacrifices were made and so you know

3720
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:46,800
on the back of that my wonderful family

3721
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:48,040
and friends we've been able to find

3722
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:50,520
these Technologies to build them

3723
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:52,960
in-house and take this forward

3724
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:55,880
then when an idea when we decide to pull

3725
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:57,680
the trigger when we understand that um

3726
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:59,439
we even have conversations with farmer

3727
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:01,439
far in advance understanding who will

3728
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:04,160
buy this company and take it to the

3729
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:06,080
world once we are sure that we can meet

3730
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:08,479
those criteria once we know who the

3731
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:10,200
customer is and that I speak to patients

3732
02:26:08,479 --> 02:26:12,160
to Physicians and they said yeah if the

3733
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:15,000
drug did even half of that yeah I'll

3734
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:17,240
take it then we really start to go on

3735
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:20,520
the road to find real money and you know

3736
02:26:17,240 --> 02:26:22,399
what's more difficult than finding money

3737
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:23,920
great talent that's gonna run it because

3738
02:26:22,399 --> 02:26:25,520
you know they actually ask tough

3739
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:28,720
questions they're like so I've got my

3740
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:30,800
great job at sanofi or fisa or something

3741
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:32,439
why should I leave that great job and I

3742
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:35,120
come work with you have you figured out

3743
02:26:32,439 --> 02:26:36,760
the science what are the risks walk me

3744
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:39,240
through it nah that's not true go look

3745
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:41,479
at that go look at this so I'm very

3746
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:43,720
excited that for for for our companies

3747
02:26:41,479 --> 02:26:46,279
that we build the conversations are very

3748
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:47,760
intensive it's often over dinner but

3749
02:26:46,279 --> 02:26:49,640
generally people say yes this is

3750
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:51,359
something they want to get involved in

3751
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:53,720
I've jumped into the Helm of t-map

3752
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:55,359
Therapeutics and oncology company uh a

3753
02:26:53,720 --> 02:26:57,680
partnership with MD Anderson as its

3754
02:26:55,359 --> 02:27:01,319
co-founder and CEO let's dive deeper

3755
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:03,439
into that as an example of what happens

3756
02:27:01,319 --> 02:27:04,960
do do you understand what is happening

3757
02:27:03,439 --> 02:27:08,720
here who

3758
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:08,720
knows uh please could you

3759
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:16,240
share canc sorry cancer there we go it's

3760
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:18,439
it's finishing your chemotherapy course

3761
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:21,880
we hope you've beaten it but but it's a

3762
02:27:18,439 --> 02:27:24,479
it's a big moment um so the scientist

3763
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:26,960
here Professor Neil sud and jishan an

3764
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:29,960
identified that there were Escape

3765
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:32,040
Pathways to anti vef drugs and anti

3766
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:33,640
drugs are anti-angiogenic agents that

3767
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:35,920
stop blood vessel growth into solid

3768
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:37,319
tumors they can also be used in the eye

3769
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,399
but the problem is they haven't

3770
02:27:37,319 --> 02:27:40,680
generated overall survival benefit

3771
02:27:39,399 --> 02:27:42,760
they've generated progression free

3772
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:45,200
survival benefit which means that VCS

3773
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:47,279
won't fund that because unless if you

3774
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:49,359
can demonstrate that a single drug in a

3775
02:27:47,279 --> 02:27:51,240
trial beats everything else and can

3776
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:52,600
demonstrate overall survival benefit

3777
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:54,880
they're just not going to fund it right

3778
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:57,000
CU otherwise it's Russian Roulette and

3779
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:59,399
we can't do that with pension fund money

3780
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:01,399
so these two scientists worked for years

3781
02:27:59,399 --> 02:28:04,520
trying to understand how women with

3782
02:28:01,399 --> 02:28:07,920
ovarian cancer which is a rare disease

3783
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:10,720
um needed new Therapeutics That Could

3784
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:13,359
That Could demonstrate um overall

3785
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:15,439
survival benefit in that field and

3786
02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:16,840
despite the fancy drugs we come up with

3787
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:19,439
some of you in this room were involved

3788
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:22,520
in that par Inhibitors uh that that are

3789
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:24,880
used in 50 % 50% of women with ovarian

3790
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:27,760
cancer eligible for that despite the

3791
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:29,479
great new antibody drug conjugates that

3792
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:32,880
have been developed that only qualify

3793
02:28:29,479 --> 02:28:36,080
for 30 30 to 40% of the women who have

3794
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:38,120
recurrent Platinum ovarian cancer we

3795
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:39,800
still have this huge group of women who

3796
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:41,040
have Platinum resistant ovarian cancer

3797
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:43,840
and you know what's common across all

3798
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:46,040
the lines of therapy that not so sexy

3799
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:47,080
drug that doesn't do much what people

3800
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:50,120
say

3801
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:52,600
bab very important drug and when you

3802
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:55,600
speak to the to the Physicians they say

3803
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:58,399
it's a great drug we we use it in some

3804
02:28:55,600 --> 02:29:00,640
women for 9 to 18 months we can keep

3805
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:02,479
using it when all the other drugs fail

3806
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:03,800
what can we do about it but I go and

3807
02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:06,800
speak to VCS and they say they don't

3808
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:08,279
care about it so last year after these

3809
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:10,439
scientists have been working on this for

3810
02:29:08,279 --> 02:29:12,600
15 years they published in nature a

3811
02:29:10,439 --> 02:29:16,960
phenomenal publication demonstrating

3812
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:18,319
that the reason why uh ca25 goes up when

3813
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:21,439
patients are now on

3814
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:25,240
bmab um and the their continuation

3815
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:27,000
treatment in recurrent ovarian cancer is

3816
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:28,720
because of these two novel secreted

3817
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:31,160
lians that are over expressed very

3818
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:33,240
similar to vef and they mapped out the

3819
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:35,240
transcriptional pathways that involved

3820
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:37,399
in these being overexpressed and leading

3821
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:39,720
to New Blood vascul growth and immune

3822
02:29:37,399 --> 02:29:42,000
cells growing and what we've been doing

3823
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:44,279
as a company um is building

3824
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:47,120
multi-specific antibodies that can

3825
02:29:44,279 --> 02:29:51,439
Target anti Pathways while targeting

3826
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:53,600
anti cd5l and anti-fl 6 and stimulating

3827
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:55,040
an immune response um over the next

3828
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,920
coming weeks you'll see us more in

3829
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:59,560
Boston there'll be an announcement about

3830
02:29:56,920 --> 02:30:01,760
what we're doing but um I I want to say

3831
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:03,359
um thank you to to to our competitors

3832
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,439
who have paved the way Summit

3833
02:30:03,359 --> 02:30:07,399
Therapeutics in AO have developed a b

3834
02:30:05,439 --> 02:30:10,720
specific that's going to transform the

3835
02:30:07,399 --> 02:30:12,520
cancer space anti vef plus anti pd1 it's

3836
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:16,080
demonstrating 50% progression free

3837
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:18,479
survival benefit uh versus pism AB which

3838
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:20,680
is just astonishing uh in a phase three

3839
02:30:18,479 --> 02:30:23,160
head-to-head trial in China and MD

3840
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:24,560
Anderson is is helping to FastTrack the

3841
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:27,000
approval of that drug in the United

3842
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:30,040
States by running a large phase three so

3843
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:32,800
what do we do we found talented people

3844
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:34,640
heren who headed up antibody engineering

3845
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:36,920
and discovered astroica came out of

3846
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:39,479
retirement his wife is not very happy

3847
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:41,880
with him and he helps us late at night

3848
02:30:39,479 --> 02:30:44,520
to engineer or try specific antibodies

3849
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:47,319
Rakesh who's like a mentor and dad to me

3850
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:50,120
um he used to head up uh animal studies

3851
02:30:47,319 --> 02:30:51,520
at astroica and oncology and you know he

3852
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:53,920
acts like a mentor he makes sure I don't

3853
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:56,120
do dumb things um and and he's our

3854
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:58,680
fractional Chief scientific officer we

3855
02:30:56,120 --> 02:31:00,600
also have a ton of Partners uh who work

3856
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:03,000
with story companies like Johnson

3857
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:04,800
Johnson orenic and genmab I can't tell

3858
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,640
you who those are but they're really

3859
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:09,600
good at what they do and yet I still

3860
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:11,560
stress them out because of my demands um

3861
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:14,680
and this is what we're dreaming of We're

3862
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:17,680
Dreaming that of that if we can raise 50

3863
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:21,319
million over the next over the next uh

3864
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:23,880
24 months we'll be able to run uh two

3865
02:31:21,319 --> 02:31:26,760
phase one trials at MD Anderson one with

3866
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:31,359
our super avastin drug which combines

3867
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:33,720
cd5l VF and egfl6 in tumors that respond

3868
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:35,319
to anti-f drugs but need an additional

3869
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:38,359
kick of immune activation that's what

3870
02:31:35,319 --> 02:31:40,319
cd5l does makes macras start to make

3871
02:31:38,359 --> 02:31:42,760
inflammatory cyto kindes recruits tea

3872
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:44,520
cells with our other multi-specific

3873
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:46,560
antibody construct that has a checkpoint

3874
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:48,840
inhibitor component to it we want to

3875
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:51,120
Target cancers that have responded to to

3876
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:52,960
checkpoint inhibitors but you know could

3877
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:55,479
need an additional boost things like

3878
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:58,080
microsatellite stable choral cancer

3879
02:31:55,479 --> 02:32:00,160
where we've had a lot of difficulty so

3880
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:03,240
that's it in a nutshell we could apply

3881
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:06,200
to all of these Cancers and this is why

3882
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:08,080
we get the companies to phase one we

3883
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:10,520
start the relationships with farmer and

3884
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:13,439
then we say we can do this as a small

3885
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:15,680
biotech the right thing for patients is

3886
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:17,399
to hand over the technology to Great

3887
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:19,399
teams that can run the trials around the

3888
02:32:17,399 --> 02:32:21,359
world and get these drugs to patients as

3889
02:32:19,399 --> 02:32:23,720
quickly as POS possible we do do the

3890
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:29,120
numbers this is an example of the peak

3891
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:31,359
sales opportunity uh for a for a um a

3892
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:34,080
trip specific construct that would be uh

3893
02:32:31,359 --> 02:32:35,560
looking at nons small cell and cancer

3894
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:37,840
and that said I think what I want to

3895
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:40,279
show you is we're very busy uh we're

3896
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:43,200
building teams for our other portfolio

3897
02:32:40,279 --> 02:32:45,120
companies and this is the tough thing if

3898
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:47,000
you want to learn how to build a company

3899
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:49,479
please speak to me happy to be your

3900
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:52,120
friend and maybe one day when you do it

3901
02:32:49,479 --> 02:32:53,479
I'll be there cheering you on and uh we

3902
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:55,160
we can work together through this

3903
02:32:53,479 --> 02:32:56,680
structure so thank you very much for

3904
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:58,840
your time these are all the wonderful

3905
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:00,640
people who help us and uh all the

3906
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:03,240
partners who've made it possible who

3907
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:05,279
took a bet on our company gave us

3908
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:06,600
massive discounts to get going and

3909
02:33:05,279 --> 02:33:08,680
that's the truth that's how these things

3910
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:12,600
start is people take a beted on you so

3911
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:12,600
thank you so much for your time

3912
02:33:14,930 --> 02:33:18,489
[Applause]

3913
02:33:20,359 --> 02:33:23,200
no questions

3914
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:30,350
[Applause]

3915
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:36,720
good our next talk is going to shift our

3916
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:39,120
lens a little bit so we are going to

3917
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:41,800
hear from Bart who is from the

3918
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:46,399
Netherlands and he's going to talk to us

3919
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:50,279
a bit more about how he uses AI to

3920
02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:52,279
facilitate both um care delivery and

3921
02:33:50,279 --> 02:33:53,640
Drug development through his work in the

3922
02:33:52,279 --> 02:33:55,359
Netherlands so we'll get to see a little

3923
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:58,359
bit about how he thinks about how an

3924
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:59,560
academic Medical Center can fit into all

3925
02:33:58,359 --> 02:34:01,680
of the innovations that we've heard

3926
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:05,240
about

3927
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:06,840
today thank you Katherine and what a

3928
02:34:05,240 --> 02:34:09,439
what a wonderful program you've

3929
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:12,200
developed I'm so uh proud to be part of

3930
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:14,880
it and a little bit anxious to be

3931
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:18,520
following such great great great

3932
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:20,600
speeches um and when I when I what I

3933
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:24,399
want to present today is really

3934
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:29,439
uh of course AI is a sort of a catalyst

3935
02:34:24,399 --> 02:34:32,319
u a catalyst through uh uh which can

3936
02:34:29,439 --> 02:34:34,479
enable a Health Care system to adopt all

3937
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:36,800
this great research and all these great

3938
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:39,040
companies and this development into

3939
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:41,560
something that actually uh reaches the

3940
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:45,479
patients at scale so I want to talk

3941
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:47,560
about an enabling ecosystem and um as

3942
02:34:45,479 --> 02:34:50,640
mentioned I'm from the Netherland so

3943
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:54,479
it's closest to uh my home to talk about

3944
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:58,960
the Dutch ecosystem uh and U yeah I I'll

3945
02:34:54,479 --> 02:35:00,720
elaborate a bit about that um so I'm

3946
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:03,760
currently employed by the University

3947
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:05,800
Medical Center in koning um my main role

3948
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:08,240
there is to develop our corporate AI

3949
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:10,120
strategy which covers both the medical

3950
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:11,720
side but also the research and the

3951
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:14,680
educational

3952
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:17,080
sides uh I'm also the the president of

3953
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:18,720
the Dutch Clinical Research Foundation

3954
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:20,359
and I'll I'll talk a little bit about

3955
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:23,520
that as well because it's an important

3956
02:35:20,359 --> 02:35:25,520
step to this enabling uh

3957
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:26,880
ecosystem uh I also want to talk a

3958
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:28,760
little bit about you know more the

3959
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:29,800
European perspective or the larger

3960
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:34,000
European

3961
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:37,880
ecosystem and um yeah finally dive into

3962
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:43,399
a few examples of the applications of AI

3963
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:46,000
in a medical uh system or a medical in a

3964
02:35:43,399 --> 02:35:47,640
hospital so first of all the the Dutch

3965
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,200
Clinical Research Foundation which I

3966
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:53,240
currently chair um if if you want to

3967
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:55,279
develop new uh agents and bring them

3968
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:58,080
into uh into Healthcare of course

3969
02:35:55,279 --> 02:35:59,600
research is a key component and in the

3970
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:02,840
Dutch Clinical Research Foundation we

3971
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:04,720
really align Partners in research uh to

3972
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:07,040
make sure that the process is as

3973
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:09,840
efficient as possible so first of all

3974
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:12,479
there's uh the researchers themselves or

3975
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:14,479
the clinicians themselves the the Dutch

3976
02:36:12,479 --> 02:36:16,160
academic hospitals and the larger

3977
02:36:14,479 --> 02:36:19,800
hospital system they're all

3978
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:22,120
collaborating uh together in in the dcrf

3979
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:25,760
we also have industry so the Innovative

3980
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:28,160
Pharma uh the C are also part of the the

3981
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:29,720
foundation our Regulators so the the

3982
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:32,479
Central Committee for human bound

3983
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:35,439
research the the Dutch medical ethics

3984
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:37,040
committees and also a a research funding

3985
02:36:35,439 --> 02:36:40,560
uh uh

3986
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:42,800
entity and they're part of a a larger

3987
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:44,800
connected ecosystem and that's how we

3988
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:47,680
see the Nelons as well it's a really

3989
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:50,040
condensed small country uh

3990
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:52,560
geographically it inhabits about 18

3991
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:54,560
million people uh but it's really well

3992
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:56,640
connected it's well connected in terms

3993
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:58,359
of data infrastructures it's also well

3994
02:36:56,640 --> 02:37:00,439
connected in terms of physical

3995
02:36:58,359 --> 02:37:03,479
infrastructures and it's part it's

3996
02:37:00,439 --> 02:37:05,319
really Central to uh to Europe we also

3997
02:37:03,479 --> 02:37:07,319
house the European medicines agency as

3998
02:37:05,319 --> 02:37:11,359
well as the European pent

3999
02:37:07,319 --> 02:37:14,000
office so some anxiety exists around

4000
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:15,720
Europe being a really difficult place to

4001
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,120
bring your research to especially if you

4002
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:21,040
want to skill because it's of course not

4003
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:23,560
one country it is is uh many different

4004
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:26,560
countries but what is the interesting

4005
02:37:23,560 --> 02:37:29,920
thing about that is that in Europe we we

4006
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:32,040
have a habit of collaboration because uh

4007
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:33,680
because of the the fact that we uh we

4008
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:37,720
have many different countries in in one

4009
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:42,520
legal economic entity so on the left you

4010
02:37:37,720 --> 02:37:44,279
see that in uh General more and more uh

4011
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:47,600
commercial research is being done in

4012
02:37:44,279 --> 02:37:49,160
single countries so one country uh and

4013
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:50,399
and all your eggs in that one basket

4014
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:52,399
let's say

4015
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:55,479
especially with China but also here in

4016
02:37:52,399 --> 02:37:57,960
the US it is a more common practice and

4017
02:37:55,479 --> 02:38:00,479
over time you see a trend that it it it

4018
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:02,960
becomes more more common whereas in

4019
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:05,439
Europe uh increasingly we are doing

4020
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:06,880
multinational studies especially since

4021
02:38:05,439 --> 02:38:10,439
the introduction of the clinical trial

4022
02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:12,760
regulation that has been much more the

4023
02:38:10,439 --> 02:38:16,600
case and also if you look at you know

4024
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:20,200
the total volume of of of studies uh

4025
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:26,439
continuously the European economic uh

4026
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:30,479
entity area has been uh well U uh

4027
02:38:26,439 --> 02:38:33,080
positioned to do multi multicountry

4028
02:38:30,479 --> 02:38:35,800
studies and increasingly there are

4029
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:40,160
Advanced Therapies in those studies so

4030
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:42,279
over 15% of these studies are uh using

4031
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:46,279
uh Advanced therapies and I think that's

4032
02:38:42,279 --> 02:38:49,600
good news for the rare disease space

4033
02:38:46,279 --> 02:38:51,600
because I think nowhere uh else it is

4034
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:54,319
more common that advanced therapies are

4035
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:56,560
used as in the rare disease space and

4036
02:38:54,319 --> 02:38:58,880
there's a clear reason why and and this

4037
02:38:56,560 --> 02:39:02,160
is a hashtag that was introduced in uh

4038
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:05,680
in Europe a few years ago uh it says 30

4039
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:07,800
million reasons which uh represents to

4040
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:10,479
30 million patients of rare diseases in

4041
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:12,399
the in Europe and um actually some

4042
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:15,399
studies show that it might be as as high

4043
02:39:12,399 --> 02:39:18,399
as 36 million and that's twice the

4044
02:39:15,399 --> 02:39:20,040
population size of the Netherlands um so

4045
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:22,160
and these patients can't weight so this

4046
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:23,840
is this is something that we uh we

4047
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:25,920
really need to focus on and one of the

4048
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:28,359
great ways to do that in a European

4049
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:30,479
context is through the European

4050
02:39:28,359 --> 02:39:32,520
reference networks I don't know if

4051
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:34,680
you've uh heard about these before but

4052
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:37,000
the European reference networks bring

4053
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:40,760
together patients uh healthc care

4054
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:42,840
institutions Academia uh around certain

4055
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:45,520
rare diseases and in the Netherlands

4056
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:47,600
we've been uh really focused on

4057
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:49,800
promoting uh participation in the

4058
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:52,200
European reference Networks so out of

4059
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:55,200
the 24 that were established in

4060
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:58,840
2017 uh seven are actually coordinated

4061
02:39:55,200 --> 02:40:01,920
by Dutch uh uh Specialists and we

4062
02:39:58,840 --> 02:40:03,720
participate in in nearly all of them and

4063
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:06,040
it's a a really fantastic way of

4064
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:10,160
knowledge sharing and expertise sharing

4065
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:15,359
and it really allows us to quickly U uh

4066
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:15,359
go to a a paneuropean u uh

4067
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:20,960
collaboration on a more Dutch scale we

4068
02:40:18,439 --> 02:40:23,279
have also invested in rare andl and rare

4069
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:26,640
andl is a organization that brings

4070
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:29,479
together Academia um Healthcare

4071
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:32,560
professionals but also industry around

4072
02:40:29,479 --> 02:40:34,359
rare diseases and Drug repurposing so

4073
02:40:32,560 --> 02:40:37,600
this is a a hub really for the

4074
02:40:34,359 --> 02:40:40,720
development where uh we we work together

4075
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:40,720
uh from these different

4076
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:49,880
disciplines some of the um work that was

4077
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:52,640
done um

4078
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:56,720
well I I I won't go to into much detail

4079
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:58,040
there sorry so um this Dutch ecosystem

4080
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:59,840
the way it works is we have our

4081
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:02,800
University Medical Centers there are

4082
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:04,840
seven and they this is really a system

4083
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:06,720
of collaboration that we have over

4084
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:09,520
80,000 people are employed in those

4085
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:12,920
institutions about 12 billion turnover

4086
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:14,720
every year uh and U uh yeah most of the

4087
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:17,160
science actually is developed there most

4088
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:20,200
of the rare disease specialists are

4089
02:41:17,160 --> 02:41:21,720
there and then there there is also other

4090
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:24,160
infrastructures so for instance health

4091
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:26,439
arai is really about aligning data

4092
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:28,359
infrastructures Across the Nation to

4093
02:41:26,439 --> 02:41:31,960
make sure that we have those data that

4094
02:41:28,359 --> 02:41:34,080
we need to do uh research and Innovation

4095
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:36,600
and also we have some different uh

4096
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:39,040
organizations such as rnl but also the

4097
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:41,200
Dutch Center for RNA Therapeutics which

4098
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:45,760
you may be familiar with who really

4099
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:48,520
support the work in this uh rare disease

4100
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:49,920
space now some of the examples from a

4101
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:51,640
more clinical

4102
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:54,800
approach and this is not something that

4103
02:41:51,640 --> 02:41:57,240
we yet do in rare diseases space but we

4104
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:59,960
are sort of trying to see how especially

4105
02:41:57,240 --> 02:42:02,880
generative AI is helping our uh Health

4106
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:05,439
Care system and uh those examples I I

4107
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:08,359
think we we we can later expand into the

4108
02:42:05,439 --> 02:42:12,880
the rare disease space so if you look at

4109
02:42:08,359 --> 02:42:14,439
AI in a you uh in a single Hospital the

4110
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:16,399
way we approach it when we look at this

4111
02:42:14,439 --> 02:42:18,080
technology we think of of different

4112
02:42:16,399 --> 02:42:19,760
value streams that we can use this

4113
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:23,080
technology the first one being

4114
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:26,399
efficiency which is quite quite uh easy

4115
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:29,000
to identify so use AI to reduce

4116
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:31,000
administrative burden for instance uh

4117
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:32,399
then AI for Discovery I think a lot of

4118
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:34,359
the work that's being done especially

4119
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:36,399
here in the broad Institute is about AI

4120
02:42:34,359 --> 02:42:38,120
for Discovery or you know the machine

4121
02:42:36,399 --> 02:42:40,680
learning or the Deep learning that

4122
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:43,000
that's already been uh explored for many

4123
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:45,640
decades but also now with the generative

4124
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:47,080
AI uh then the AI for precision I think

4125
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:49,640
that's where it becomes more interesting

4126
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:50,399
because for instance we uh use a a

4127
02:42:49,640 --> 02:42:52,880
project that's called the

4128
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:56,200
pharmacogenetic passport where uh

4129
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:59,080
through uh Gene testing and multimodal

4130
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:01,399
data approaches we can find and identify

4131
02:42:59,080 --> 02:43:04,040
unique therapies for individual patients

4132
02:43:01,399 --> 02:43:06,399
and AI is really supporting us there and

4133
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:07,720
the last one is AI for augmentation and

4134
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:09,240
there you I think you should really

4135
02:43:07,720 --> 02:43:11,840
think about also the patients

4136
02:43:09,240 --> 02:43:14,920
perspective in this one so imagine you

4137
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:16,760
being at your physician he or she is

4138
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:19,399
telling you all about you know your

4139
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:22,040
disease your therapy and the things that

4140
02:43:19,399 --> 02:43:24,640
are ahead of you and and AI can really

4141
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:26,520
help us by for instance taking that

4142
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:29,520
information and then relaying it to the

4143
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:32,960
patient in a really um understandable

4144
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:36,160
and and U uh easy accessible language

4145
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:38,200
for instance so we're actually doing a

4146
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:41,200
lot of work of on that and I'll skip

4147
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:43,200
this one um so what we've done is we've

4148
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:45,080
really developed a framework in our in

4149
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:46,680
our Healthcare institution uh We've

4150
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:48,760
looked at you know what are the unique

4151
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:50,800
challenges uh that generative AI bring

4152
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:53,640
to us in terms of for instance bias

4153
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:55,840
medication uh we heard hallucinations or

4154
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:57,960
confabulations in in one of the previous

4155
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:59,960
presentations as well but also things

4156
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:03,120
like liability how does it work if such

4157
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:06,000
a system fails or if it makes mistakes

4158
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:08,479
so we've we've generated this framework

4159
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:10,000
we've we've developed a team that that

4160
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:12,200
you know brings together all the key

4161
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:14,080
expertises that we need and based on

4162
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:16,000
that we've we've done a pipeline of

4163
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:18,200
different uh use cases that we've

4164
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:20,960
introduced so that's for instance

4165
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:23,479
helping our doctors getting a a draft

4166
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:26,120
response to the patient's questions uh

4167
02:44:23,479 --> 02:44:28,000
but also an AI text assistant that helps

4168
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:31,279
doctors draft patient accessible

4169
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:33,080
language in their discharge notes uh and

4170
02:44:31,279 --> 02:44:35,240
some other functionalities so we

4171
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:36,800
currently have eight functionalities in

4172
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:39,720
in clinic

4173
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:42,160
today and then the next uh Frontier for

4174
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:44,160
us is normal typing and that's really

4175
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:46,080
about the ambient listening so listening

4176
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:48,359
into the clinical conversation moving

4177
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:50,439
that into high contextual text and then

4178
02:44:48,359 --> 02:44:52,240
into high quality quity data and I think

4179
02:44:50,439 --> 02:44:53,800
therefore the rare disease space is

4180
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:57,200
going to really open up because if we

4181
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:59,200
are able to do that go from uh a

4182
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:02,000
discussion in clinic into high

4183
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:04,479
contextual text into high quality data

4184
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,760
we can start exploring for new avenues

4185
02:45:04,479 --> 02:45:10,960
to identify patients for instance

4186
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:13,680
through uh U uh symptoms that they

4187
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:15,600
describe during those

4188
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:17,359
conversations of course this is all

4189
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:18,640
being done in a context where you know

4190
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:20,520
it's really important that we also

4191
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:22,920
consider the ethical legal and societal

4192
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:26,040
aspects and for that reason we've

4193
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:29,279
established the elza AI lab which you

4194
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:30,760
know focuses on this specific part of of

4195
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:33,640
the introduction of this

4196
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:35,880
technology um and and there we really

4197
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:38,319
want to understand if for instance you

4198
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:40,040
only ask a lawyer whether something can

4199
02:45:38,319 --> 02:45:42,439
happen or if you only ask somebody who

4200
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:44,560
is really involved in privacy aspects

4201
02:45:42,439 --> 02:45:46,560
then the answer might be too black and

4202
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:48,040
white and if we can do that from a a

4203
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:50,359
more framework perspective on the

4204
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:52,200
ethical legal and societal aspects I

4205
02:45:50,359 --> 02:45:54,880
think a lot more can be done with that

4206
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:59,080
data and I think that also opens up the

4207
02:45:54,880 --> 02:46:01,160
patients perspective U uh from this

4208
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:03,160
technology and and the reason I I

4209
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:06,560
mentioned that so in in chronia we we

4210
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:09,040
actually have an mosis expertise Center

4211
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:12,279
and um when you look at patients that

4212
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:15,560
come in with this uh destructive disease

4213
02:46:12,279 --> 02:46:17,840
which is really rare by the way um the

4214
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:20,960
most one of the very common complaints

4215
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:23,399
is that they have is num feet and there

4216
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:26,920
are so many reasons why you could have

4217
02:46:23,399 --> 02:46:28,920
num feet but um if you look at family

4218
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:30,960
history for instance patients with mlo

4219
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:33,439
dosis typically have a strong genetic

4220
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:36,279
predisposition so they will have uh a

4221
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:38,279
lot of history in their family with such

4222
02:46:36,279 --> 02:46:40,760
complaints and if that could only help

4223
02:46:38,279 --> 02:46:43,760
us to more quickly identify and and

4224
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:45,439
diagnose those patients and ensure that

4225
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:48,040
you know the the damage that is done by

4226
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:50,399
this disease is uh is captured early

4227
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:53,040
then then I think we have a lot to

4228
02:46:50,399 --> 02:46:56,000
win so I have one last and I'm looking

4229
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:58,479
at the time one last um example that I

4230
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:02,080
wanted to to uh to

4231
02:46:58,479 --> 02:47:04,640
give and that's the uh genome met for

4232
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:07,319
all and um actually this is the work

4233
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:09,399
that's done um a follow-up project that

4234
02:47:07,319 --> 02:47:11,560
was done by edart F beers from the the

4235
02:47:09,399 --> 02:47:14,680
UT University Medical Center so that's

4236
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:17,960
another uh hospital and what they have

4237
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:19,640
actually been able to do is to to model

4238
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:22,560
through Federated learning through

4239
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:24,760
synthetic data uh something for Cle cell

4240
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:28,520
disease that you know enables them to

4241
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:31,960
identify new patients on a quicker scale

4242
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:34,399
and this is led by the uh Euro blood net

4243
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:35,800
which is one of the erns and I think

4244
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:37,880
that that shows that you know there's

4245
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:39,160
really hope for those patients in those

4246
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:42,960
rare

4247
02:47:39,160 --> 02:47:45,560
diseases and um yeah maybe still a last

4248
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:47,720
one last month uh a paper was uh

4249
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:49,680
published in in nature medicine about

4250
02:47:47,720 --> 02:47:52,319
solve Rd

4251
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:54,120
um and this is a network where actually

4252
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:57,319
from about 6 and a half thousand

4253
02:47:54,120 --> 02:47:59,600
patients that had you know un un diagnos

4254
02:47:57,319 --> 02:48:01,319
where diseases uh they bring they

4255
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:03,680
brought together you know pulled

4256
02:48:01,319 --> 02:48:06,240
together a lot of data they pulled

4257
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:08,880
together expertise from different uh

4258
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:11,439
European reference networks and then

4259
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:13,040
through this project they re-evaluated

4260
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:15,920
those 6 and a half thousand patients and

4261
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:19,200
were're able to identify over 500

4262
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:21,240
patients U or diagnose over 500 patient

4263
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:23,399
with a rare disease and I think that

4264
02:48:21,240 --> 02:48:26,479
goes to show that that that technology

4265
02:48:23,399 --> 02:48:29,520
really helps us to U uh move forward in

4266
02:48:26,479 --> 02:48:32,200
the rare disase space so to Briefly

4267
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:34,040
summarize and I hope U have been able to

4268
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:36,880
relay my message

4269
02:48:34,040 --> 02:48:38,520
properly um I'm not trying to promote

4270
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:40,399
the Nelons here but I think it's good to

4271
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:43,520
look at it from an ecosystem perspective

4272
02:48:40,399 --> 02:48:45,279
so how from all that important research

4273
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:46,520
how do we actually bring it to patient

4274
02:48:45,279 --> 02:48:49,439
and and that's really through a

4275
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:52,600
collaboration in the ecosystem both in a

4276
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:53,920
national perspective but also uh from a

4277
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:57,439
European

4278
02:48:53,920 --> 02:48:59,040
perspective um the the drug repurposing

4279
02:48:57,439 --> 02:49:00,920
was mentioned a few times during the

4280
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:02,960
presentations and in the nland we really

4281
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:04,800
feel that that's a really high potential

4282
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:07,880
because it brings to together to the

4283
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:09,880
patient therapies today rather than uh

4284
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:12,120
10 years down the line which I don't

4285
02:49:09,880 --> 02:49:14,640
want to make an argument for that we

4286
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:17,080
stop doing that Innovative work but look

4287
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:20,160
at what we already have I think we

4288
02:49:17,080 --> 02:49:22,640
should really uh get experience in using

4289
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:25,840
those AI models in healthcare in general

4290
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:29,479
so not just the most advanced models but

4291
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:31,720
also everyday uh applications so for

4292
02:49:29,479 --> 02:49:35,200
instance browsing through patient data

4293
02:49:31,720 --> 02:49:37,880
to find new patterns um yeah and lastly

4294
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:40,359
and I think this is um something where

4295
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:43,200
the the uh Massachusetts area and the

4296
02:49:40,359 --> 02:49:45,600
Nelons have already you know have have a

4297
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:47,160
long-standing relation this model of

4298
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:50,200
collaboration which is really part of

4299
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:52,399
the DNA of this ecosystem and it's also

4300
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:55,319
very much the uh the DNA of our

4301
02:49:52,399 --> 02:49:58,520
ecosystem in the Netherlands so leading

4302
02:49:55,319 --> 02:50:01,670
by example uh I think is a key work and

4303
02:49:58,520 --> 02:50:07,000
with that I I want to thank you for your

4304
02:50:01,670 --> 02:50:09,960
[Applause]

4305
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:12,880
attention questions for Bart I have a

4306
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:15,319
question um I'm curious about your

4307
02:50:12,880 --> 02:50:18,680
impressions from from your Vantage Point

4308
02:50:15,319 --> 02:50:21,439
um as to the uh potential for collab

4309
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:23,239
operation between the EMA and the FDA in

4310
02:50:21,439 --> 02:50:25,479
the context of rare diseases what have

4311
02:50:23,239 --> 02:50:28,479
you seen what do you see as challenges

4312
02:50:25,479 --> 02:50:30,840
or opportunities uh in terms of those uh

4313
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:33,760
interactions yeah thank you for the

4314
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:37,239
question and um

4315
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:39,399
um I I don't know the extent to which

4316
02:50:37,239 --> 02:50:41,680
these organizations already collaborate

4317
02:50:39,399 --> 02:50:44,680
I know that uh what really helps of

4318
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:46,239
course if uh let's say the ecosystems

4319
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:49,000
themselves collaborate and that The

4320
02:50:46,239 --> 02:50:51,040
Regulators could follow uh over the past

4321
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:53,200
years I've seen positive developments in

4322
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:56,600
terms if you look at for instance from

4323
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:58,359
the US side uh the arpage uh initiative

4324
02:50:56,600 --> 02:51:01,080
which really Fosters collaboration

4325
02:50:58,359 --> 02:51:03,359
between the or transatlantic

4326
02:51:01,080 --> 02:51:05,080
collaborations on the EU side the same

4327
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:07,880
has happened right so especially in the

4328
02:51:05,080 --> 02:51:10,040
health uh research space there's

4329
02:51:07,880 --> 02:51:12,920
opportunities for us counterparts to

4330
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:14,920
collaborate with EU counterparts and I

4331
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:16,880
think if we can you know Foster that

4332
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:19,399
collaboration much more then I think

4333
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:21,200
those Regulators will follow

4334
02:51:19,399 --> 02:51:25,840
I don't know whether they are already in

4335
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:29,760
advanced State uh in in the current

4336
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:29,760
discussions okay okay thank

4337
02:51:31,319 --> 02:51:35,920
you

4338
02:51:33,279 --> 02:51:38,239
so wow what an afternoon I know it's

4339
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:39,920
been long but I think fascinating and I

4340
02:51:38,239 --> 02:51:42,680
just want to give again all of the

4341
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:45,239
speakers a a round of applause for just

4342
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:48,239
incredible stories and scientific

4343
02:51:45,239 --> 02:51:48,239
discoveries

4344
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:54,600
clearly there's a lot to be hopeful for

4345
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:56,920
and a lot more work of course ahead of

4346
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:58,479
us so I know we had like this whole long

4347
02:51:56,920 --> 02:52:00,800
sort of list of questions that we wanted

4348
02:51:58,479 --> 02:52:04,000
to discuss but I also want to keep us um

4349
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:05,760
on time so I just wanted to maybe um you

4350
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,359
know just have a conversation and just

4351
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:09,439
think about you know whoever you know

4352
02:52:07,359 --> 02:52:10,720
feels like sort of jumping in from

4353
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:13,520
everything that we've heard today or

4354
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:15,720
from all the different you know groups

4355
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:17,239
and and and constituencies that you

4356
02:52:15,720 --> 02:52:20,920
represent different stakeholders in the

4357
02:52:17,239 --> 02:52:23,279
field um what would you point as to a

4358
02:52:20,920 --> 02:52:25,319
recent win something that you're really

4359
02:52:23,279 --> 02:52:27,160
sort of positive about you know each

4360
02:52:25,319 --> 02:52:29,479
from your different Vantage points and

4361
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:32,840
whoever you know wants to jump in first

4362
02:52:29,479 --> 02:52:35,880
what what what can we name as a recent

4363
02:52:32,840 --> 02:52:38,840
win I have a couple I'm going to start

4364
02:52:35,880 --> 02:52:41,479
with CTN mb1 uh the disorder that my son

4365
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:44,359
has two things the CTN mb1 connect and

4366
02:52:41,479 --> 02:52:46,000
cure Foundation here in the USA uh

4367
02:52:44,359 --> 02:52:48,720
obviously from fundraising from families

4368
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:50,840
and generous donors around the world uh

4369
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:53,080
has funded uh Michelle Jacob labit tffs

4370
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:56,160
who has partnered with the broad and was

4371
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:58,120
awarded the ncats nah Trend program so

4372
02:52:56,160 --> 02:53:01,120
they will be working to optimize a lead

4373
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:03,960
compound for the disorder my son has and

4374
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:06,120
second our ctb1 foundation in Slovenia

4375
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:08,640
is um well on their way they've

4376
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:10,080
manufactured our aav9 gene therapy and

4377
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:12,760
hoping to go to clinical trials this

4378
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:15,560
fall and to shout out some amazing rare

4379
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:19,040
Advocates out there uh Terry pakis just

4380
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:21,520
appeared on Kelly Clarkson Sunita P was

4381
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:25,319
at the White House speaking and I just

4382
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:27,000
think it's so profound that these rare

4383
02:53:25,319 --> 02:53:28,880
Advocates are showing up and raising

4384
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:31,439
their voice in places that maybe they

4385
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:34,800
don't belong I'm at the road I mean

4386
02:53:31,439 --> 02:53:37,040
people are listening to us and it's it's

4387
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:38,960
it's moving and it's really wonderful

4388
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:40,560
and it's and I'm seeing that the these

4389
02:53:38,960 --> 02:53:41,600
aren't just diseases anymore to people

4390
02:53:40,560 --> 02:53:43,479
and that people are seeing that there's

4391
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:46,080
a community and human beings behind it

4392
02:53:43,479 --> 02:53:50,439
so it's I'm hopeful and I think the

4393
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:50,439
future is bright I love it

4394
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:56,040
yes of

4395
02:53:52,920 --> 02:53:59,399
course so I talked a lot about patient

4396
02:53:56,040 --> 02:54:01,279
insights I want to share one win um for

4397
02:53:59,399 --> 02:54:04,000
one of the partners that we're working

4398
02:54:01,279 --> 02:54:06,840
with global genes weax they are a

4399
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:10,680
patient registry platform they were

4400
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:12,600
recently awarded a 1.5 million Grand

4401
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:15,120
technology Grant from the Cher

4402
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:17,040
Foundation we're also a grantee from the

4403
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:19,720
zzii grant so we're very happy for both

4404
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:21,840
of them they're essentially using AI to

4405
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:25,160
better understand patient data and that

4406
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:28,160
is so powerful because a lot of times

4407
02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:31,359
it's really hard for the patient the

4408
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:33,720
families to fill out pages and hours of

4409
02:54:31,359 --> 02:54:36,359
survey they have all the information for

4410
02:54:33,720 --> 02:54:39,680
years of history but it's just so

4411
02:54:36,359 --> 02:54:42,239
complicated to share all that data with

4412
02:54:39,680 --> 02:54:45,920
your clinician with the researchers I'm

4413
02:54:42,239 --> 02:54:48,760
really excited to to see AI in general

4414
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:53,840
being a tool to capture more patient

4415
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:56,160
insights data stories um as part of

4416
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:57,560
research fascinating yes I think that's

4417
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:59,399
incredible and there are many

4418
02:54:57,560 --> 02:55:01,640
opportunities ahead any more takers

4419
02:54:59,399 --> 02:55:06,359
recent wins any any

4420
02:55:01,640 --> 02:55:09,399
takes um okay fine we'll kind of uh move

4421
02:55:06,359 --> 02:55:13,160
into the next um next uh topic I I was

4422
02:55:09,399 --> 02:55:14,359
just um curious about you know we we

4423
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:17,120
talked a lot today I mean there was a

4424
02:55:14,359 --> 02:55:19,960
mix of of of uh you know scientific and

4425
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:22,439
sort of more uh you know stories from uh

4426
02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:24,520
inspired by your work in advocacy uh

4427
02:55:22,439 --> 02:55:26,359
working with family foundations but the

4428
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:29,120
thing that struck me as a common theme

4429
02:55:26,359 --> 02:55:30,840
you know has been the tools you know

4430
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:32,200
there's there's a need for tools

4431
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:34,120
sometimes there are scientific tools we

4432
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:36,239
discussed the discovery of some of those

4433
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:38,399
and other times there's other tools so

4434
02:55:36,239 --> 02:55:40,520
and then that brings us of course to you

4435
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:43,720
know who has access to these tools and

4436
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:45,399
how do we you know make it better um uh

4437
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:48,319
I know that many of us today talked

4438
02:55:45,399 --> 02:55:50,080
about um you know problems with access

4439
02:55:48,319 --> 02:55:52,439
is how it's Unique that we can all be

4440
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:54,520
here in Boston together um you know

4441
02:55:52,439 --> 02:55:56,720
talking about these topics but you know

4442
02:55:54,520 --> 02:55:58,640
um others who are listening to us and

4443
02:55:56,720 --> 02:56:00,080
and sort of uh uh thinking about all the

4444
02:55:58,640 --> 02:56:01,160
things that we discussed today does it

4445
02:56:00,080 --> 02:56:03,080
sound like something that would be

4446
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:04,479
accessible to them so I'm curious about

4447
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:07,239
how you're thinking about this from your

4448
02:56:04,479 --> 02:56:08,520
different perspectives and uh maybe you

4449
02:56:07,239 --> 02:56:11,160
know what are the tools that you're

4450
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:13,880
focusing on and how you might be uh

4451
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:15,760
securing their uh access to others in

4452
02:56:13,880 --> 02:56:18,880
our broader

4453
02:56:15,760 --> 02:56:20,640
communities any takers well the one of

4454
02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:23,080
the reasons I'm doing my research at the

4455
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:25,560
broad is just this enthusiasm for making

4456
02:56:23,080 --> 02:56:28,160
publicly available tools um not just the

4457
02:56:25,560 --> 02:56:30,359
software not just um the assays and

4458
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:31,960
molecular techniques but also putting

4459
02:56:30,359 --> 02:56:34,359
data into databases and making them

4460
02:56:31,960 --> 02:56:36,800
sharable and doing our very best to make

4461
02:56:34,359 --> 02:56:38,840
them usable by um by everyone

4462
02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:40,120
researchers families clinicians as well

4463
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:41,600
so to me that's a really important part

4464
02:56:40,120 --> 02:56:44,120
of being

4465
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:47,600
here maybe another dimension on the

4466
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:49,840
tools question I think obviously the bro

4467
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:52,479
um does a lot of of work in developing

4468
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:55,640
Innovative tools I hope one of the

4469
02:56:52,479 --> 02:56:59,680
themes we've heard today is how much

4470
02:56:55,640 --> 02:57:02,160
having uh end application a rare disease

4471
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:05,040
or something that you're really working

4472
02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:07,040
towards can help Focus your efforts so

4473
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:09,439
that the tool is something that can be

4474
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:11,200
extensible can be applied because I

4475
02:57:09,439 --> 02:57:12,880
think you know in my day-to-day work at

4476
02:57:11,200 --> 02:57:14,960
thermofisher we do see lots of

4477
02:57:12,880 --> 02:57:17,640
innovative tools come in but not all of

4478
02:57:14,960 --> 02:57:19,359
them have clear applications that can or

4479
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:21,439
are worth being democratized because

4480
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:23,439
there's only a few people at the road

4481
02:57:21,439 --> 02:57:26,040
who could possibly use the tool so part

4482
02:57:23,439 --> 02:57:28,040
of it I think is really partnering with

4483
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:29,920
patients with patient advocacy groups or

4484
02:57:28,040 --> 02:57:32,120
partnering with the end users of these

4485
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:34,359
tools to really understand kind of how

4486
02:57:32,120 --> 02:57:36,560
applicable these are and you know having

4487
02:57:34,359 --> 02:57:39,760
some sort of focus really helps drive to

4488
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:43,920
usefulness and ease of

4489
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:43,920
democratization oh sorry go ahead please

4490
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:49,399
please okay I was also going to say that

4491
02:57:47,239 --> 02:57:51,479
places like Simon light and combined

4492
02:57:49,399 --> 02:57:54,640
brain again are working to gather these

4493
02:57:51,479 --> 02:57:56,239
patients and really think about how

4494
02:57:54,640 --> 02:57:57,760
where the similarities are more than the

4495
02:57:56,239 --> 02:58:00,279
differences and really keeping a pulse

4496
02:57:57,760 --> 02:58:02,960
on the extra motivated Advocates out

4497
02:58:00,279 --> 02:58:04,800
there yeah just just a layer on what you

4498
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:07,080
both said I think the intentionality is

4499
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:08,880
really critical um so all our contracts

4500
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:10,760
our missioners really provide that

4501
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:12,040
access and we'll figure out how to do it

4502
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:14,760
but let's start with assumption that we

4503
02:58:12,040 --> 02:58:16,600
must do that um so for example we share

4504
02:58:14,760 --> 02:58:18,399
all the data back immediately for for

4505
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:20,840
research use we don't blind anything we

4506
02:58:18,399 --> 02:58:22,680
don't take the the best hits off the top

4507
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:24,160
of everything gets shared back because

4508
02:58:22,680 --> 02:58:26,720
we want to advance that research and it

4509
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:28,479
may not be us doing it and that's okay

4510
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:30,640
um and so kind of letting go of that

4511
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:33,319
protective aspect that sometimes has at

4512
02:58:30,640 --> 02:58:35,080
least historically been in the space um

4513
02:58:33,319 --> 02:58:37,560
that's a decision that we made we're not

4514
02:58:35,080 --> 02:58:39,680
going to do that um and we won't get it

4515
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:41,720
right every time but at least having

4516
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:43,120
that kind of guiding principle that you

4517
02:58:41,720 --> 02:58:44,479
know we are in this together and we're

4518
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:45,720
going to solve it together let's start

4519
02:58:44,479 --> 02:58:46,760
with that and then we can figure out

4520
02:58:45,720 --> 02:58:48,439
what we do along the way that's where

4521
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:51,040
all the tools and databases and that

4522
02:58:48,439 --> 02:58:53,200
going take place and maybe just one more

4523
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:55,800
thing to add on there since we are in a

4524
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:57,880
more academic setting here you know one

4525
02:58:55,800 --> 02:59:00,200
of the things we heard when we first

4526
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:02,120
started this rare disease Journey was

4527
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:04,160
how many rare disease groups have

4528
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:06,760
partnered with Academia to develop

4529
02:59:04,160 --> 02:59:09,880
models whether that's Mouse models ipscs

4530
02:59:06,760 --> 02:59:11,399
Etc and how many of them had difficulty

4531
02:59:09,880 --> 02:59:13,960
just getting the models out of the

4532
02:59:11,399 --> 02:59:18,920
University developed assets hits targets

4533
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:21,960
Etc and I think sometimes the the tech

4534
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:25,120
transfer offices the powers that be view

4535
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:27,319
these assets as having substantial value

4536
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:29,760
before they've been moved out of the

4537
02:59:27,319 --> 02:59:32,279
institution but the reality that anyone

4538
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:34,200
in biotech will tell you is once you

4539
02:59:32,279 --> 02:59:35,720
take it out you still need to plug tens

4540
02:59:34,200 --> 02:59:38,399
of millions of dollars into it before it

4541
02:59:35,720 --> 02:59:40,520
has any value at all and it may not be

4542
02:59:38,399 --> 02:59:42,720
worth anything too so I think there's

4543
02:59:40,520 --> 02:59:45,600
this embedded assumption sometimes that

4544
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:47,120
every asset has huge value coming out of

4545
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:49,399
the institution and there's a big

4546
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:51,680
incentive to just not let things out but

4547
02:59:49,399 --> 02:59:53,560
that substantially slows progress both

4548
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:55,840
in Innovation both in democratizing

4549
02:59:53,560 --> 02:59:58,319
Access and then also for our um patients

4550
02:59:55,840 --> 02:59:59,960
ultimately yeah and I want to follow up

4551
02:59:58,319 --> 03:00:01,680
on that because I think that's sort of

4552
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:03,920
um a theme for the terier fellows which

4553
03:00:01,680 --> 03:00:06,720
I greatly admire in all of you but this

4554
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:09,160
idea of jumping into starting a company

4555
03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:11,479
or or or um you know becoming a CEO of a

4556
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:13,520
company where you know there's not a

4557
03:00:11,479 --> 03:00:15,359
proven business modeling the classical

4558
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:18,080
sense so would you like to speak a

4559
03:00:15,359 --> 03:00:19,560
little bit about that you know yeah so

4560
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:21,399
one of the things that we get dinged on

4561
03:00:19,560 --> 03:00:23,640
by VCS is why are you changing so many

4562
03:00:21,399 --> 03:00:25,080
things at once why not just one thing

4563
03:00:23,640 --> 03:00:26,640
and the whole point is if you want a

4564
03:00:25,080 --> 03:00:28,479
substantial change it's probably not

4565
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:31,040
going to be done by any one little

4566
03:00:28,479 --> 03:00:33,399
change um and so huge credit to the

4567
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:36,239
terier foundation for uh taking a a

4568
03:00:33,399 --> 03:00:39,000
chance at putting me into the the 2024

4569
03:00:36,239 --> 03:00:40,479
fellow group um it's been fantastic and

4570
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I have to say the mentors are really key

4571
03:00:40,479 --> 03:00:43,120
along the way I think Tanashi also

4572
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:45,560
mentioned you know his his mentor

4573
03:00:43,120 --> 03:00:48,200
outside of the program where they're

4574
03:00:45,560 --> 03:00:50,600
taking a chance on you it's not on your

4575
03:00:48,200 --> 03:00:52,520
technology or your business or it's

4576
03:00:50,600 --> 03:00:55,000
somebody thinks that you can change

4577
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:57,200
whatever it is that you're proposing and

4578
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:59,279
all the ter mentors for example go in

4579
03:00:57,200 --> 03:01:00,600
with that assumption and there's not

4580
03:00:59,279 --> 03:01:03,160
this like kneejerk well that's not how

4581
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:04,479
it's done now where if I talk to VCS

4582
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:06,160
it's like every other conversation it's

4583
03:01:04,479 --> 03:01:08,720
like that's not how it's done like well

4584
03:01:06,160 --> 03:01:10,080
yeah and look at the results um that is

4585
03:01:08,720 --> 03:01:12,080
let's try something different it may not

4586
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:13,200
work right it's not guaranteeing that

4587
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:14,359
but the only guarantee of not doing

4588
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:16,160
anything different is you're going to

4589
03:01:14,359 --> 03:01:17,800
get the same thing out um and so that's

4590
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:20,200
where that mentorship and all that comes

4591
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:21,840
in and so absolutely that the ecosystem

4592
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:23,880
driving that support for just take that

4593
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:26,200
shot and see if it works I think it's

4594
03:01:23,880 --> 03:01:27,880
key and Tanasha said you know this the

4595
03:01:26,200 --> 03:01:29,920
greatest challenge is you know finding

4596
03:01:27,880 --> 03:01:32,040
people right like-minded people building

4597
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:34,120
those teams so I'm curious about you

4598
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:36,920
know both from well anyone's perspective

4599
03:01:34,120 --> 03:01:38,479
here really how hard has it been to find

4600
03:01:36,920 --> 03:01:40,920
you know you you told us some elegant

4601
03:01:38,479 --> 03:01:43,239
stories about how you know uh your

4602
03:01:40,920 --> 03:01:44,560
podcast for example or how you have done

4603
03:01:43,239 --> 03:01:46,600
um you have reached out to other

4604
03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:48,479
families to try to build community but

4605
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:50,279
how what are the Challen Alles in terms

4606
03:01:48,479 --> 03:01:52,239
of finding people either people to work

4607
03:01:50,279 --> 03:01:54,200
in your startup or people to work with

4608
03:01:52,239 --> 03:01:58,160
your foundation or both you know in some

4609
03:01:54,200 --> 03:02:00,200
cases they're intertwined so uh how how

4610
03:01:58,160 --> 03:02:04,399
how are those challenges and and how did

4611
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:06,720
you overcome them um yeah I'd say um a

4612
03:02:04,399 --> 03:02:09,359
for a and I it was probably a lot easier

4613
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:10,920
than it was for Fe a decade ago um we're

4614
03:02:09,359 --> 03:02:13,840
lucky that there's institutions like the

4615
03:02:10,920 --> 03:02:16,160
broad institutions like eff's podcast

4616
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:18,319
and you know support from organizations

4617
03:02:16,160 --> 03:02:21,080
like ultr genics who have a boot Camp to

4618
03:02:18,319 --> 03:02:23,080
bring people together so in a lot of

4619
03:02:21,080 --> 03:02:25,560
ways the only reason a and I have been

4620
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:27,120
able to accelerate so quickly is because

4621
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:29,080
of all the groundwork and Foundation

4622
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:31,720
that's been LED now there are still

4623
03:02:29,080 --> 03:02:34,880
challenges I think the pre-clinical path

4624
03:02:31,720 --> 03:02:36,720
for these uh uh rare diseases and ultra

4625
03:02:34,880 --> 03:02:38,479
rare diseases is a lot more clear there

4626
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:40,239
are still a lot of questions to be

4627
03:02:38,479 --> 03:02:42,399
solved in the clinical and Commercial

4628
03:02:40,239 --> 03:02:44,640
stages obviously um whether that's

4629
03:02:42,399 --> 03:02:46,840
manufacturing or trials what have you

4630
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:49,439
many different questions still remain

4631
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:51,960
but at the very least the front end of

4632
03:02:49,439 --> 03:02:53,960
it the network hint is there and there's

4633
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:55,279
a more clear road map than you know of

4634
03:02:53,960 --> 03:02:58,840
course when you

4635
03:02:55,279 --> 03:03:00,760
started I want to add another point that

4636
03:02:58,840 --> 03:03:02,880
may not be directly answered in question

4637
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:05,439
but I've been thinking about that for

4638
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:08,960
our community we're still trying to

4639
03:03:05,439 --> 03:03:11,840
identify more families more Patients Out

4640
03:03:08,960 --> 03:03:14,960
There Our disease was discovered in

4641
03:03:11,840 --> 03:03:17,800
2016 we have 300 families identified

4642
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:19,640
since then and they're mostly children

4643
03:03:17,800 --> 03:03:24,160
and what we're trying to find are more

4644
03:03:19,640 --> 03:03:28,479
families out there and with the use of

4645
03:03:24,160 --> 03:03:30,920
um AI um you know mapping uh facial

4646
03:03:28,479 --> 03:03:32,359
phenotypes to the disease when I was

4647
03:03:30,920 --> 03:03:35,399
listening to your talk I was very

4648
03:03:32,359 --> 03:03:38,640
inspired to think that can we use tools

4649
03:03:35,399 --> 03:03:41,120
and Technologies to find more families

4650
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:43,960
out there not just in the US but around

4651
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:46,040
the world in an easy way so we can

4652
03:03:43,960 --> 03:03:49,479
expand our community and then our

4653
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:51,120
community becomes our our partner in in

4654
03:03:49,479 --> 03:03:54,960
this journey so I think there are many

4655
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:57,880
ways we can accelerate even finding uh

4656
03:03:54,960 --> 03:04:00,000
families in our community as part of the

4657
03:03:57,880 --> 03:04:01,560
equation and maybe just one more Point

4658
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:03,760
building off of that and connecting to

4659
03:04:01,560 --> 03:04:06,160
the access point you made earlier you

4660
03:04:03,760 --> 03:04:08,640
know uh early last year Aiden and I were

4661
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:10,359
lucky to have uh our story and L's story

4662
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:14,760
on the the front page of the Boston

4663
03:04:10,359 --> 03:04:17,920
Globe um through that a mom of another

4664
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:19,840
zttk patient reached out to us they're

4665
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:21,960
the only other zttk family we know of in

4666
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:24,160
the state of Massachusetts they live in

4667
03:04:21,960 --> 03:04:26,040
Springfield Massachusetts and they only

4668
03:04:24,160 --> 03:04:30,160
got their diagnosis last year their son

4669
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:32,000
is aged 12 so I'd say around access you

4670
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:34,760
know they're only a 2-hour drive from

4671
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:36,640
Boston one of the best you know medical

4672
03:04:34,760 --> 03:04:38,680
and scientific centers in the world and

4673
03:04:36,640 --> 03:04:42,200
yet their access to these Technologies

4674
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:45,960
is so limited in a lot of ways even in

4675
03:04:42,200 --> 03:04:49,520
America someone in a rural or exurb um

4676
03:04:45,960 --> 03:04:51,960
area of America may have less access to

4677
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:54,520
whole exom and genome sequencing than

4678
03:04:51,960 --> 03:04:57,160
someone in a major city like Istanbul or

4679
03:04:54,520 --> 03:05:00,160
something like that so we really need

4680
03:04:57,160 --> 03:05:03,040
more um access to these tests you know

4681
03:05:00,160 --> 03:05:05,640
there's a lot of um uh research out

4682
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:07,800
there about how uh it's estimated 20% of

4683
03:05:05,640 --> 03:05:09,800
cereal poy patients actually have a

4684
03:05:07,800 --> 03:05:12,760
genetic disease of some sort like these

4685
03:05:09,800 --> 03:05:16,160
are all very obvious lwh hanging fruit

4686
03:05:12,760 --> 03:05:18,359
to increase testing and just um help

4687
03:05:16,160 --> 03:05:20,080
patients obviously we then to solve the

4688
03:05:18,359 --> 03:05:22,319
problem of you know Finding treatments

4689
03:05:20,080 --> 03:05:23,840
and cures for them but identifying them

4690
03:05:22,319 --> 03:05:25,800
is like the very first problem that

4691
03:05:23,840 --> 03:05:27,000
needs to be solved and that will really

4692
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:29,279
highlight the

4693
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:30,439
problem yeah was now I'll pgy back off

4694
03:05:29,279 --> 03:05:33,239
both of those comments because what I

4695
03:05:30,439 --> 03:05:36,000
was going to say is we need to like look

4696
03:05:33,239 --> 03:05:37,560
at the patients who have passed this

4697
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,880
there at the hospital and have young

4698
03:05:37,560 --> 03:05:40,200
kids and people are worried and

4699
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:41,920
wondering what's wrong but what about

4700
03:05:40,200 --> 03:05:43,600
those grown those grown kids those

4701
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:46,160
adults that have autism epilepsy and

4702
03:05:43,600 --> 03:05:48,600
cerebral paly who were totally missed

4703
03:05:46,160 --> 03:05:50,560
over 35% it's believe believe maybe even

4704
03:05:48,600 --> 03:05:51,960
up to 5050 is that especially the

4705
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:54,600
patients with cerebral poy have a

4706
03:05:51,960 --> 03:05:56,200
genetic ideology and so how do we get

4707
03:05:54,600 --> 03:05:57,520
those genetic tests to those people with

4708
03:05:56,200 --> 03:05:59,880
those umbrella

4709
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:01,640
diagnoses I think we'd find a lot of

4710
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:04,239
rare disease

4711
03:06:01,640 --> 03:06:05,560
patients makes a lot of good sense and

4712
03:06:04,239 --> 03:06:07,920
maybe part of the reason why there

4713
03:06:05,560 --> 03:06:09,960
should be efforts that really um you

4714
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:12,200
know health and rare diseases and

4715
03:06:09,960 --> 03:06:13,800
pediatric diseases affect every state

4716
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:15,479
you know every constituency all around

4717
03:06:13,800 --> 03:06:17,960
the country and of course every country

4718
03:06:15,479 --> 03:06:20,000
around the world so um I I hear your

4719
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:23,040
point about sort of AIS and and making

4720
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:25,840
sure that that's um so now for the last

4721
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:27,680
question for each of you um we are

4722
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:31,000
transported we just celebrated 10 years

4723
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:32,800
for this um um Gathering that we do

4724
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,840
every year here at Broad uh we've been

4725
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:35,520
doing it for the last three years

4726
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:37,520
successfully with the termier foundation

4727
03:06:35,520 --> 03:06:40,000
again very grateful for that now we are

4728
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:41,160
being transported somehow through a

4729
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:44,760
spaceship

4730
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:47,760
perhaps yeah yeah uh to 10 years from

4731
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:50,239
now and I want each of you to tell me

4732
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:52,359
the one thing that you know we have

4733
03:06:50,239 --> 03:06:54,000
learned or achieved or like what does it

4734
03:06:52,359 --> 03:06:56,080
look like in terms of the when you look

4735
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:57,800
out there in terms of the um uh rare

4736
03:06:56,080 --> 03:07:00,560
disease landscape from each of your

4737
03:06:57,800 --> 03:07:02,359
different Vantage points you know 10

4738
03:07:00,560 --> 03:07:05,319
years from now you don't we don't have

4739
03:07:02,359 --> 03:07:06,600
to go in order but if anyone has any any

4740
03:07:05,319 --> 03:07:10,000
first uh

4741
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:12,439
takers yes all right I'll say Precision

4742
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:14,760
medicine is what I want to see happen in

4743
03:07:12,439 --> 03:07:17,080
our talk we talk a lot about the right

4744
03:07:14,760 --> 03:07:19,160
drug for the right patient at the right

4745
03:07:17,080 --> 03:07:21,319
time and let's bring back the right dose

4746
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:23,840
at the right route so I really believe

4747
03:07:21,319 --> 03:07:26,279
that Precision medicine hopefully is

4748
03:07:23,840 --> 03:07:28,840
less than 10 years can really transform

4749
03:07:26,279 --> 03:07:31,960
how we think about treating and

4750
03:07:28,840 --> 03:07:34,160
supporting each individual based on

4751
03:07:31,960 --> 03:07:36,640
their needs because it's not a one size

4752
03:07:34,160 --> 03:07:40,080
fits all as we all know so I am really

4753
03:07:36,640 --> 03:07:40,880
excited to see where this goes and how

4754
03:07:40,080 --> 03:07:44,920
we

4755
03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:47,200
can get the data for that one individual

4756
03:07:44,920 --> 03:07:51,040
and really tailor the drug to that

4757
03:07:47,200 --> 03:07:53,359
specific specific person that's great

4758
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:55,120
any more Visions 10 years from now maybe

4759
03:07:53,359 --> 03:07:57,239
another dimension of that more from an

4760
03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:59,439
industry perspective and another area

4761
03:07:57,239 --> 03:08:02,000
where perhaps Academia can work more

4762
03:07:59,439 --> 03:08:04,239
with industry you know there's a lot of

4763
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:06,880
innovative modalities that have been in

4764
03:08:04,239 --> 03:08:08,840
in in innovated by the broad and other

4765
03:08:06,880 --> 03:08:11,080
institutions the cell therapies the gene

4766
03:08:08,840 --> 03:08:13,120
therapies as anyone who spent time in

4767
03:08:11,080 --> 03:08:14,520
the space knows one of the biggest

4768
03:08:13,120 --> 03:08:16,680
challenges in these spaces is

4769
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:18,520
manufacturing right there's promising

4770
03:08:16,680 --> 03:08:20,439
science but we just can't get the

4771
03:08:18,520 --> 03:08:22,840
manufacturing right I would like to see

4772
03:08:20,439 --> 03:08:25,520
a world where academics work more with

4773
03:08:22,840 --> 03:08:27,439
industry further in advance to solve

4774
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:29,680
those challenges along with the science

4775
03:08:27,439 --> 03:08:30,960
because those challenges can be just as

4776
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:32,720
important to the success of these

4777
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:34,479
therapies and I'd like to see those

4778
03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:36,720
solved much better in the future

4779
03:08:34,479 --> 03:08:38,840
absolutely I think it's not unreasonable

4780
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:41,120
within 10 years to imagine just a much

4781
03:08:38,840 --> 03:08:43,479
more systematic approach so whenever any

4782
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:45,359
baby is born they're sequenced and any

4783
03:08:43,479 --> 03:08:48,359
issue is immediately diagnosed at least

4784
03:08:45,359 --> 03:08:51,479
solving the the genetic um component of

4785
03:08:48,359 --> 03:08:53,600
this and then if I'm allowed a second a

4786
03:08:51,479 --> 03:08:55,160
second wish then as as you want then at

4787
03:08:53,600 --> 03:08:57,160
the very least can we get the loow

4788
03:08:55,160 --> 03:08:59,640
hanging fruit of matching up the

4789
03:08:57,160 --> 03:09:01,359
existing drugs with existing disorders

4790
03:08:59,640 --> 03:09:03,200
using some of the kinds of Technologies

4791
03:09:01,359 --> 03:09:05,080
we talked about today if we can just do

4792
03:09:03,200 --> 03:09:07,800
a first pass of all of those against

4793
03:09:05,080 --> 03:09:09,319
each other um we we really would get far

4794
03:09:07,800 --> 03:09:10,800
so what you're saying is let's maximize

4795
03:09:09,319 --> 03:09:12,720
the drugs that we have already invested

4796
03:09:10,800 --> 03:09:14,080
billions in building you know and make

4797
03:09:12,720 --> 03:09:15,920
sure that they're used for every last

4798
03:09:14,080 --> 03:09:17,479
patient who can benefit from those I

4799
03:09:15,920 --> 03:09:19,040
think that makes very good sense over

4800
03:09:17,479 --> 03:09:21,279
though hopefully in 10 years we can also

4801
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:25,120
be on our way to some new new treatments

4802
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:28,200
right to to um Aus Point anyone else

4803
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:29,439
vision for 10 years from now I'm yeah so

4804
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:31,680
this has been been addressed but you

4805
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:33,239
know there's concept of the systems

4806
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:35,520
level approach and I think it's a

4807
03:09:33,239 --> 03:09:36,920
systems level problem um it's not just a

4808
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:38,279
genetic problem it's also access to

4809
03:09:36,920 --> 03:09:40,760
healthcare access to a lot of other

4810
03:09:38,279 --> 03:09:43,640
factors you you know we work with some

4811
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:45,479
families in remote South Africa it is a

4812
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:47,560
whole another problem you're dealing

4813
03:09:45,479 --> 03:09:49,279
with that right and the patient here

4814
03:09:47,560 --> 03:09:52,120
could just go to Boston Children's same

4815
03:09:49,279 --> 03:09:54,040
day be seen by the world's top experts

4816
03:09:52,120 --> 03:09:56,000
um in this case that's just not possible

4817
03:09:54,040 --> 03:09:57,680
so what do you do and the answer is not

4818
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:59,680
nothing it's something but now what is

4819
03:09:57,680 --> 03:10:01,120
it right and so I think my my vision is

4820
03:09:59,680 --> 03:10:03,560
really that systems approach like We're

4821
03:10:01,120 --> 03:10:05,439
All in This Together uh rare isn't rare

4822
03:10:03,560 --> 03:10:07,359
it's just fragmented um I think

4823
03:10:05,439 --> 03:10:09,399
recognizing that is a is going to be a

4824
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:11,160
very key acknowledgement of the problem

4825
03:10:09,399 --> 03:10:14,720
and the sheer scale of the problem that

4826
03:10:11,160 --> 03:10:16,279
we're we're facing um and I I you know

4827
03:10:14,720 --> 03:10:18,680
it's a system system that we need to

4828
03:10:16,279 --> 03:10:21,960
build together um so I hopefully in 10

4829
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:24,479
years you have the same event and we

4830
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:26,000
have 500 successes and then well we

4831
03:10:24,479 --> 03:10:27,439
don't really need to do anything more

4832
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:29,200
that's my vision for we're all out of

4833
03:10:27,439 --> 03:10:30,279
work 10 years that would be great 10

4834
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:33,319
years we're all out of work that's

4835
03:10:30,279 --> 03:10:36,479
that's a great message any more

4836
03:10:33,319 --> 03:10:38,560
Visions mine is similar to yours I would

4837
03:10:36,479 --> 03:10:40,600
love to see newborn screening and whole

4838
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:42,239
genome sequencing on every baby not just

4839
03:10:40,600 --> 03:10:44,319
a baby in the nicku not just a baby with

4840
03:10:42,239 --> 03:10:46,479
symptoms to completely eliminate that

4841
03:10:44,319 --> 03:10:49,239
diagnostic Odyssey that causes so many

4842
03:10:46,479 --> 03:10:50,279
problems for everyone involved um so

4843
03:10:49,239 --> 03:10:52,560
that's what I would like to see and I

4844
03:10:50,279 --> 03:10:54,560
think that is closer than 10 years but

4845
03:10:52,560 --> 03:10:57,279
who knows with bureaucracy so that's my

4846
03:10:54,560 --> 03:10:59,920
wish that's great any more anything to

4847
03:10:57,279 --> 03:11:02,439
share Nathan or you're you're covered by

4848
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:04,680
that sounds great uh well so I'd like I

4849
03:11:02,439 --> 03:11:07,120
think to uh close this out you know with

4850
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:10,200
just uh again a huge thanks to all of

4851
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:12,880
you for coming to all of our speakers uh

4852
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:15,439
for uh excellent talks really in on a

4853
03:11:12,880 --> 03:11:17,439
broad array of uh topics uh I want to

4854
03:11:15,439 --> 03:11:19,640
thank again uh Katie liori who's been

4855
03:11:17,439 --> 03:11:21,560
sort of the logistical organiz organizer

4856
03:11:19,640 --> 03:11:23,880
behind all of this and my right-hand

4857
03:11:21,560 --> 03:11:26,040
person and Dr Jillian Shaw who was

4858
03:11:23,880 --> 03:11:27,720
curated an incredible program so thank

4859
03:11:26,040 --> 03:11:28,630

[Music]

4863
03:11:33,200 --> 03:11:38,520
big and just to say sort of as as a

4864
03:11:35,960 --> 03:11:40,800
closing uh kind of as a closing argument

4865
03:11:38,520 --> 03:11:42,600
if you will um I think we've done a lot

4866
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:44,279
of good work over the last 10 years and

4867
03:11:42,600 --> 03:11:45,760
of course much longer than that for all

4868
03:11:44,279 --> 03:11:48,279
of those who have been in this space for

4869
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:51,000
for a very long time there's clearly a

4870
03:11:48,279 --> 03:11:53,520
lot more work to be done um but I think

4871
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:55,680
that today you can see why I'm a glass

4872
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:58,279
half full Optimist I think that there's

4873
03:11:55,680 --> 03:12:01,040
a lot to be hopeful for we heard great

4874
03:11:58,279 --> 03:12:03,439
science uh promising Technologies also

4875
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:05,279
very interesting approaches and a huge

4876
03:12:03,439 --> 03:12:07,880
amount of commitment from all the

4877
03:12:05,279 --> 03:12:10,040

4878
03:12:07,880 --> 03:12:14,040

4882
03:12:19,560 --> 03:12:24,520
um of work ahead uh but there's a lot of

4883
03:12:22,359 --> 03:12:27,640

4884

progress uh coming uh our way if we

4885
03:12:27,640 --> 03:12:32,920
continue to uh think about this as a

4886
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:34,840
space that we own together as as shared
