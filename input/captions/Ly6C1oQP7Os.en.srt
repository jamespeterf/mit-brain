1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,320
so today I would like to uh

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:22,439
finish the first part by saying a few

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,320
more uh words about exergies and um the

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,279
allocation problems so that it's going

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,279
to be also useful for the

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,080
homework and and remember

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,239
that one of

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,600
the things that we have touched upon is

9
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,600
heating bul

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,120
flow for example heating water from

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,480
condition one to condition

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,199
two which therefore requires by the

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,160
energy balance H an energy which is

14
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:05,080
given by the fluoride

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,880
times the change in the enthalpy of the

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,159
flow that

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,840
maybe uh understood that or cold heat

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,680
even if it is a bit improper because

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,520
that is a it's not really a heat

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,720
interaction or at least it is a heat

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,520
interaction at multiple temperatures as

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,000
the temperature changes from one to two

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,000
here nevertheless if

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,360
we agree on on the meaning we can call

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,159
it heat and then the the coefficient of

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,159
performance

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:46,000
of for example in this case a heat

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,880
pump that provides that heat by

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,119
taking the necessary entropy from the

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,920
environment because in order to heat up

31
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,920
and also need to provide

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,560
entropy and uh if I take it from the

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,399
environment I avoid uh uh having a

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,399
generation by

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,239
irreversibility uh the machine needs

36
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,480
some work to

37
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,920
operate and the ratio between the Heat

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,040
and the work that are provided is called

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,040
the

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,680
cop so the cop plays the role of the

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,680
first low efficiency but it can be

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,239
higher than one so we call it cop we

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,239
don't call it

44
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,200
efficiency it's a ratio of two energies

45
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,159
whereas the second low efficiency is the

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,040
ratio you can cast it as

47
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:52,159
either the actual cop over the maximum

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,800
cop which you would obtain if the

49
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,480
Machinery was

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,840
reversible or you can cast it as the

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,599
ratio of the

52
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,000
exg change uh or the exergy that you

53
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,280
have provided to your bulk flow over the

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,159
exergy of the resource that you have

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,159
used in this case uh

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,720
work we have also seen that this combin

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
if

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,720
I take H2 minus H1 * m dot outside of

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,239
the parenthesis I and I recognize that

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,120
it we called it

61
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,920
QA the the remainder is a is a Carno

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,920
coefficient

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,920
looking

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:47,120
combination that if we Define uh H2

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,480
minus H1 over S2 minus S1 as the

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,519
logarithmic mean temperature or the

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,439
equivalent heat temperature that

68
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,799
provides the same ratio of energy and

69
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,879
entropy then it's you can write it you

70
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,560
can write it this way

71
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,920
and here you recognize that QA over W is

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,599
cop so the second low efficiency is

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,599
given by cop times the car

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,680
coefficient and what is the maximum

75
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,120
cop well the maximum

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:24,440
cop is when the second low efficiency is

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,320
equal to one 100% reversible

78
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,800
Machinery so you set this equal to one

79
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,520
and therefore cop Max is the inverse of

80
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
that caral

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,360
coefficient so we also played with some

82
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,880
numbers because this is an important

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,520
topic and it is a way in which we

84
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:53,280
consume a lot of uh energy so if we want

85
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:58,520
to improve our uh ways of using uh fuels

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,440
or any other uh exergy

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,280
resource uh

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,320
natural

89
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,199
resource for example nuclear and solar

90
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:15,360
and so on we want to

91
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:18,680
um know the uh efficiencies and so here

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,960
is a we gave an example of heating water

93
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:27,880
in an industrial uh uh setup typical

94
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,280
numbers could be from 60 to 120°

95
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,080
C and then if we compare compute that

96
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
carau

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,479
ratio and remember that here also we

98
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,520
need we need to make explicit uh the

99
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,639
Assumption of the environment that we

100
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,520
have available when we compute that

101
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,039
because that makes a lot of difference

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,560
especially for small

103
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,880
temperatures and um temperature

104
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,840
differences so here for example if I

105
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,360
take

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,000
300K here's the number the carau ratio

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,000
is 17.2%

108
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,560
and it's inverse which is the maximum

109
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
cop for the heat

110
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,919
pump therefore is

111
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:21,199
5.8 okay so 5.8 means that I spend one

112
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:26,160
unit of one kilowatt hour of

113
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:30,360
energy and I deliver 5.8 kilowatt hours

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,360
of energy to my stream

115
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,080
if I go to lower temperatures like in

116
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,520
Residential Heating from 20 to 60° at

117
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,840
the same environment

118
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:48,160
300K which which is like summertime

119
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:52,240
because it's 27 degrees C uh in that

120
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,440
case the Caro coefficient is

121
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,759
4% so you take the inverse of 4% it

122
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,800
gives

123
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,840
25 right so that means that in in

124
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,879
principle if you had a reversible heat

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:09,479
pump with 1 kilow of electrical energy

126
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,840
you provide 25 kilowatt hours of

127
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:16,120
heat whereas in

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,800
a electric boiler for one kilowatt hour

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,680
of energy you provide one kilowatt hour

130
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,039
of heat or maybe a little less because

131
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,160
maybe some is lost to the insulation of

132
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,160
the

133
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,080
boiler okay

134
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:40,919
then we also argued that

135
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:45,199
uh the current way in which we use fuels

136
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,759
namely burning them in a flame and then

137
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,440
using the hot products of combustion to

138
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,159
heat up a working fluid of some uh

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,840
thermal

140
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:02,280
cycle if we want to improve of that that

141
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:06,360
the efficiency of this and go beyond the

142
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:11,400
current says 64% which is obtained as

143
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:16,000
the product of an about 75% efficiency

144
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,800
of the combust of the flame and an 85

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,280
perc efficiency of the thermal

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,000
cycle you need to improve on these two

147
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,199
efficiencies but even if you improve the

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,039
thermal cycle to 100% you still stuck to

149
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:36,760
the limit of s 75 say 80% for the

150
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,240
flame and we've said we've seen that

151
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:44,159
history tells us that uh we are on our

152
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,720
learning process heading towards higher

153
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,519
efficiencies than uh

154
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:55,320
80% and so the only way we can reach

155
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,600
them is to find alternatives to the

156
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,600
combustion in

157
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,839
Flames the oxidation of of the fuel in

158
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,399
flames and we also said that when we do

159
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,760
chemical reactions and combustion in a

160
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,160
little more detail we will see this

161
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,640
diagram and we will see that the flame

162
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:20,760
goes this way and generates entropy by

163
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:26,440
reversibility whereas if you uh are uh

164
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:28,000
like in a fuel cell or more uh um um

165
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,959
able to

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
control uh the process and while the

167
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,760
system spontaneously wants to go from

168
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,440
fuel to products of combustion you

169
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,880
manage to to extract also some energy

170
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,040
like in the fuel cell then you may

171
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,760
reduce the entropy produced by

172
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,279
reversibility and your efficiencies can

173
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,200
be

174
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:56,560
higher like in some examples

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,800
here okay so

176
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,519
usually separate production of

177
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,079
electricity we produce

178
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:08,959
electricity in power uh in facility

179
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:12,279
power plants that use our

180
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:16,440
fuel and remember we said that the for

181
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:19,440
the moment but also for typical

182
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,200
applications it is fair to um

183
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:28,079
approximate the exergy of the

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:31,360
fuel by its uh heating volume so energy

185
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,959
and exergy content are very similar of

186
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,959
the order of plus or minus 2% depending

187
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:42,160
on the hydrocarbons so this is a is a

188
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:45,279
fair approximation in practice so you

189
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,800
use this fuel you burn it you obtain

190
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,760
these products of combustion and then

191
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,160
you transfer the heat from the product

192
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,320
of combustion to uh

193
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,920
um working fluid of the thermal cycle

194
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,000
then of course the product combustion

195
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,440
must be

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
exhausted to the

197
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,560
atmosphere and as we all know we are all

198
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,160
concerned about uh pollution that comes

199
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,959
from these

200
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,959
exhausts U not

201
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,880
only the

202
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:29,519
global

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:33,440
uh pollutant uh CO2 carbon dioxide

204
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:38,040
um which is pollutant only in terms of

205
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:43,680
playing a role in greenhouse effect as

206
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:45,560
we all know uh but also other products

207
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,160
of combustion like

208
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,079
uh

209
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,000
nox so the

210
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,000
various oxides of

211
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,480
nitrogen which can produce acid rain and

212
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,480
other various effects

213
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:09,440
so you need to control what gets out

214
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,440
there and typically what gets out

215
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,040
there H is uh at

216
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:22,440
relatively high

217
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:26,120
temperature say maybe 110 140 de

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,560
Celsius um this is when you don't

219
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,720
want the water that is in the produ of

220
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,519
combustion to

221
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:39,519
condense that is to avoid because some

222
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:43,160
fuels have some sulfur content and uh

223
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,440
water with sulfur makes um sulfuric acid

224
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,560
and

225
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:51,320
that's uh corrosive and you want to um

226
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,320
avoid that

227
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
but um you can

228
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:03,079
also have condensation so you if you you

229
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,720
can uh use higher level

230
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:09,199
materials uh that can sustain uh

231
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,240
corrosion you can also uh condense part

232
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,519
of the water that is produced by the

233
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:20,079
combustion process in that

234
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:22,279
case you extract a little more uh

235
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,959
energy and then we talk instead of a

236
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,800
lower heating value it's actually you're

237
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:32,120
exploiting getting closer to the higher

238
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,639
heating value or somewhere in in between

239
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,639
we'll see some details about this but

240
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,160
here the idea is that this energy is

241
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,880
transferred to this to this thing and to

242
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:47,519
this working fluid and then the thermal

243
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:51,120
the thermal cycle provides uh

244
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,360
work and of course since you're are

245
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,360
extracting not only energy but also

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,480
entropy the thermal cycle must

247
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:04,040
discharge uh that entropy to the

248
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:10,160
environment which is uh at the moment

249
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,160
still considered a a sort of a a

250
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,480
free way of getting rid of of of

251
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,440
entropy although some some places we

252
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,519
talking about of course you need

253
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,279
authorization to do that so that is

254
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:32,560
equivalent to uh not being exactly uh um

255
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:34,680
for free not anymore in other words we

256
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,000
we cannot use the environment as a as a

257
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:42,959
as a thermal dump

258
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,959
uh for for free

259
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,519
anymore okay first low efficiency here

260
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:55,000
we have only one product which whose

261
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:59,720
energy content is w and only only one

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,240
uh uh energy source

263
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,399
which is the fuel which energy content

264
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,079
is

265
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,519
Q so that's the first low

266
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,320
efficiency and typical for first low

267
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,480
efficiencies as we said uh could be yes

268
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,000
the best available technology could be

269
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:23,000
maybe

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,480
65% uh but the average um the average

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,680
efficiency of like a

272
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,519
national um lot of of U of power plants

273
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,319
uh well it varies from country to

274
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:41,120
country of course for example I think

275
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,120
that in Italy is between 42 and

276
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,600
45% the second low efficiency is the

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,800
ratio of the exergy of the product to

278
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,000
the exergy of

279
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,360
your uh

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,040
fuel now considering that the exit can

281
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,639
be approximated to the energy of the

282
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:09,040
fuel you see that for this particular

283
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,240
case the second low efficiency is equal

284
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,759
to the first low

285
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:19,759
efficiency so indeed if you are at 65%

286
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,759
the 65% the margin for improvement is 35

287
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,720
you still have you only have 35 to go to

288
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:30,720
get

289
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:34,079
100% And remember that second low wise

290
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,199
100% is not impossible it's the upper

291
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,720
limit it's what you would have for a

292
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,720
reversible

293
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:48,199
Machinery okay so the message is here

294
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,160
that for this particular case AA 2 is

295
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,160
equal to AA 1

296
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,600
approximately now when we instead of

297
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,800
producing electricity we want to heat up

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,679
some something for example here simple

299
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,000
case of eating up

300
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:10,720
a room at some um fixed temperature or

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,959
maybe heating

302
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,799
up uh water to make it boil at some

303
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:21,280
temperature for

304
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:25,199
example here 120° some pressurized uh

305
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,720
steam production which is very common in

306
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,840
industrial processes for for M material

307
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,840
processing and so on

308
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:39,039
okay so now the first low efficiency is

309
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,960
the ratio of the heat that you

310
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,160
produce that you deliver so this is your

311
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,360
final

312
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,600
product H over the uh energy of the

313
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,080
fuel the second LW efficiency instead is

314
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,919
the ratio of the exergy of that heat so

315
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,039
it's the heat multiplied by the caror

316
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,679
coefficient

317
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,360
divided by the

318
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,240
xgy then again we use the approximation

319
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,559
that the XG is equal to the uh energy

320
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,280
content of the fuel and therefore we

321
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,679
recognize this ratio here is AA one so

322
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,440
in this case the second low efficiency

323
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,960
is equal to the first low efficiency

324
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,960
times the Cal

325
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,320
coefficient so for example if you want

326
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,240
to produce steam

327
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:36,720
120° in unit environment at

328
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,720
283 uh you compute and you have

329
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,200
a a

330
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,000
boiler that consumes for example natural

331
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,480
gas and it is

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,880
95% first flow efficient so ETA one is

333
00:18:50,480 --> 00:19:01,280
95% it means that only 5% is lost to the

334
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,280
flu gases uh through the stack and that

335
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:10,679
means so you got 95% times the Caro

336
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,679
coefficient here makes about

337
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,799
27% so that in that

338
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,520
case the margin for improvement is much

339
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,360
higher like

340
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,360
73% to go to

341
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:33,880
100 in some sense we should say that if

342
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,559
this is a representative of

343
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:42,440
our uh typical way of heating up water

344
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:46,120
in industrial processing by using

345
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,080
fuels uh the fact that uh for this

346
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,799
technology we are only 27% whereas for

347
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,480
power production we are 65% means that

348
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,280
we are at different levels of maturity

349
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,200
of this uh uses of

350
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,440
uh natural resources for these two

351
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,679
different

352
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,679
Technologies and

353
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,080
products most of the times

354
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,840
we many times the the burner doesn't

355
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,240
have to heat up something at constant

356
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,159
temperature like when you boil something

357
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,960
but uh needs to heat up uh for example

358
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:32,320
water again for residential purposes

359
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,320
typical number numbers are from 20 to

360
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,280
60 and so here are these uh again we

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,080
have uh that since the temperature is

362
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,840
changing here we can define a

363
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,159
logarithmic mean

364
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,440
temperature which is the temperature

365
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,799
that enters in the Carno

366
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,360
coefficient and again the second low

367
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,200
efficiency is equal to the first low

368
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,600
efficiency times the caral coefficient

369
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,600
and uh

370
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,039
the typical number varies depending on

371
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,600
what temperature T not you uh choose so

372
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,039
depending on whether you

373
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:15,120
are winter or

374
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:20,240
summer so for example if you are in the

375
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,120
summer 255° C is 29

376
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,880
298k uh

377
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:29,919
residential a residential domestic um

378
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,799
boiler which has an efficieny Co about

379
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:38,120
85% first

380
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,120
LW gets a second low efficiency of just

381
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:46,919
4% winter

382
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:50,919
time if outside is at 0 degrees Celsius

383
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,360
freezing then it's

384
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,480
11% for an industrial boiler the

385
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,400
efficiency is a little better first low

386
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,400
efficiency let's say 95%

387
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,600
and if you go

388
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,960
from uh yeah okay maybe this is not to

389
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,200
this this should be a 60 probably these

390
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,159
numbers I think I did that for from 60

391
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,440
220 well check the numbers if you

392
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:27,080
interested and uh it it gives 12 12

393
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,799
12% in the summer and 19% for second low

394
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,679
efficiency during the winter

395
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,919
so there

396
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,919
are ample margins of

397
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:42,080
improvement and one of them is

398
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,960
cenation as we

399
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,919
said produce with that fuel electricity

400
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,880
and then

401
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:56,520
use your low temperature uh uh

402
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:01,720
need uh low temperature heat that is

403
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,720
needed uh to as a as a for

404
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,039
entropy and therefore this becomes a

405
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:13,120
second product or say a

406
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:16,159
byproduct the second low efficiency then

407
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,840
has at the numerator the exergies of the

408
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,279
two

409
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,480
products work for the exergy of the work

410
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,960
of the electricity and heat times its

411
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,960
Carno coefficient for the exergy of the

412
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,960
heat divided by the the

413
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,919
fuel and

414
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:45,520
again uh this is the same thing

415
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:48,760
uh where we highlight that the

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,760
temperature uh if the temperature of

417
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,960
what you're heating is changing you need

418
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,960
to put in the the logarithmic mean

419
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
temperature

420
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,039
you can also

421
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:12,880
do um the same kind of calculations for

422
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,240
refrigeration because often in in

423
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,640
industrial processes but also in air

424
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,880
conditioning residential air

425
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,600
conditioning you need

426
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,039
to cool down for example air

427
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,679
conditioning you need to cool down a

428
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:32,279
working fluid between 12 and 7 from 12

429
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,279
to 7° C

430
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,279
typical so you have you can define a

431
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,279
coop of the

432
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,559
refrigeration which is the heating load

433
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,919
so the heat that it takes away from the

434
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,919
working

435
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,480
fluid divided by the work that you have

436
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,799
spent in order to run the Machinery

437
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,320
typically

438
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,080
compression

439
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,880
uh cycle a refrigeration cycle but not

440
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,520
not

441
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:09,520
necessarily uh and then you um so this

442
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:13,399
is the cop the second low

443
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:17,720
efficiency is uh well you can view this

444
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:19,799
as minus QC times the Caro

445
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,320
coefficient and again the second low

446
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,799
efficiency therefore is the cop times

447
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,480
the caral

448
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,440
coefficient and for typical values

449
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,360
I mean for an industrial refrigerator

450
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,840
for which the cop is about five which is

451
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,240
relatively

452
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,159
High it means that you spend one

453
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:46,760
kilowatt hour and

454
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:49,200
extract 5 kilowatt hours of heat from

455
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:53,000
from from the

456
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,520
cooling as a cooling effect so

457
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,679
five you multiply by the coral

458
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:03,120
coefficient for those temperatures at a

459
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,559
an outside temperature of uh what is it

460
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:10,200
30°

461
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,200
C and you get a second low efficiency of

462
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:15,679
36% not

463
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,960
bad at least compared with heating it it

464
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:28,039
seems that with cooling we're doing

465
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,919
better in fact machinery for cooling is

466
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:33,520
a you know the same as the Machinery

467
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:37,640
that we use for heat pumps it requires

468
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,679
more uh investment more materials and

469
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,960
it's more sophisticated than just a

470
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,240
plain burning something and uh using a

471
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,240
heat

472
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,720
exchanger

473
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,320
now people have tried

474
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,000
also the simultaneous combined

475
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,320
production of power

476
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,360
heat and cooling it's called three

477
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,440
generation you have three

478
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,039
products and

479
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,000
um it's actually you can actually this

480
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:18,880
is this considers also the the fact that

481
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,880
you may have you that you may use as

482
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,840
a possible resource oh no no sorry this

483
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,840
is the this is the cooling effect okay

484
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,039
this is the cooling effect uh

485
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,200
and so this uses as as a resource only

486
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
the

487
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:45,600
fuel and therefore you have three um you

488
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:49,240
have three um

489
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,080
products and here is one of the of the

490
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,760
problems it's not so easy to

491
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,360
Define

492
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,000
uh first low

493
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,559
efficiency because you have

494
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,240
you have to put the

495
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,039
enumerator apple and or C you have to

496
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,159
put um heat

497
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:15,159
work and cooling so so they don't uh

498
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:19,200
they're different U uh animals and uh

499
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,200
they shouldn't stay together in a

500
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,960
numerator but you could Define separate

501
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,279
efficiencies provided we have have a way

502
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,840
to allocate the fuel

503
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:39,640
consumption and assign a fraction of

504
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,640
it for each of the

505
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:48,600
products which is the idea

506
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:53,840
of this uh allocation that we now

507
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,840
getting uh to refresh

508
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,279
again so

509
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,320
the you see

510
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:08,399
every local area that could be a nation

511
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,200
for example here I put some numbers and

512
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,279
the flag for Italy and if you're

513
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,159
interested in if you have a preferred

514
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:18,200
country you can do this table it would

515
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,200
be interesting in any case to

516
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
search

517
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,080
uh and to see for example for separate

518
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,080
production

519
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:36,880
one thing is to to consider what it is

520
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,880
the average uh National

521
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,000
efficiency uh and one is the efficiency

522
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,000
of the best available

523
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,440
technology and then you have the same

524
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,360
for Combined heat and

525
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:59,320
power and you can do also the same for

526
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,840
when you hybridize

527
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:07,360
your uh use of resources by using some

528
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:11,080
that are fossil fuels and some that are

529
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,559
um renewable

530
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,919
resources and of course each line is for

531
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,440
what product you are interested in so

532
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,159
electric

533
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:25,000
power uh residential

534
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:28,679
heat uh winter

535
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,279
summer industrial heat Cooling

536
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,159
and so

537
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,159
on yeah the list is is long because

538
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,399
energy product in you could also

539
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,440
consider the prod the the production of

540
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:45,960
materials for example aluminum is a very

541
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:51,640
from from the or is boyon whatever it is

542
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:54,799
you uh is is a very energy consuming uh

543
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:58,519
process and so talking about

544
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,200
efficiencies is important and also doing

545
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:05,559
a

546
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:09,679
cogeneration uh is also a way to save

547
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:12,360
energy so use better our natural

548
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,399
resources and for each one of these uh

549
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:21,080
Technologies or or or products Energy

550
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,080
Products we can also

551
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,200
study where we are in the learning curve

552
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,120
and as you as you be seen this is the

553
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,880
learning curve for power

554
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:41,480
production if we did the learning curve

555
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:45,000
for a heat we would be uh just about uh

556
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,000
here between 10 and

557
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,600
20% uh cooling is between 20 and 30 so

558
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,880
so the curves will be

559
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,880
shifted and

560
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,799
probably uh also

561
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,880
the characteristic time could be

562
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:08,720
different but in any case you see it's

563
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,000
not in the m in a matter of uh just a

564
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:17,080
few

565
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,080
years it requires many years to mature a

566
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,279
technology so that also as car message

567
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,360
that if you are in the

568
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:34,840
energy uh business or if you

569
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,240
want uh to listen to a politician you

570
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,960
have to be

571
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,840
careful because nobody can promise

572
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,840
results in short

573
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:55,880
times okay so that's another interesting

574
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:58,840
story so that brings us to the uh

575
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,960
problem of allocation as uh

576
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,799
so we have already

577
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:10,039
discussed in a CO generation

578
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:12,240
facility it amounts to defining these uh

579
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:14,720
coefficients Alpha that are the

580
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,840
fractions of the fuel that we think are

581
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,639
used for the two products that we assign

582
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,360
to the two products and we've seen that

583
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:25,360
uh this assignment is a

584
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,440
bit arbitrary there is no law of physics

585
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:32,559
that tells us how to do it

586
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,559
and each one has its pros and cons and

587
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,559
uh

588
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,679
um uh in particular in order to evaluate

589
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:47,159
these you it is interesting to see this

590
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:53,039
primary Energy savings because

591
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:56,240
cogeneration does uh allow you to reduce

592
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,519
the the overall fuel consumption then uh

593
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,279
if you did it in separ production

594
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:04,760
facilities so there is savings and the

595
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:07,720
problem of these Alphas is how you

596
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:14,399
allocate that those

597
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:14,399
Savings of to the two products heat and

598
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,879
work and once you have chosen those

599
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Alphas you can Define the

600
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:28,200
cops uh and the partial efficiency of

601
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,599
your work and of your heat production

602
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,200
and as we said uh

603
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:36,599
this uh topic all

604
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:40,560
started when the cop of heat production

605
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:43,359
became important in determining the

606
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,320
Energy Efficiency of

607
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,919
buildings which in turn determines the

608
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:54,480
value of these

609
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:54,480
buildings so this has an economic uh

610
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,920
impact and uh this incremental

611
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,079
electricity centered allocation method

612
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,680
which was

613
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,520
uh uh assigning all the energy savings

614
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,480
to the production of

615
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,640
heat is what triggered

616
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,320
the

617
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,440
uh

618
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,520
the the need to do something better

619
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,240
because

620
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,119
that is

621
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,119
unfair with respect to uh other people

622
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:31,640
who would produce heat uh by just

623
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,640
burning the

624
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,599
fuel so typically one would uh uh Define

625
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,079
this

626
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:48,079
reference efficiencies for um the

627
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,079
separate production

628
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,960
facilities defined by some

629
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Authority and then uh Define this

630
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,200
coefficient of allocation as the

631
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,480
weighted sum of what I would consume to

632
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,079
produce that same amount of electricity

633
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,319
and

634
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:10,319
in in a in separate production

635
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:18,000
facilities at least this method has the

636
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:20,119
advantage to uh

637
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,920
split

638
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,359
evenly the primary Energy savings

639
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,560
between the two

640
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,560
products so if I say 20

641
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,920
% I

642
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,200
assigned a 20% Improvement to the

643
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,760
efficiency of work and a 20% Improvement

644
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,760
to the efficiency of

645
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,839
heat

646
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,720
um the people that are really fond of

647
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,960
thermodynamics and would like to solve

648
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,560
every problem with

649
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,319
thermodynamics uh insisted for a while

650
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,880
that you should use the exergy

651
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:11,119
method which takes as

652
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,599
reference the reversible process because

653
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,280
after all that

654
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:20,400
is the ultimate Target that we should uh

655
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:25,200
be um heading

656
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:28,920
towards uh however the problem is that

657
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,400
as we've seen in the learning curve

658
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,520
heat and

659
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,119
work uh technologies have not the same

660
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,440
level of maturity and therefore we are

661
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:42,760
the the the the the distance of where we

662
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,040
are from where we could be with a

663
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:52,119
reversible Machinery which is the exergy

664
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:56,760
target uh is very different like maybe

665
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:59,720
35% uh for electricity and uh maybe 80%

666
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:04,680
or even more for

667
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:10,440
heat and this makes uh

668
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:13,800
uh this makes giv again gives too much

669
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,760
advantage to the heat because the the

670
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,040
weight with which uh the Energy savings

671
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,599
would be split between work and heat

672
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,880
would would be proportional to that uh

673
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,079
uh margin of

674
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,440
improvement and in

675
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,079
fact if we look at the numbers for this

676
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,640
example

677
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,800
here we find that uh we we you would

678
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,960
have a

679
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,960
cop of

680
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,839
200 which is better than the

681
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:56,000
350 of the electricity centered

682
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:59,000
method but in a more realistic uh uh

683
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,960
with more realistic uh

684
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,960
reference

685
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,960
efficiencies you would

686
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,359
have much more

687
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,440
reasonable numbers I mean lower numbers

688
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:20,720
like 92 maybe

689
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:23,119
96% for the cop of residential in this

690
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,319
District heating which which is good

691
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,319
because it's better than say the typical

692
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:28,319
85%

693
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:39,440
uh and also uh it gives a a a more more

694
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,119
fair

695
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,839
split uh between work and

696
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:50,319
heat now

697
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:53,200
uh the homework doesn't call you to um

698
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:56,640
to do anything about this method of

699
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,000
local area because that is not yet been

700
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,680
uh accepted or Incorporated in any of

701
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,680
the standards it's just an

702
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,100
idea and

703
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,920
um nevertheless it's interesting

704
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,400
[Music]

705
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:19,720
to to say that essentially what the

706
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,960
local Authority should uh uh use

707
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:25,079
according to our suggestion

708
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,640
is um as reference

709
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,680
efficiencies the average efficiencies of

710
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,400
the local area including the the

711
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,400
combined heat and power uh production

712
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,760
facilities that

713
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:45,440
way if your combined

714
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,960
uh U

715
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,000
facility is like in this

716
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:56,400
case uh more more

717
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,400
efficient than the reference

718
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,839
then it

719
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,800
deserves some incentive or at least clap

720
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,680
uh uh

721
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,200
because they're doing better than the

722
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,839
average in the local area so one

723
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,800
Criterion also

724
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:22,960
for either giving incentives or giving

725
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:28,079
authorization to to make a new uh Power

726
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,680
Plant is so that it meets uh higher

727
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,960
efficiency so it highers it has a higher

728
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,920
efficiency than the average and

729
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:39,640
therefore in turn it will higher the uh

730
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:44,560
average uh efficiency of the area so

731
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,560
that would be beneficial for

732
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,000
everybody the converse is when we do a

733
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,920
hybrid power

734
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,440
plants and in this

735
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,920
case we are we are using uh in this

736
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:10,880
paper just not a Coen generation but

737
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,880
just power production only Power

738
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,760
production and instead of using just

739
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,520
fuel you use fuel and integrate that

740
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,240
fuel with some renewable like solar

741
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,200
energy or vice versa instead of having

742
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:29,160
just a renewable just solar energy

743
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,599
heating um Power plant like those power

744
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,359
plants with mirrors that we have

745
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,720
uh said the other the other the other

746
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:40,720
day and you can look it up there are a

747
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:46,480
few prototypes in California in Spain in

748
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,480
Italy and probably other places too

749
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:53,200
um

750
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,800
nevertheless the fact that um of course

751
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,920
solar energy is not always available and

752
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,000
there for uh you need to either make

753
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,800
some storage in order to have it

754
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,319
function continuously or you could

755
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:12,920
integrate with fuel for when um to to

756
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:15,559
compensate when uh there are clouds or

757
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:20,520
or or nighttime so there is no solar

758
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:23,880
energy uh available in this way you may

759
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:28,119
have advantages both from the point of

760
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:32,079
view of efficiency

761
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:36,680
so it's more stable uh

762
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:39,240
uh input for your power plant and also

763
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:43,680
for the cost because the investment is

764
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:46,680
going to be uh diluted over more hours

765
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,680
of

766
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:54,920
operation so it is important in these uh

767
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,920
case also to determine

768
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,440
these fractions

769
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,520
the

770
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,599
betas the fractions of

771
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,280
um of the

772
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,280
product that can be understood as

773
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:16,400
being the product of the fossil or the

774
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,480
product of the renewable

775
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,480
part so if I could identify what

776
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,119
fraction of the electricity produced is

777
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,880
considered renewable this would be at

778
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,680
the same level as say

779
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,079
photovoltaic

780
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,800
uh energy because it's photovoltaic

781
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,599
energy is

782
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:44,839
a is a like a separate

783
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,839
production from solar to uh

784
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:54,040
electricity and so there is no reason

785
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:58,000
why if the country decides to um give an

786
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,599
incentive to photovoltaics

787
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,160
why there's no reason why they shouldn't

788
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,920
give also an incentive to a hybrid

789
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:10,839
facility at

790
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:15,640
least in uh in as far as the uh fraction

791
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:15,640
of electricity that is recognized as

792
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,200
renewable

793
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,920
because in the

794
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,200
end it turns out that these facilities

795
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,079
hybrid facilities

796
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,839
have higher uh slightly higher uh

797
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,800
efficiencies than photovoltaics so if

798
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:39,839
photovolatic is like 15%

799
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,000
efficient uh these facilities may may go

800
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,440
over

801
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,160
15% and so it is it may be a better way

802
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,480
of

803
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:54,280
using solar energy for electricity

804
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,280
production so also

805
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,880
here uh at

806
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,920
the

807
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,880
uh beginning people thought of uh

808
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,640
assigning all the benefit of the

809
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,640
hybridization to the uh renewable

810
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:18,520
aspect but then this would be

811
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,520
unfair

812
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:26,640
because this power facilities would

813
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:32,720
hybrid facilities would uh would get the

814
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,720
in incentives even if they don't deserve

815
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,760
it because part of the savings that is

816
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:45,040
made by the hybridization it should also

817
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:47,680
go to the U fossil line of the power

818
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,400
plant so also

819
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,760
here a reasonable way is to use a

820
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:58,839
reference

821
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,839
production so it it would be uh the

822
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,440
the waited the

823
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,200
um the

824
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:11,280
fraction of what

825
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,880
the of how

826
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,160
much uh electricity you would

827
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,160
produce with that fuel in a separate

828
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,920
production

829
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,160
facility and the other is uh how much

830
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,720
electricity you would use would produce

831
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:33,119
in a solar

832
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,040
facility and these weighted ratios are

833
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:40,599
balanced but of course somebody has to

834
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,599
Define what reference efficiencies to

835
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,200
use and

836
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:54,200
again there is this consideration of uh

837
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:57,760
the xergy method that

838
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,720
uh would um provide

839
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,920
like

840
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:06,760
100% as

841
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:11,240
the target the reversible uh

842
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:13,720
Target and 93% for the reversible Target

843
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,079
in uh the conversion of solar energy

844
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,079
into uh

845
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:23,559
electricity uh

846
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:27,359
but these targets are very far from the

847
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:31,280
actual level of uh

848
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:36,640
average efficiencies and therefore it is

849
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:39,800
dangerous to use those as uh references

850
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:44,240
it is better to use as

851
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:48,680
references something fixed or again

852
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,160
something based on a local area so the

853
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,920
average

854
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,839
values of the

855
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,200
uh partial efficiencies in the in the

856
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:01,440
local

857
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:04,799
area so that again also

858
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,040
here you could argue that uh who

859
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:09,720
deserves the incentives the economic

860
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:14,240
incentives are only those who improve

861
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:20,359
somewhat to the average uh usage of

862
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,359
those resources in in the local area

863
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,520
so for the

864
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:34,520
numbers here there is an

865
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:42,720
example yeah I think I skipped one uh

866
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,319
one I I removed one slide in which would

867
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,119
saying oh yeah here it is the the the

868
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:50,240
separate

869
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:54,359
production uh for

870
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:58,640
solar that is typically say average of

871
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:58,640
of today for photovolatic is

872
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:06,359
15.3% and the and here we use the 38% M

873
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,400
maybe we could have put also 42 maybe

874
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:11,200
also 45%

875
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,920
today for the separate production of

876
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:19,079
electricity from fuels okay now here's

877
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,079
this the the hybrid

878
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:27,920
facility and these numbers

879
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:31,280
Define the relative role of of hybrid

880
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,920
production in the local area for example

881
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,799
this says that over of the overall

882
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,440
electricity

883
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:45,640
45% is a hybrid and

884
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,640
10% is separate solar so like

885
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,599
photovoltaics and

886
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:59,640
then by

887
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,640
using this um self

888
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,040
tuned

889
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:10,280
average

890
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:10,280
local uh separate local production

891
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:17,839
references here's the is the numbers

892
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,079
it's for example it would say that this

893
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,799
hybrid

894
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:29,160
facility improves the efficiency of

895
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:29,160
production from solar from 15% to

896
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:36,119
18.7% the exergy method would have said

897
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:39,599
that the Improvement is to

898
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:42,599
35% giving therefore a lot of credit and

899
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,200
therefore very high incentives and the

900
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,480
the the fuel center the even

901
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,480
higher so

902
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:58,040
nonsense so if you happen to end up

903
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,359
working in one of these

904
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:04,200
agencies that

905
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:07,200
Define regulations and that keep

906
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:12,119
following um

907
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:18,079
the the evolution of local areas and the

908
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:21,079
improvements uh you have to be aware of

909
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,079
avoiding

910
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:32,000
uh wrong numbers that would uh uh

911
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,960
change the direction of uh Technologies

912
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,520
or

913
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:40,200
investments in

914
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:43,000
in not where you want it to be

915
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,920
going so because these numbers and in

916
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,720
particular the lows

917
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,640
that determine incentives based on these

918
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:57,160
numbers determine the choices of the

919
00:52:51,640 --> 00:53:00,839
companies in where to invest in what

920
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,480
okay all right so with with this I think

921
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:06,480
I have

922
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,040
um said a little more about uh this

923
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,960
problem of allocation and uh if you

924
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,680
still have some questions maybe this is

925
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,119
the time for for the homework for

926
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:22,200
example maybe this is the time to

927
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:27,000
ask uh if it is all clear then okay in

928
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:29,400
any case if you need help I'm available

929
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,960
in the office just email me and we we

930
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,720
can set up an appointment or just uh

931
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,720
chat by

932
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,240
email

933
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:45,520
okay yeah because

934
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,680
now I want to move to the second part of

935
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,680
the

936
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,839
course this was an initial slide you

937
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,440
remember where we said uh in the second

938
00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:00,079
part of the course we're going to de

939
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:03,920
deal with chemical potentials and multi

940
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,920
constituent uh

941
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:12,079
systems so in part we have

942
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:16,480
already

943
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:19,799
discussed uh because these are stable a

944
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,839
lot of of of these is is played with a

945
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,559
stable equilibrium States and we said a

946
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,359
lot about the properties of stable

947
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:27,960
equilibrium States and in

948
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:31,799
fact in the next

949
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,079
uh uh few slides I'll just uh which are

950
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:35,920
full of

951
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:39,799
formulas as usual

952
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,880
um I'll just

953
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:46,160
um review quickly what the things that

954
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:49,640
we've already said that are uh relevant

955
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:53,160
to the applications that uh then we want

956
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:57,359
to need to we want to focus

957
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,359
on uh next

958
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:14,280
so this part is uh divided into three

959
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:18,160
other

960
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:20,920
parts the first one is defining

961
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,920
properties of

962
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:28,160
mixtures

963
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,160
in single phase

964
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,599
so we'll have to talk about partial

965
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:38,000
properties Define what what they are

966
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,319
Define some ideal mixture and here I

967
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,520
should also add another uh topic which

968
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:47,119
is ideal solution U

969
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:50,760
Behavior we will talk about osmotic

970
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:56,680
pressure we will talk about the minimum

971
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,680
work uh from for SE separation

972
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,799
of a mixture into its

973
00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:05,799
components or the maximum work that you

974
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:05,799
can extract from

975
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,440
mixing if you don't do it irreversibly

976
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,559
and then um yeah osmotic pressure and

977
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,720
the so-called blue energy and then also

978
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,000
the problem of

979
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,599
stratification uh so what's the

980
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,880
composition in the air at various

981
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,079
Heights then there will be a second part

982
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:32,079
that will will deal

983
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:34,480
with liquid Vapor equilibrium or say two

984
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,119
phase States for

985
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:42,559
mixtures and the third part which deals

986
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,559
with systems or mixtures with chemical

987
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:52,559
reactions most of it is covered is is

988
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,920
still covered sorry is covered by the

989
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,920
book here

990
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:10,079
so here is

991
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:13,880
a dense summary of things that we have

992
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:17,640
seen you remember we defined uh these

993
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:21,000
characteristic uh functions starting

994
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,559
from the fundamental relation of the

995
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,559
stable equilibrium

996
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,920
States and Performing the lendra

997
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:31,000
transform of some of its variables or

998
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,720
all of its variables we defined

999
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,960
alternative ways of describing the

1000
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,960
properties of stable

1001
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:50,359
equilibrium and among these we uh thisan

1002
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:53,079
transforms we defined the F which is the

1003
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:56,200
elol free energy G which is the Gibs

1004
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:58,839
free energy H which is the enthalpy and

1005
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:02,079
and the EU which is the oiler free

1006
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:06,960
energy they're all

1007
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,960
related like this of

1008
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,400
course

1009
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:15,400
uh where you

1010
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,400
see

1011
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,680
this that means

1012
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:32,520
the summation of the products of the

1013
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,400
various constituents so we

1014
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,640
already set

1015
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,640
up for dealing with

1016
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,920
mixtures it is also this uh Oiler uh

1017
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,240
free

1018
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,280
energy is a function of temperature

1019
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,599
pressure and chemical potential so that

1020
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:02,480
means that you can measure it

1021
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,480
by uh uh

1022
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:09,839
appropriate Mutual equilibrium of your

1023
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,520
mixture with an appropriate environment

1024
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:14,520
of which you know the temperature the

1025
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,520
pressure and the chemical

1026
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:24,520
potentials because essentially the value

1027
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:28,039
of the oil g g oil free free energy of

1028
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,039
your uh mixture

1029
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,839
depends only on

1030
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:37,200
that

1031
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:39,839
so once you fixed your Reservoir in a

1032
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,880
completely open situation in which the

1033
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:45,960
system can exchange uh energy therefore

1034
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,640
temperature equality with the reservoir

1035
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,720
pressure I'm sorry volume therefore

1036
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,640
pressure in equality with the reservoir

1037
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,720
and it can exchange also all

1038
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:59,160
constituents with your Reservoir so the

1039
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:02,799
all the chemical potentials of your

1040
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,200
system for each substance must be equal

1041
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:09,000
to the chemical

1042
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:12,000
potential of the reservoir of the

1043
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
corresponding

1044
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:20,039
substance and so that provides ways to

1045
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,400
uh do these measurements of these Oiler

1046
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:27,960
function of course the oiler function is

1047
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,960
important as we emphasized the force

1048
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:35,119
systems it's also important for large

1049
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:40,119
systems because for large systems it is

1050
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:44,319
identically equal to zero as we as part

1051
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:50,039
of the result of the uh simple system

1052
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:55,480
model in which we have seen that the

1053
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:59,960
um refraction effects at walls are uh

1054
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:05,920
not in important and therefore for

1055
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:08,920
example the work associated with to in

1056
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,160
placing a partition into in your

1057
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:14,520
system or the entropy uh prod produced

1058
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:18,640
by reversibility if you remove a

1059
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:22,920
partition become negligible for large

1060
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:27,160
amounts and uh and so in that

1061
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:29,400
case since the uh Oiler uh free energy

1062
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:32,760
is related as we have seen to that work

1063
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:36,240
and to that irreversibility

1064
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:39,599
of uh placing or removing uh

1065
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:43,799
partitions uh that that in the limit of

1066
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:46,480
large number of particles that goes to

1067
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:48,200
zero and G and that gives rise to the

1068
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,799
so-called I mean the what is known as

1069
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,799
the oiler

1070
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,359
relation and also

1071
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,400
if you subtract the differential of the

1072
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:03,480
oiler relation from the Gibs relation

1073
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,000
which is the differential of the

1074
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,440
fundamental relation you get this other

1075
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,599
relation

1076
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:15,480
between differentials that is called the

1077
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,480
Gibbs doem

1078
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:24,599
relation which we already used when we

1079
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:24,599
did the for example the Gibs phase rule

1080
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:39,240
now the various forms the

1081
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:41,559
various differentials of this of the

1082
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,400
fundamental relation or

1083
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:45,680
the or

1084
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:51,599
the or

1085
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:53,520
the transforms of it elal GS enthalpy so

1086
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,880
these expressions for the

1087
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:59,520
differentials are useful in in order to

1088
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,880
identify just by

1089
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:06,359
inspection uh what are the natural

1090
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:10,119
variables of these uh of these functions

1091
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:12,160
so for energy the natural for the energy

1092
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:15,279
form of the fundamental relation the

1093
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:19,520
natural variables as we know are s

1094
01:03:15,279 --> 01:03:19,520
entropy volume and the amounts of

1095
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,079
constituents and the amounts of

1096
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,680
constituents can be written in terms of

1097
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,960
mole fraction

1098
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,960
this

1099
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,079
way and

1100
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:38,200
also Again by inspection you can

1101
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:41,079
infer

1102
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,960
immediately what the partial derivatives

1103
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:45,279
of this function are with respect to the

1104
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,599
various natural variables for example T

1105
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:49,680
is the partial of e with respect to S

1106
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:53,359
minus p is the partial of e with respect

1107
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:58,440
to V the chemical potential and this is

1108
01:03:53,359 --> 01:04:00,559
important is when viewed this way is the

1109
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,520
partial of e with respect to

1110
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:07,119
n and

1111
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:11,240
being a derivative of this function

1112
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:14,039
here it is viewed as a function of s of

1113
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,039
the same variable

1114
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:21,079
svnn then you do the same also for

1115
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,839
example for the say let's go down here

1116
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:26,079
to the Gibs free

1117
01:04:22,839 --> 01:04:28,319
energy the Gibs free energy

1118
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,920
has this form of the differential so you

1119
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:34,400
identify its natural variable as being

1120
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,400
temperature pressure and the

1121
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:40,119
amount and the partial

1122
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,799
derivatives minus s is the partial of G

1123
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:45,880
with respect to

1124
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:48,079
T volume is the partial of G with

1125
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,839
respect to pressure the chemical

1126
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,319
potential is the partial of G with

1127
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:56,200
respect to

1128
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:59,559
n and this way the chemical potential

1129
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:02,599
is viewed as a function of TP

1130
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:04,279
andn it's the same chemical potential we

1131
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:08,279
talking about the same system in a

1132
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:12,160
stable equilibrium state but you can

1133
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:14,200
view the chemical potential as function

1134
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,880
of different

1135
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:20,960
variables because the game of the lendra

1136
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:26,200
transformation is to change

1137
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:29,079
from uh not readily measurable variables

1138
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,119
like the entropy to more readily

1139
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:33,839
variable measurable variable like

1140
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:38,000
temperature pressure or for the free for

1141
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,000
the emal free energy temperature and

1142
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,200
volume the

1143
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:45,880
enthalpy doesn't gain much because it

1144
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,200
still has the entropy there but the

1145
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,760
enthalpy is is important for bulk flow

1146
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:55,200
interactions and that's why uh we keep

1147
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,200
it in uh in play

1148
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:04,559
now of course this is that

1149
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,640
summation but when we have a single uh

1150
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:12,119
substance so when we have a pure

1151
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:12,119
substance we have this same uh set of

1152
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:18,200
equations this is valid in general so

1153
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:22,039
including small

1154
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:26,480
systems it's the same as two slides

1155
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:31,960
before only that uh we we've

1156
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:34,039
written uh this as simply mu and N only

1157
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:38,640
one

1158
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:40,400
substance oh you could call it one one

1159
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:44,279
or actually

1160
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:47,200
here we are going to use the double

1161
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:51,680
subscript as a convention

1162
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:54,359
to um denote pure substance so if you

1163
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:58,640
see a double Subs subscrip it means we

1164
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:58,640
are referring to pure that

1165
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:12,200
constituent okay so in the larger um

1166
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,799
number of particle limits so the simple

1167
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,799
system approximation applies

1168
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:23,960
and we still have the oiler

1169
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:27,240
relation the GS the DM relation

1170
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:29,000
simplifies and can be be viewed as a

1171
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:32,799
essentially the

1172
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,319
differential of the chemical

1173
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:41,000
potential of the only substance that we

1174
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:44,119
have so you see that the chemical

1175
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,680
potential is a

1176
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:52,079
function of T and

1177
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:53,359
P let's see uh yeah uh here I think I

1178
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:56,880
made a

1179
01:07:53,359 --> 01:08:03,559
mistake in these

1180
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:08,440
um let's see in the limit in the large n

1181
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:12,160
limit uh the chemical potential

1182
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:15,279
loses its dependence on the amounts like

1183
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,279
okay here it is written

1184
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:21,319
correctly

1185
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:25,080
okay oh yeah okay here I did take it

1186
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:25,080
away fine

1187
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:34,719
uh so the chemical potential is

1188
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,719
not an

1189
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:41,480
independent property once you fix the

1190
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,279
temperature and the pressure chemical

1191
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,319
potential is a function of tnp so that

1192
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:50,000
fixes also the chemical

1193
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,000
potential whereas for a

1194
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,440
mixture the phase rule depending on

1195
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,799
uh how many phases you have coexisting

1196
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,400
and so

1197
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,040
on some chemical potentials can be

1198
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,040
changed

1199
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,279
independently not for the pure

1200
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,480
substance and in fact if you have for a

1201
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:23,600
pure substance two phases you have one

1202
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:26,159
relation like this for one phase like

1203
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:31,239
liquid and another relation like this

1204
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:31,239
for the vapor and if if they

1205
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,480
coexist the two must be

1206
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,679
equal and therefore not uh uh

1207
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:41,759
temperature and pressure are not even

1208
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:44,319
any more uh

1209
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,839
independently variable like when you

1210
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,839
have a single

1211
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,839
phase

1212
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:58,679
okay we will see that chemical

1213
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,679
potentials play an important role for

1214
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:06,320
mixtures because they determine the

1215
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,239
properties and they also play an import

1216
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,000
important role in determining the

1217
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:14,640
condition for Mutual

1218
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,640
equilibrium so they are really our

1219
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,480
Focus for the pure substance

1220
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:26,000
notice that due to the oiler relation

1221
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:31,560
the chemical potential is also

1222
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:36,120
equal to the specific Gibs free energy

1223
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:40,080
so the Gibs free energy per unit

1224
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,080
mole like

1225
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,760
see uh

1226
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,600
G

1227
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
is capital G Over

1228
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:00,239
N now in

1229
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:03,000
uh the uh simple system

1230
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,360
model for a mixture so this is the

1231
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
simple system

1232
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:09,000
model G is equal to that

1233
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:19,040
summation when you have only

1234
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:23,400
one that summation becomes just one term

1235
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:27,239
and therefore you see that the

1236
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,239
uh if you take G

1237
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:35,440
so it's new1 one And1 one divided by

1238
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:40,480
let's let me put one one

1239
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:45,199
here so that's new so that proves that

1240
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:49,880
in that case that gives a free energy uh

1241
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:49,880
molar so that's G11 is equal to

1242
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:55,199
mu11 only for a p substance

1243
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,880
okay so how do we measure

1244
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:13,320
properties well in order to

1245
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,120
measure we will see that we said that

1246
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,800
the chemical potentials are Central

1247
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,679
because they determine the for example

1248
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,840
the

1249
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:23,719
Gibs free energy which is a legan

1250
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,400
transform of this of the fundamental

1251
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:28,400
relation and therefore you can extract

1252
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:32,000
all the information from from it of

1253
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:34,159
course if you know it as a function so

1254
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,880
you need to know not just one value you

1255
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:39,440
need to know how it varies with

1256
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,800
temperature pressure you need to know

1257
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,719
all this function in order to

1258
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,719
characterize your your your

1259
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:55,280
mixture and the chemical

1260
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:59,159
potentials are uh the key of the game

1261
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,159
and the way you can measure

1262
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:07,400
them is by a a manometer by measuring

1263
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,400
the partial

1264
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:15,679
pressure so you need to

1265
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:20,840
develop uh rigid semi-permeable

1266
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:23,320
membranes capable of keeping the

1267
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,400
molecules all molecules in the mixture

1268
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:29,280
except one

1269
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:32,639
inside the mixture and allowing only

1270
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:36,880
some the molecules of one type to cross

1271
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:40,880
once you have identified a membrane like

1272
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:44,880
that you just wait

1273
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:47,440
for Mutual equilibrium to to to occur

1274
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,080
and then measure this partial pressure

1275
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,800
and then as you

1276
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:53,679
remember the condition for Mutual

1277
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,639
equilibrium is that the chemical

1278
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:59,400
potential of constituent I in the

1279
01:13:56,639 --> 01:14:01,960
mixture must be equal to the chemical

1280
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:06,080
potential of the constituent on the

1281
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:10,760
other side of the membrane through which

1282
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,760
that substance can be uh can

1283
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,800
flow and we call partial pressure that

1284
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,960
pressure at which that occurs the

1285
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,920
pressure of the pure system that uh so

1286
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:27,040
that that's the meaning of the double

1287
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:27,040
I and so this

1288
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:38,960
equality makes uh um

1289
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:40,639
the yeah okay here I kept because for

1290
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:45,120
small systems you also have this

1291
01:14:40,639 --> 01:14:49,840
dependence even for uh the pure

1292
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:51,800
substance but for large uh

1293
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,480
amounts that

1294
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,639
drops and then you see that the you can

1295
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,920
solve this equation and

1296
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,800
evaluated the partial pressure as a

1297
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:04,320
function of the other variables which is

1298
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:06,480
temperature pressure and the amounts in

1299
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,480
the

1300
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:13,520
mixture uh and the amount in this uh

1301
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:17,719
small syst in this pure system on the

1302
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:19,960
other side of the membrane but the the

1303
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:23,960
the absolute amounts drop out for large

1304
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:26,000
n so that dependence is only through the

1305
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:28,800
uh relative comp

1306
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,360
position of your mixture so the

1307
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:37,080
percentages of how much how many

1308
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:37,080
molecules of each type I have in my uh

1309
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,480
mixture and again

1310
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:50,239
here I

1311
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:54,239
use this relation which is also

1312
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:55,960
important uh to remember namely that

1313
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,760
therefore

1314
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:01,000
for large gen the chemical potential of

1315
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:03,800
the constituent in the mixture is equal

1316
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,480
to the chemical potential of the pure

1317
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,840
component evaluated at the temperature

1318
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,679
and the partial pressure of the mixture

1319
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,400
and the chemical potential of the pure

1320
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:16,840
component is given by the Gibs free

1321
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:20,960
energy and the Gibs free energy if you

1322
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:24,960
remember is also written as H minus

1323
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,960
TS so what we are saying is that can

1324
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,639
chemical

1325
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:31,920
potential of component in the mixture

1326
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:35,080
can be written as

1327
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,880
this but since this is G it can also be

1328
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,880
written as

1329
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:47,120
H

1330
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:55,480
uh I'm sorry this is new i h i t at the

1331
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:57,679
partial pressure minus t s i t

1332
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,520
P

1333
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,400
okay and

1334
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,719
this with double I are the properties of

1335
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,719
the pure

1336
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:16,320
substances so a good part but not

1337
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:19,840
all uh of the properties of the mixture

1338
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:23,560
are determined by the properties of the

1339
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,560
P the few components

1340
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:33,800
in fact we will uh Define

1341
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,800
some behaviors that we will call

1342
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:41,199
Ideal which are simplified version

1343
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:44,360
simplified models in which all of the

1344
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:46,320
properties uh of the mixtures of the

1345
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,560
mixture are

1346
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,920
determined uh by the properties of the

1347
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,159
pure

1348
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:58,760
components that is a is not to say

1349
01:17:53,159 --> 01:18:02,120
that the most most real mixtures are not

1350
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:06,199
ideal in the sense that we will try to

1351
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:08,120
Define uh but the ideal mixture model or

1352
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:12,840
the ideal solution

1353
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:12,840
models uh are a good

1354
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:17,960
start and

1355
01:18:15,159 --> 01:18:21,600
then the typical procedure is that to

1356
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:25,920
start with ideal description then since

1357
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,920
my actual mixture uh depart from

1358
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,800
ideal you

1359
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,639
describe the departure from

1360
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:37,440
ideal We call we going to call those

1361
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:37,440
excess uh

1362
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:54,080
properties now a first step towards the

1363
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:58,600
construction of properties of a mixture

1364
01:18:54,080 --> 01:19:01,410
from the property of the pure uh

1365
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:04,120
components is to

1366
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:07,199
[Music]

1367
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:11,120
Define I think we already done in yeah

1368
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:11,120
we defined already the partial

1369
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,840
properties the way we did

1370
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:25,040
it was to

1371
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:27,280
um okay uh right

1372
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,280
the

1373
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:35,239
differential of the

1374
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:39,480
expression that see this mui is

1375
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:45,440
also as we said a function of

1376
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:45,440
TP and the uh the

1377
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:54,360
amounts so we

1378
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:54,360
write the differential of that

1379
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,679
and then we use those Maxwell

1380
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,760
relations that allows us to for example

1381
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:07,280
this partial derivative of mu with

1382
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:09,880
respect to T which is the coefficient of

1383
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,560
DT in this

1384
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:16,960
differential we

1385
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:18,080
recognize that except for the minus sign

1386
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,840
is equal

1387
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:26,159
to the second derivative of of of

1388
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,880
G so of G of the capital G of the GI

1389
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,400
free

1390
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,159
energy with respect to T and with

1391
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,679
respect to n because the chemical

1392
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:37,960
potential is a partial of G with respect

1393
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:43,719
to n so this

1394
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:47,920
is the second derivative but then due to

1395
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:50,719
the um reciprocity or Schwarz theorem

1396
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:54,800
about second partial

1397
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:56,800
derivatives this can also be viewed as

1398
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,239
that you first do the the partial of G

1399
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,960
with respect to T and then with respect

1400
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:04,920
to n so the partial of G with respect to

1401
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:09,679
T is minus S as we can see from here

1402
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,679
partial of G with respect to T is minus

1403
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:15,040
s so by writing the differentials we go

1404
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:17,600
and do and

1405
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:20,280
watch uh by inspection what these

1406
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,400
partial derivatives are but also we

1407
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:26,120
should

1408
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:28,600
remember uh I mean we could remember uh

1409
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:31,199
by heart that the this partial

1410
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:34,719
derivatives at least this and

1411
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,719
that in any

1412
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:41,760
case this says how much the entropy

1413
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,360
changes if while keeping temperature and

1414
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:48,320
pressure fixed and also the various

1415
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:50,679
amounts I add a little bit of one

1416
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:54,080
substance this is why it takes the name

1417
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:58,320
partial entropy it's the contribution of

1418
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:00,760
that con of of of that constituent to uh

1419
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:04,040
the uh property

1420
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,040
of of the

1421
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:12,080
mixture then we do the same we did the

1422
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:14,360
same for this

1423
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:17,440
other partial derivatives which is the

1424
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,440
coefficient of the

1425
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:23,840
pressure which is here it can also be

1426
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,560
viewed as a second partial derivative of

1427
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,840
G

1428
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:30,639
therefore therefore it in this case it's

1429
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:34,840
the partial of the volume with respect

1430
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:37,679
to n so it says how much the volume

1431
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:41,040
changes increases if I add a little bit

1432
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:43,120
of substance I while keeping temperature

1433
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:47,120
pressure and the other constituents

1434
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:47,120
fixed that's called the partial

1435
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,320
volume we also

1436
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:01,280
here we

1437
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:04,040
have the expression for the differential

1438
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:08,360
I have to take care also of uh the

1439
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:08,360
different the differentials of the NS

1440
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:14,400
here so I have a summation because I

1441
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:16,960
have many NS I have this partial

1442
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,960
derivatives of chemical potential of one

1443
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:23,440
substance with respect to the amount of

1444
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,440
another substance

1445
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:29,560
and

1446
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,040
the

1447
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,320
uh reciprocity of second order

1448
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:36,639
derivatives tells us that there is a

1449
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:40,480
reciprocity in this

1450
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:42,800
relation and for short hand in what

1451
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,560
follows I'm going to denote these

1452
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:49,400
partial derivatives as Mu I comma J or

1453
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:54,639
mu J comma I so the comma I

1454
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,639
means partial with respect to ni

1455
01:23:55,719 --> 01:23:58,080
then

1456
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:05,880
using um for example this is the Gibbs

1457
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,880
relation differential of the fundamental

1458
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,400
relation uh I can

1459
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,960
compute the partial energy of

1460
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,880
constituent

1461
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,679
I because I can take

1462
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:24,400
formally I mean don't tell the

1463
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:26,800
mathematicians but if I take these

1464
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:31,920
expression here for the for the and I

1465
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,920
divide by Del partial n partial n

1466
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:43,159
i uh so I divide through so I so that

1467
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:46,600
becomes that d ided by dni is equal to T

1468
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:50,840
* DS /

1469
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:52,400
dni but that DS divided by dni is the

1470
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,679
partial

1471
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,560
entropy then I have d V ided by dni

1472
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,560
that's the partial

1473
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:03,880
volume and

1474
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:08,440
DN ided by dni is

1475
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:11,880
one dni divided by dni is one so that

1476
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:16,239
leaves me with just uh the chemical

1477
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:19,360
potential it's I mean it's one if the uh

1478
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:22,880
if the I am dividing is the same as the

1479
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:24,480
N if zero if I'm dividing one by the

1480
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,600
other

1481
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,840
because they are independent and so this

1482
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:31,480
is how we

1483
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:33,639
prove I mean you can do it better but

1484
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:36,440
just this was just sort of a game

1485
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:39,920
because formal sometimes proceeding

1486
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,880
formally is helpful to go fast and do

1487
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,679
some

1488
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,880
checking in any case so this is the

1489
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:49,920
expression for the partial

1490
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,760
energy of constituent and you can play

1491
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:56,040
the same game using the differential for

1492
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:58,119
the enthalpy to express the partial

1493
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:02,600
enthalpy of

1494
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:05,880
constituent what is important uh here is

1495
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:09,320
that all these partial properties

1496
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:09,320
entropy volume energy

1497
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,400
enthalpy

1498
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,600
are

1499
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:26,239
related to the chemical potential you

1500
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,239
see the chemical

1501
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:31,119
potential

1502
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:34,000
or partial derivatives of the chemical

1503
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:36,560
potential either with respect to T or

1504
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:40,000
with respect to

1505
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,000
P so that

1506
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:47,000
means that if I have this expression

1507
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:50,520
here I can

1508
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,119
determine by just mathematical

1509
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:55,520
manipulation all the partial properties

1510
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:59,880
of the constituent in the

1511
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,880
mixture okay so from this

1512
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:06,800
one I get

1513
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:12,480
si uh

1514
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,480
VI hi I EI

1515
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,920
and what do I do with

1516
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:34,159
them

1517
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:44,320
well this next slide is to show that

1518
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:48,280
uh with them you can

1519
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:52,000
compute the properties of the overall

1520
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,000
properties of the mixture

1521
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:06,920
so here I do it again for the general

1522
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:09,639
case and then in the uh I look at the

1523
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:12,639
large and

1524
01:28:09,639 --> 01:28:15,639
large um number of

1525
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,639
particles

1526
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:23,119
limit essentially

1527
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:27,280
we can

1528
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,800
take the expression

1529
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:39,520
for the oiler one this is one way of

1530
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:42,000
doing of

1531
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,920
course many different ways of getting to

1532
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,600
the same result for example in the

1533
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:50,480
book there is no discussion about the

1534
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:52,600
oiler

1535
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:56,040
U free

1536
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,040
energy and

1537
01:28:56,239 --> 01:29:01,360
so you find a different derivation

1538
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:05,800
starting from just the valid in the

1539
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:07,719
large limit large number of

1540
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:11,880
particles in any

1541
01:29:07,719 --> 01:29:14,440
case I start from the um expression for

1542
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:17,119
the oiler relation which is a function

1543
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:19,600
of TP and

1544
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:24,480
new and

1545
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:27,360
then substitute inside the MU here

1546
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,360
this expression

1547
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:34,320
here so that it becomes a function of TP

1548
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:42,199
andn and then I

1549
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:44,080
take the derivatives of

1550
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:46,199
um

1551
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:51,400
this with

1552
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:51,400
respect to these independent variables

1553
01:29:55,159 --> 01:29:58,880
of course we need to do some chain rule

1554
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:01,920
because here we have a function of a

1555
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:04,520
function so for

1556
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,480
example the derivative of EU with

1557
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:08,679
respect to

1558
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:11,760
T gets one contribution from the T that

1559
01:30:08,679 --> 01:30:14,480
is here this T

1560
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,800
here and that's the derivative with

1561
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:19,639
respect to

1562
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:23,480
T then when I think that the other

1563
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:28,280
variables so so let's say loely speaking

1564
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:30,719
at constant p and constant mu okay so I

1565
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:34,639
put a p and a mu

1566
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:37,360
here plus there is also a

1567
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:41,679
contribution to changes in temperature

1568
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:44,600
through the chemical potentials so that

1569
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:47,199
adds the partial of EU with respect to

1570
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,199
the chemical

1571
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,080
potentials times the derivative of the

1572
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:55,080
chemical potential with respect to

1573
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,080
temperature

1574
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:04,760
okay now it turns out that if we take if

1575
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:08,280
we look at the uh expression for the

1576
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:10,840
differential of the oiler uh free energy

1577
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,840
which is this

1578
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:17,600
one by inspection as usual we can

1579
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:20,719
extract the values of the partial

1580
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:25,159
derivatives for example minus s is equal

1581
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:26,560
to partial of uh Oiler

1582
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:28,920
over

1583
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,080
temperature volume is the partial of

1584
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:34,920
Oiler over

1585
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:38,560
pressure the amount of

1586
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,320
constituent is the negative of the oiler

1587
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,639
with respect to the chemical potential

1588
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:46,040
so this partial derivative partial of U

1589
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:49,840
EU with respect to chemical potential of

1590
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:52,000
constituent I while I keep

1591
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,360
fixed temperature pressure and the

1592
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,560
chemical potentials of all other

1593
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:59,400
constituents is equal to the negative of

1594
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:59,400
the amount of constituents I have in the

1595
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:09,159
mixture so this thing

1596
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:09,159
here is uh minus n

1597
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:15,480
i

1598
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:17,880
Okay then if I look in the previous

1599
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:21,679
slide and I look at the partial of mu

1600
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:26,679
respect to T at constant PN that's minus

1601
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:29,239
s that's negative of uh the partial

1602
01:32:26,679 --> 01:32:30,600
entropy so minus and minus cancel

1603
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:35,040
becomes a

1604
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:36,560
plus and so I have uh the summation of

1605
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,800
Ni *

1606
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:42,719
SI whereas the first derivative

1607
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:47,000
here is here

1608
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:49,719
it's it's minus S capital S it's the

1609
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,719
entropy of the

1610
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:56,800
mixture okay so I just if I now take

1611
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:59,360
this expression and rewrite it here it

1612
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:03,119
says that the entropy

1613
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:06,199
of the overall entropy of my mixture is

1614
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:08,760
equal to the weighted sum of the partial

1615
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:10,360
entropies weighted by the amounts with

1616
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,920
which the constituents are present in

1617
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:16,000
the

1618
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:17,880
mixture minus a correcting term that has

1619
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:23,840
to

1620
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:23,840
do with um the oiler

1621
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:28,920
free

1622
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:32,320
energy but if we are not interested in

1623
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:35,239
small systems the oiler free energy is

1624
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,080
is zero and so in that limit only the

1625
01:33:35,239 --> 01:33:39,239
first

1626
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:42,880
term uh

1627
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:42,880
remains and so we

1628
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,560
obtain that if I have these SI with them

1629
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:55,480
I can

1630
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:55,480
compute the properties of my mixture

1631
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,239
so I know the entropy of my

1632
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:05,159
mixture and here you can play the same

1633
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:08,880
game also for the

1634
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:08,880
volume me skip

1635
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:17,239
this we can play the same game also with

1636
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:19,960
respect when I do the partial derivative

1637
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:23,600
of Oiler with respect to the amounts of

1638
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,600
one of the constituents

1639
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,840
if you do carefully the derivatives as

1640
01:34:30,199 --> 01:34:32,840
we are doing

1641
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:38,440
here this becomes equal to this

1642
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,040
summation which is written here

1643
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:49,560
again and since in the large limit

1644
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:56,040
uh oil is equal to Z to zero identically

1645
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:59,639
it means that this summation is equal to

1646
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:02,440
zero ident identically actually there

1647
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:04,880
are there are as many there is there is

1648
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:07,800
one for each constituent because you

1649
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:12,600
see there is a summation over the

1650
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:16,480
constituents I so I is a dummy index in

1651
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:20,080
within the summation but then there is a

1652
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:24,639
j which is a free so this has to be

1653
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:27,159
equal to zero for every J this is called

1654
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:30,159
the DM

1655
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:30,159
margules

1656
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:38,320
relation and we it will play some

1657
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:41,520
role in uh making sure that when you

1658
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:44,199
develop models you're doing it

1659
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,639
consistently for the moment we leave it

1660
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:49,400
there now in the next slide I'm going

1661
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:52,000
to

1662
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:54,320
start from these three so the first

1663
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:58,600
these three lines become the first

1664
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:58,600
lines uh

1665
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:03,119
here

1666
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:14,840
because from these relations I can

1667
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:17,520
prove similar relations also for all the

1668
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:21,480
other properties that we have talked

1669
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:25,320
about energy elol free energy GES free

1670
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:25,320
energy enalia

1671
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:41,840
so that means we can for all these in

1672
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,800
and also I can go it can go on to

1673
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,480
F

1674
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,840
G

1675
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:52,199
H

1676
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:55,760
okay uh I have relations like like

1677
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:58,840
that if I want them for the mixture all

1678
01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:00,760
I need to do is play some derivatives of

1679
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,840
the chemical

1680
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:06,600
potentials and with the proper relation

1681
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,480
I get to the relation to the property of

1682
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,719
of the mixture of course I need to also

1683
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:13,679
know the

1684
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:15,320
amounts so I need to know the chemical

1685
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,679
potentials how they depend on

1686
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:20,360
temperature pressure and amounts and I

1687
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:23,360
need to know how many I have in my

1688
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,360
mixture

1689
01:37:26,679 --> 01:37:34,000
yeah I think time is up so we could stop

1690
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:34,000
uh here
