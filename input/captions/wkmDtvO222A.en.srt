1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,839
So here the way to think about modular

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,960
arithmetic is that it's about

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,720
relationships between numbers. So some

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
of these you've already seen before and

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,720
are pretty familiar. So for example, if

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,199
I take an even number and add an odd

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,840
number to it, then I definitely get an

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,160
odd number. And if I take an even number

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,480
and add an even number, I get an even

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,360
number. So even though these things are

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,640
familiar even from elementary school,

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,719
you know, we're going to talk about

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,440
generalizations and go a lot further

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,920
with these ideas. Really, the way to

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,239
think about this simple example is it's

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,320
what's called arithmetic modulo 2. So by

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,000
that I mean you're doing arithmetic, but

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,280
you're only keeping track of the

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,199
remainders when you divide by two.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,399
So, you know, for today's lecture, we're

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,840
going to have the following key

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,960
definition that's going to take this

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:10,200
idea much further, which is we're going

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,200
to say that two integers A and B,

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:21,920
well, we're going to write the following

26
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:24,479
expression A congruent to B mod N.

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,920
So, this is pronounced as A congruent to

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:35,479
B mod N. And we'll write this expression

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,479
if and only if A and B differ

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,560
by a multiple event.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,920
So that's it. That's our key definition

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,280
that we're going to explore today. But

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
we're going to see that there's a lot of

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
meat to this in terms of you know

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
understanding how to work with modular

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,640
arithmetic.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,360
So another way that you'll sometimes

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,759
hear module arithmetic described is as

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,159
clock math. So I'll explain what that

40
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,320
metaphor means in a minute. But let me

41
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,360
tell you the you know key result that

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,680
we're going to use to reason about uh

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
you know modular arithmetic. And this

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,879
will also be something that's you know

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,239
familiar from long ago.

46
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,640
But we're going to state this a little

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,720
bit precisely. This is really a

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,080
corollary of you know what you learned

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,840
in elementary school namely long form

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,640
division. So what I claim is that you

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,640
know for any integers

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,080
a

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,080
and n where n is

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,840
strictly positive because it's our

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:53,640
divisor. What I claim is that there is

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,640
a unique pair

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,560
of again integers

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,440
Q and R and these are suggestively

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,920
chosen because Q is the quotient and R

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
is the remainder with the following

61
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,519
property.

62
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:20,400
We can write a as q * n plus r. And the

63
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,319
crucial thing is that this remainder

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,319
r is between zero and n and cannot be as

65
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,040
large as n. So it's really between 0 and

66
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,799
n minus one. So this is really the

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,879
correlary of what we learned in you know

68
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,319
elementary school about long form

69
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,920
division. I can take any integer a and

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,319
some divisor n and I can write a as q

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,560
multiples of n and then whatever I have

72
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,640
left over and the crucial thing is what

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,519
I have left over is an integer between

74
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,440
zero and n minus one. Though these are

75
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
just the basic facts that'll help us

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,799
make sense of modular arithmetic.

77
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,360
And you know let's go over some you know

78
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,000
basic facts about you know digesting

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920
what this expression means. you know

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
what are all the equivalent ways to

81
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,959
think about what this expression is

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,480
saying that a is congruent to b. So what

83
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
we're going to do is we're gonna you

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
know learn the language of modular

85
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,320
arithmetic. It's a little bit like you

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,320
know relearning arithmetic from scratch

87
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
but trying to remember what rules you're

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,040
still allowed to do and what rules

89
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,720
change. So you know let's be careful

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,800
with this. Uh let's prove our first key

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
fact and this will be an extremely

92
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
powerful fact.

93
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,759
So what I claim is that this expression

94
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,280
a is congruent to b mod n.

95
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,800
Well, we know what this expression

96
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,639
means. A and b differ by multiple of n.

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,560
I claim that this is true if and only if

98
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,840
the remainder

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:57,759
of a divided by n equals the remainder

100
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,400
of b when I divide by n.

101
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,520
So this is a very intuitive fact right

102
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,400
this is what was going on right here is

103
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,919
that um you know we think about evens as

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,479
being a set of numbers that are

105
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,479
congruent mod 2 and that's if and only

106
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,880
if the remainder when I divide by two is

107
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,039
zero and something is odd if and only if

108
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,280
its remainder is one when I divide by

109
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,160
two but this is true for modular

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,400
arithmetic even more generally than this

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,759
so this gives us you know a powerful way

112
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,280
that we'll use this fact later uh to

113
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,680
great effect for talking about the

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,039
uklitian algorithm but for right now

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,280
let's just make sure that uh we're on uh

116
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,759
the same page and that we can understand

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,720
why this fact is true. So we can prove

118
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,560
both directions of this implication. So

119
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,280
let's prove the backwards direction. So

120
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,280
let's suppose

121
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:03,520
that you know a is equal to qn plus r

122
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,280
and that b is equal to q prime n + r. So

123
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,720
r is their remainder. So I'm just

124
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,919
assuming that the remainder of a / n is

125
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,080
the same as the remainder of b / n

126
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,720
because they both have the same extra

127
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,720
term for the remainder.

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,880
And now you know what we can do is we

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,319
can just remember what this expression

130
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,880
means right we can look at a minus b the

131
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:32,080
difference between a and b and we can

132
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,560
write this as q - q prime * n and the rs

133
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,960
cancel. So this gives us what we're

134
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,759
looking for, right? The statement that a

135
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,600
and b are congruent mod n is equivalent

136
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,560
to the statement right here that their

137
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,160
difference is an integer multiple of n

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,120
and q minus q prime is an integer. So

139
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,720
we're good. We proved one direction. Uh

140
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,479
so this proves you know the first

141
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,600
implication that if the remainders are

142
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,400
the same then they're congruent mod n

143
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,919
and we can prove the converse direction

144
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,400
too. So conversely

145
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:13,919
let's suppose that a is equal to qn plus

146
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,759
r and b is equal to q prime n + rp

147
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,479
prime.

148
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,080
Now you know since

149
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,880
a a is congruent to b mod n we know that

150
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,840
a minus b is supposed to be equal to an

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,360
integer multiple of n. And then we can

152
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,840
remember what a and b are by assumption.

153
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:41,759
And we can write this out as q - q prime

154
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,400
* n plus r - r prime. Right? And so now

155
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,960
we can just focus on this expression. We

156
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,479
know that a minus b is a multiple of n.

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,120
And we can write the expression

158
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,599
alternatively this way. But the key

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,919
point is what's happening right here.

160
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,160
That this term right here r - rp prime

161
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,360
is an integer that's strictly larger

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:08,720
than minus n and strictly smaller than

163
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:11,280
n. So if k you know if uh a minus b can

164
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,319
be divided through by n, we get you know

165
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,400
some integer multiple. The only choice,

166
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,039
you know, n divides evenly here and we

167
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,720
get an integer. The only way that a

168
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,039
number that's between minus n and n and

169
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,960
is strict, these inequalities are strict

170
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,199
and it divides through and gets an

171
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,360
integer is if r - r prime equals zero,

172
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,640
in which case the two remainders are the

173
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,120
same.

174
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,599
So that's our you know key fact right

175
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
here is just that we can use the

176
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,399
division algorithm to connect very

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
nicely with modular arithmetic. The

178
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,959
statement that you know two numbers are

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,959
congruent mod n is really a statement

180
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,240
about you know what happens when we run

181
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,680
the division algorithm on a versus b. We

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,000
might get different quotients but they

183
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,279
better have the same remainder. So are

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,519
there any questions? Does this make

185
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,360
sense?

186
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:09,519
Yeah. Okay. All right. So now, you know,

187
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:14,120
let's think about how we can uh,

188
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,120
you know, visualize what's going on.

189
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,519
So the visual to keep in your head

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,040
is of a clock. So we can think about

191
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,839
something like 12, which is congruent to

192
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:36,000
five mod 7. And what's really going on

193
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:39,200
is that we take the integers 0 to six

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,519
and we put them evenly spread out along

195
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,519
our clock.

196
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,000
And now what's going on is when we take

197
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,880
an integer like five, we start off at

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
zero and we go around the clock until we

199
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,040
hit five. And if we take an integer like

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,080
12, we go around the clock, but we're

201
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,200
going to loop one full time around and

202
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,640
we'll end up at the same exact place. So

203
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,440
that's sometimes why you'll hear it

204
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,680
referred to as clock math is because,

205
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,200
you know, unlike ordinary integers here,

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
we're not actually distinguishing

207
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,720
between 12 and five. These are in the

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
same equivalence class because they land

209
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,200
on the same position when we go around

210
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
the clock.

211
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
So this is you know the basics of

212
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,160
modular arithmetic but so far we've only

213
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,320
talked about addition. So the other

214
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,320
piece we should talk about is you know

215
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,320
multiplication

216
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
and then we can get to some action. So

217
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,040
when we think about modular arithmetic,

218
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:52,040
we already know how to uh you know add

219
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,040
and we can also ask how we multiply

220
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,920
modulo n.

221
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,040
So it turns out that you can kind of

222
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:11,519
just do it. So if I have something like

223
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:13,839
10 is congruent to three again modulo 7

224
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,640
I can multiply this by 12 which is

225
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,560
congruent to five modulo 7. And one

226
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,360
thing you can check is that you can just

227
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,720
you know do multiplication as usual

228
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,800
right you can multiply 12 by 10 and I

229
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:35,120
get 120 and on my right hand side I get

230
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:39,760
15 right but really 15 is congruent to

231
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,920
one modulo 7 because I can take away two

232
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,480
multiples of seven and get back down to

233
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,640
one. So basically when you're doing

234
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,120
addition and multiplication

235
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,040
you can always just you know multiply

236
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,920
and add the way that you're familiar

237
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,320
with just at the end after you're done

238
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,959
you take out as many integer multiples

239
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,839
of you know the modulus as you need to

240
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,200
to get back to an integer that's between

241
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,160
zero and n minus one. So a lot of things

242
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,320
work out you know very nicely. But you

243
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,200
know the way to think about this really

244
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,639
is you know um if you were to try and

245
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,079
unwrap what's behind this notation the

246
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,399
statement that uh you know 10 * 12

247
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:29,160
modulo 7 is congruent to one right is

248
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,160
really the statement that a number

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,880
with remainder

250
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:42,079
three all happening modul

251
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,399
7 times

252
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,399
a number

253
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,920
with

254
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,920
remainder

255
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,720
five modulo7

256
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,959
gives a number

257
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,240
with remainder one

258
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,240
all modulo

259
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,720
So it's good to not get confused by

260
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,959
what's happening in terms of this

261
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,920
expression, right? What this expression

262
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,720
really means when I take any number like

263
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,720
some number like 10 whose remainder is

264
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:33,120
three modulo 7 and I take any number say

265
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,200
12 whose remainder is five mod 7 and I

266
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,480
take the product of those two numbers I

267
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,120
get this number on my left hand side 120

268
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,720
and that number should have remainder

269
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,720
one when I take it with the modulus 7.

270
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
So that's really what's going on is it's

271
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,440
the same, you know, generalization of

272
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,600
what I wrote down right here is that you

273
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
can forget what the actual even number

274
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,519
was. All that matters is what its

275
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,440
modulus is, mod 2. I can forget what my

276
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,040
odd number is. All that matters is that

277
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,560
it has remainder one modulo 2. And I can

278
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,320
still tell you something about the

279
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,800
remainder when I add up those two

280
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,720
numbers even though I've forgotten the

281
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,680
rest of the action of like how many

282
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,320
times around the clock I've gone. So

283
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,839
that's the key way to think about it. So

284
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
you know if you've seen it before this

285
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,240
is very easy. Uh if you haven't seen it

286
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,399
this is, you know, takes a little bit of

287
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,399
wrapping your head around. So are there

288
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,199
any questions about modular arithmetic

289
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,199
or does this make sense?

290
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
Good.

291
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
Okay.

292
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,680
So, you know, I'm trying to give you a

293
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,920
lot of different ways to think about it.

294
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,240
Uh, I'll also mention that you can think

295
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,040
about these things abstractly too,

296
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,120
right? So, we'll talk more about this in

297
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,240
the next lecture, but when I'm working

298
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,320
modulo 7, then I can really think about

299
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,800
it as uh something called a group that

300
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,880
we'll talk a lot more about. And really,

301
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,360
I can just think about the elements of

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,320
that as being all of the possible

303
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,480
remainders. And I have this table of how

304
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,440
exactly to add up two numbers that

305
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,519
belong to this set. Because when I add

306
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,800
up remainders of zero, I get back to

307
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,360
zero. When I add up two with two, I get

308
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,120
back to a remainder of four. But see, I

309
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,600
have interesting things happening here.

310
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,000
When I take four and I add four, I go

311
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,680
back to the element one because that's

312
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,480
the new remainder I would get when I

313
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,480
take it modulo 7.

314
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,959
And the same type of thing happens here.

315
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,399
This is our multiplication table. You

316
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,560
know, when I take something like 3 * 3,

317
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,800
that'll give me 9. And when I subtract

318
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,360
off the multiples of seven, I'm going to

319
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,920
get back to two. So, really, what's

320
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,639
going on is that uh we're just redoing

321
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,880
our addition and multiplication tables

322
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,399
just in the context of only keeping

323
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,160
track of what the remainders are.

324
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
Make sense?

325
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,480
All right.

326
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,279
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

327
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,920
tell you some more basic facts about

328
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,920
modular arithmetic and then we're going

329
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,839
to do a demo

330
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,920
um just to give you a bit of a hint

331
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,839
about why modular arithmetic is

332
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,320
important.

333
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,399
So you know as I promised many of the

334
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,720
things that you're used to with ordinary

335
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:26,079
arithmetic go through just the same and

336
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll point out the things that don't. So

337
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,800
one of the properties that we know and

338
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,600
love is associivity. If I have some

339
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,720
number you know modulo 7, I can add two

340
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,160
numbers B and C modulo7

341
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,600
and then I can add to their result A all

342
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,600
happening mod 7 and I claim that that's

343
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,320
the same thing as parenthesizing the

344
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,519
expression in the other way. It's the

345
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:00,160
same thing as you know a plus b and then

346
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,800
I add c all happening mod 7.

347
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,559
Um a lot of the other basic facts we're

348
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,559
used to go through as well like

349
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,559
commutativity.

350
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:19,919
So in particular a + b modulo 7 is equal

351
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,160
to b + a. You know, that's the same

352
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,480
thing as like even plus odd. It doesn't

353
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
matter what order I add them up, I still

354
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,919
get the same thing, which is an odd

355
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,200
number.

356
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,400
And, you know, last but not least,

357
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,919
we still have the distributive property,

358
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
which tells us, you know, how

359
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,440
multiplication and addition interact. So

360
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,600
if I'm multiplying over Z7, a * the

361
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:52,160
result of B + C, that's the same thing

362
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:56,799
as A * B plus

363
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,200
A * C. So almost everything works

364
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,280
exactly the way that you're used to,

365
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,960
right?

366
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,880
All right. So, you know, before we go

367
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
too far into modular arithmetic, because

368
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,799
we're going to be doing a lot of it

369
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,840
today, I wanted to give you a little bit

370
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,320
of a teaser for later about why we care

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,400
about modular arithmetic. So, it's not

372
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,640
totally obvious, but you know, modular

373
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,559
arithmetic is a great way to accomplish

374
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
a lot of things, especially in computer

375
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,120
science. So, we talked a bit about, you

376
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,679
know, areas like cryptography in a

377
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,840
previous lecture. Um, you know,

378
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
cryptography is based on modular

379
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,120
arithmetic. So this will be a very

380
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,200
important application for us later in

381
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,080
the class. There are also some other

382
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,799
really fun applications that uh also are

383
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,919
from other areas of cryptography which

384
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,559
have to do with things which are

385
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,440
actually invented here at MIT about zero

386
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,520
knowledge proofs. So uh I'm going to

387
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,720
need some help from the audience for

388
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,440
this one. But you know let's imagine

389
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,760
that uh you're home on a weekend and you

390
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,720
want to watch an embarrassing movie with

391
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,880
your friend. Now you have some favorite

392
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
movies you might want to see, but you

393
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,720
don't want to admit to, you know, liking

394
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,799
that movie unless your friend likes it

395
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,799
too. I mean, this is a common problem,

396
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,480
right? You know, maybe if you both like

397
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,880
the same embarrassing movie, you would

398
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,559
then watch it and that's fine. But

399
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,720
otherwise, you know, if you don't both

400
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,280
want to watch the movie, you want some

401
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,440
kind of plausible deniability, right? I

402
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,679
don't like that movie, right? So, what

403
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,320
are some examples of embarrassing movies

404
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,960
that uh you guys actually like that you

405
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,360
might be a little embarrassed to admit?

406
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,360
Don't be shy.

407
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,400
You guys don't like any embarrassing

408
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
movies.

409
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,343
What? [laughter]

410
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,400
We can't move on with the lecture until

411
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,400
you guys give me something here.

412
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,480
>> I don't have any.

413
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,640
>> Okay. What are embarrassing movies? Your

414
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,240
friends like

415
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
your friends might like

416
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
>> Shrek.

417
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
>> Shrek.

418
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,960
>> Shrek is good.

419
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,080
>> Shrek's okay. All right.

420
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
>> Barbie maybe.

421
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,360
>> Barbie. Okay.

422
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,559
>> Barbie movie is great. [laughter]

423
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
>> All right. We're going to have a fight

424
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,760
breakout.

425
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
>> Like this is just the correct answer. I

426
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
think

427
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,840
>> Morbby. I have no idea what that is.

428
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,480
>> It's like constant. [cough]

429
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,440
>> Okay.

430
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,240
>> Because it's so bad.

431
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,160
>> Okay. MorbiiUs.

432
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,120
>> Oh, wait. The room.

433
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,400
>> The room. Okay. The room. Uh, I was

434
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,240
gonna go with what's this? Uh, okay. I

435
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,120
don't know. [laughter]

436
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,960
Um, all right. Let's go with Morbius.

437
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,240
So, uh, can I have two volunteers from

438
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
the audience and then I'll explain the

439
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,000
game?

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Who's going to come up here? Don't be

441
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,320
shy. Yeah. All right. One more. Let's do

442
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,240
it. All right. So, let's explain how,

443
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,679
you know, modular arithmetic and clock

444
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,080
math is going to help us, you know,

445
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,640
answer this question. Uh, what I'm going

446
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,200
to do is I'm going to take five cards.

447
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,760
Three are red, two are black. Let's

448
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,440
pretend that I don't keep track of like,

449
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,840
you know, the fact that it's a two, and

450
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,679
I just know the color of it. So, what

451
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,039
I'm going to do is I'm going to give

452
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,320
each of you uh one black and one red

453
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,880
card. Okay? And then what's going to

454
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,640
happen is I put down this one red card

455
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
in the middle. Now, what they're going

456
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
to do is they're going to decide whether

457
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,679
they like the embarrassing movie or not,

458
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
which they want to see on the weekends,

459
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,919
which I guess is MorbiiUs, which I

460
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,039
should look up after class. And if they

461
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
like it, what they're going to do is

462
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,640
they're going to put their red card

463
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,280
closest to the red card in the middle

464
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
and their black card on the outside. And

465
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,640
if they don't like it, they're going to

466
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,840
put their black card next to the red

467
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,760
card and their red card on the outside.

468
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,600
Okay? And so what I'm going to do then

469
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,400
is I'm going to stack up the cards on

470
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,360
top of each other. And then I'm going to

471
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,760
have them both cut the deck randomly. So

472
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,400
that way it's a random cyclic shift when

473
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,159
they put it together. And then what I

474
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,000
claim is that, you know, if they both

475
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,760
like the movie MorbiiUs and they want to

476
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,080
see it, what's going to happen is we're

477
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,919
going to have two red cards in a row

478
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,559
cyclally.

479
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,880
And if either of them doesn't like it,

480
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,640
right? Then we will not have three red

481
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,200
cards in a row. We will have two red

482
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,200
cards in a row. But even the person who

483
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,880
claim who liked it and the other person

484
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,679
didn't, they'll have plausible

485
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,159
deniability because all of those, you

486
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,720
know, after the cyclic shifts, it'll all

487
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,880
look the same. So, let's try it out. Do

488
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,000
you guys want to see MorbiiUs over

489
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,320
spring break? So, I won't look. Put down

490
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,679
your cards and then we'll see if uh

491
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,480
we've got a match.

492
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,640
All right. And just for security

493
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,280
purposes, I'm going to ask each of you

494
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,799
just to cut the deck. So, just take up,

495
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
you know, some number of cards and put

496
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,480
them on the bottom.

497
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,039
Perfect.

498
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,280
And then cut the deck randomly. We'll

499
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,760
pretend we didn't see how they cut them.

500
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,679
And what I'll do is I'll put them out in

501
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,440
order.

502
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,600
And unfortunately, we don't have a

503
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,880
match. So, uh, can you tell me what you

504
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,480
guys answered?

505
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,039
>> Oh, I answered no.

506
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,360
>> Uhhuh.

507
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,120
>> Yes.

508
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,840
>> You put yes. It's okay. So even though

509
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,240
he put yes, he can save face and say I I

510
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,600
never like that movie anyways. So this

511
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,720
is what's called the zero knowledge

512
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,039
proof. Thanks for your help. Um and you

513
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,360
know it uses just clock math types of

514
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,280
things. So it turns out that you know

515
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,960
once we have the basics of modular

516
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,280
arithmetic there'll be some amazing

517
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,600
things we can do with it like being able

518
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,240
to privately compute functions, be able

519
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,679
to execute cryptographic schemes. But

520
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,360
for this lecture, what we're going to be

521
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,000
doing is we're just going to be building

522
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,000
up the basic mechanics before we can

523
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,960
apply it in action in some of the later

524
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,320
lectures in class.

525
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,080
Okay, so now um let's roll up our

526
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,520
sleeves. You know, all of this stuff was

527
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,840
pretty natural. Um you know, it it works

528
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,280
kind of the way you would expect it to.

529
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,320
But now we're going to get into, you

530
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,080
know, one piece of the puzzle that, you

531
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,720
know, makes it really interesting and

532
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,360
different than ordinary integer

533
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,679
arithmetic. So, let me tell you the key

534
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,559
question which we're going to spend a

535
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,120
few minutes answering.

536
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,559
Um, you know, what I claim is if I look

537
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,720
at that, uh, you know, table, I'm going

538
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,559
to have some examples of, you know,

539
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
elements that have multiplicative

540
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,320
inverses.

541
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,880
I'll tell you what I mean by that. But

542
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,679
my key question is going to be when I'm

543
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,279
working say mod 7, does every element

544
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,400
have

545
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,400
a multiplicative inverse?

546
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,880
So let me be concrete. So let's say

547
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,159
we're working mod 7 for you know the

548
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,039
time being. We can take two and four and

549
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,640
we can multiply them. And as usual, the

550
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,960
way we do modular arithmetic with

551
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,799
multiplication is we just kind of do it

552
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,520
and then subtract off the multiples of

553
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,760
seven later. So when I take the element

554
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,480
two and I multiply it by the element

555
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,080
four, what I get is I get the element

556
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,480
one. Right? So that's an example of a

557
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,720
multiplicative inverse.

558
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,679
Because what's going on is if I have a

559
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,760
number multiplied by four, I can get rid

560
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,480
of it by multiplying the whole thing by

561
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,279
two, the two and the four will cancel

562
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,840
because they multiply to one and then I

563
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,760
get back the thing I started with. So

564
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,640
this is the key to a lot of what we're

565
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,240
going to be doing later

566
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,960
cryptographically

567
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,840
is because you know multiplying by a

568
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
number in modular arithmetic serves of

569
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,320
jumbling up the numbers you started

570
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,279
with. So I might have some secret

571
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,919
message and then I want to jumble it and

572
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,480
I could try multiplying by some other

573
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,360
number like four. But then I have to

574
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,919
have some way of unjumbling and in this

575
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,679
case that's a multiplicative inverse.

576
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,840
Now that scheme is not literally going

577
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,159
to work but that's the intuition behind

578
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,799
what's going on. So in this case you

579
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,640
know I got lucky or maybe I didn't that

580
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,640
you know when I multiplied by four there

581
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,679
was a multiplicative inverse which is

582
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,679
two. Does two have a multiplicative

583
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,440
inverse?

584
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,520
What is it?

585
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,039
>> Four. That's right. Because of

586
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,600
commutivity, it doesn't matter what

587
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,440
order I multiply them in. So two and

588
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,320
four are each other's multiplicative

589
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,000
inverses. You know, I could look at my

590
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,400
table and write down the full table of

591
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,200
all of the elements, right? And I could

592
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,520
check that, you know, every number has

593
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,000
some kind of multiplicative inverse,

594
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,240
right? like five has a multiplicative

595
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
inverse of three and if this table

596
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,960
continued three would be the

597
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,679
multiplicative inverse of five but when

598
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,840
I get to larger and larger moduli it's

599
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,440
not always possible to write down this

600
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,360
gigantic table and verify that in each

601
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,960
row there is some column where it's got

602
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,520
a one right and so what I can ask is you

603
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,240
know whether every element and by this I

604
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,960
mean just to be clear I mean every

605
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,480
nonzero element

606
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,200
zero won't have a multiplicative

607
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,159
inverse. But does every nonzero element

608
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,080
have a multiplicative inverse?

609
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,120
So this will be a key question which

610
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,880
occupies us for um a little bit of the

611
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,799
rest of the lectures answering this

612
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,840
question because we're going to build up

613
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,640
some mathematical theory of not only why

614
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,320
does every element have a multiplicative

615
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,320
inverse when we work modulo a prime but

616
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,679
how exactly I would find it without

617
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,840
actually writing down the entire table.

618
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,400
So that's our plan of action and uh you

619
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,559
know let's go back to

620
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,480
uh we're going to use this fact I

621
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,520
mentioned the fact that a is congruent

622
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,919
to b mod n if and only if the remainders

623
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,279
are equal. We're going to use this to

624
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,240
great effect. So let's just uh start

625
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,320
with some very natural definitions and

626
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,960
um it'll lead us to the answer to this

627
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,880
key question. So first of all I'm going

628
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,120
to define another key quantity which is

629
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,120
called the GCD the greatest common

630
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,120
divisor.

631
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:22,559
So if you give me two integers a and b

632
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,480
well the greatest common divisor is what

633
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,480
you think it is. It's the largest

634
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,919
integer

635
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,919
that divides both.

636
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay, so it could be one for example if

637
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,240
there's no integer larger than one that

638
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,360
divides both. But we'll take this as you

639
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,520
know our definition the GCD.

640
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,480
And you know really it's not so obvious

641
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,399
right now but um you know the following

642
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,039
question is going to help us answer this

643
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,679
problem about multiplicative inverses.

644
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:07,559
So you know I can ask the question how

645
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,559
can we compute the GCD?

646
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,720
So there's a terrible way to do this

647
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,120
which is I could just take the smaller

648
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,760
of the two integers. Let's say it's a

649
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,120
and I could try all the integers between

650
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,039
one and a and check. You know that might

651
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,520
work for small numbers but that's you're

652
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,600
going to have a very hard time once you

653
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,080
start working with gigantic numbers

654
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,559
things that are like 32 digits because

655
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,880
I'll just have to try too many things.

656
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,440
What I claim is that there's a very fast

657
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,440
algorithm for computing the GCD. In

658
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,520
fact, it's one of the first algorithms

659
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,000
that was ever discovered. So, it goes

660
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,000
back to the ancient Greeks. And we're

661
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,120
going to build up to, you know, this

662
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,559
algorithm with a few key structural

663
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,880
lemmas about how the GCD works. So,

664
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,679
let's start with the first lema. So,

665
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,080
let's assume that B is at least as large

666
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,360
as A without loss generality otherwise

667
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,760
we just switch them. What I claim is

668
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,039
that the GCD, the greatest common

669
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,240
divisor between A and B is actually the

670
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:19,039
same as the GCD

671
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,279
between A and B minus A.

672
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,600
So this is our first notion of progress.

673
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,799
We start off with two huge integers A

674
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,440
and B. We want to compute their GCD. And

675
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:33,120
I claim that their GCD is the same as,

676
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,200
you know, two not quite as huge integers

677
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,240
because now, you know, potentially I've

678
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,279
made one of the integers smaller.

679
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,120
So this is our first notion of progress.

680
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,520
Uh once we have this lema, we'll be able

681
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,080
to make a ton of progress. But let's

682
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,000
start by proving this lema and then

683
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,320
we'll prove a souped-up version of this

684
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,360
lema.

685
00:30:52,320 --> 00:31:00,399
So the proof for this is very simple. Um

686
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,720
let's suppose

687
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:09,360
that K divides A. This is the expression

688
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:12,480
for K divides A evenly into an integer.

689
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:18,840
So A is a multiple of K. And let's

690
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,840
assume that K also divides B.

691
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,360
Then um you know what I claim

692
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:35,279
is that K must also divide B minus A.

693
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,919
Why is that true? Well, what does this

694
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,799
mean? When I take A / K, I get an

695
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,919
integer. When I take B / K, I get an

696
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,399
integer. And so then if I take K, if I

697
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,480
take B minus A and divide it by K, I get

698
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,600
an integer minus an integer. So I

699
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:56,120
definitely still get an integer, right?

700
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,120
But let's think about what this means.

701
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,240
What this means for us

702
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:07,120
is that the GCD

703
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:11,120
of A and B is a lower bound for the GCD

704
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,279
of A and B minus A.

705
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,159
So this part is easy. I know that K

706
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,720
divides B minus A. How did I get to this

707
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,480
statement right here? How does you know

708
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,760
interpreting the statement tell me that

709
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,720
the GC whatever the gcd is for a and b

710
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:32,279
the gcd of a and b minus a is at least

711
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,279
as large? Can anyone help me out?

712
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:42,440
So you're up to here. How did I get this

713
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,440
statement? How did it follow from this?

714
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,880
Any ideas?

715
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,559
Let me give you a hint. So mechanically,

716
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,360
you know, I'm not telling you I know

717
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,880
what the GCD of A and B is. I'm telling

718
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,080
you whatever the GCD is, let's suppose

719
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,039
it's some integer K. That the GCD

720
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,320
between B and and uh between A and B

721
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:18,480
minus A must be at least as large.

722
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:21,919
How can I guarantee that fact

723
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,640
or ask a question? So either give me an

724
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,519
idea or ask me a clarifying question.

725
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,880
But this is important.

726
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,159
>> Prove that anything.

727
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,720
>> Yes. Perfect. So one way to think about

728
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,159
this is what am I saying here? Whatever

729
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,600
this GCD is, let's imagine that it's K,

730
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,640
right?

731
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,519
Well, then I know that K, you know, from

732
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,360
the statement, you know, if K divides

733
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,080
both A and B, then K must also divide A

734
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,840
and B minus A. That's literally what I

735
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,559
just proved. So that means that K also,

736
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,760
you know, is a candidate for a divisor

737
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,559
for A and B minus A. So whatever the

738
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,640
greatest common divisor is, it must be

739
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,079
at least as large. it must be you know

740
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,599
maybe there's something even bigger than

741
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,119
K but I know it's at least K so are

742
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,800
there any questions about that does that

743
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,919
make sense now right so this is really

744
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,679
yes

745
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,839
>> K is the GCD of everyone has this

746
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,280
>> uh you know I said that this is so this

747
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,639
is you know even though this is just

748
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,560
three lines it's a bit subtle right so

749
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,480
here what I said was that if you give me

750
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,839
any integer k that divides both a and b

751
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,720
it also divides B minus A. So in

752
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,839
particular now when I set K to actually

753
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,800
be whatever the GCD is

754
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,919
then I know that that same K had also

755
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,800
divi better divide B minus A. So it's a

756
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,280
candidate for the GCD of A and B minus

757
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,400
A. So even though this is just a couple

758
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,960
lines the logic is a bit subtle. Okay.

759
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,560
All right. So this proves one direction

760
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,359
but really we want to prove that these

761
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,119
two things are equal. So let's prove the

762
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:14,560
converse. So conversely

763
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:18,960
let's suppose that K divides A and

764
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:22,000
K divides B minus A.

765
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,599
Well then what I claim

766
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,680
is that K divides B. And that's the same

767
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,160
proof as before what happened here,

768
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,760
right? So if k divides a that means I

769
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:37,040
take a divided k get an integer. b minus

770
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,480
a divided k I get an integer and b is

771
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,720
just b minus a plus a. So that is the

772
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,359
sum of two integers when I divide by k.

773
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,839
So the statement is true. And now this

774
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,400
allows me to prove the inclusion the

775
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,160
other direction. Right? So what this

776
00:35:50,400 --> 00:36:00,640
implies is that the gcd

777
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:05,520
of uh a and b minus a is a lower bound

778
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:09,200
for the gcd of a and b. Why? Because

779
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,760
whatever this integer k is the largest

780
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,400
integer that divides both a and b minus

781
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,520
a. I just proved for you that that same

782
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,520
integer had better divide both a and b.

783
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,160
So it's the same logic as above, right?

784
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,680
All right. So this is one of the key

785
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,160
proofs for today. So again I will ask

786
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,079
are there any questions about this

787
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,320
proof?

788
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,920
Good.

789
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,200
Speak now or hold your peace until the

790
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,040
next office hours or something. Okay.

791
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,119
All right. So let's do a souped up

792
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,560
version of lema one because once we have

793
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,200
lema one and we understand this logic uh

794
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,320
we're off to the races.

795
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,839
So [clears throat] now we'll be able to

796
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,640
get a lot of cool things immediately.

797
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,960
So you know lema one didn't make that

798
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,680
much progress at the in the grand scheme

799
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,599
of things because I started off with you

800
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,359
know two integers a and b and I made b a

801
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,839
little bit smaller because I turned b

802
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,800
into b minus a. That's not a huge amount

803
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,000
of progress, but you know, let's take a

804
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,880
leap instead of a step, right? What I

805
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,720
claim, same assumption. So B is at least

806
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:33,119
A. Then what I claim is that the GCD

807
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:34,960
of A and B is equal to the GCD of A and

808
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:41,320
the remainder

809
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,320
of taking B and dividing it by A.

810
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Okay, so now I made a huge leap. I'm not

811
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,280
just subtracting off, you know, one uh

812
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:56,320
multiple of a. I'm actually making, you

813
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,800
know, b way smaller potentially because

814
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,720
I'm dividing by a and just taking

815
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,680
keeping track of whatever the remainder

816
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,200
is. Does anyone have any intuition for

817
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,880
why this kind of statement should be

818
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,880
true? And my hint is the division

819
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,200
algorithm that's very conveniently right

820
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,200
above it.

821
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:29,119
Let me give you a hint. So let's say

822
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:30,640
that we write uh B as equal to Q * A + R

823
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,520
because that's what we get when we do

824
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,560
the division algorithm. And so what I'm

825
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,480
saying is that I can replace

826
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:44,079
B with R. Right? So what I'm doing

827
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,040
really is I'm not subtracting off one

828
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,440
copy of A, but I'm doing something a bit

829
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,839
more aggressive. So does anyone have any

830
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:57,480
hints about how this proof ought to go?

831
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,480
How should I do it?

832
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Yes.

833
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,000
>> Repeatedly used.

834
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,280
>> Perfect. That's exactly right. So it's

835
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,560
just a repeated application of lema one.

836
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,720
Perfect. So by the division algorithm

837
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,040
which is conveniently

838
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,040
right above.

839
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:24,640
Well, what I can do is that the GCD

840
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:28,560
of A and B is equal to the GCD

841
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:34,320
of A and B minus A, which is equal to

842
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:38,880
the GCD of A and B minus 2 A all the way

843
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:43,200
down to it's equal to the GCD of A and B

844
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,680
minus Q A which is of course the same

845
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,000
thing as R the remainder.

846
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,000
So it's just a repeated application. So

847
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,880
why do I keep subtracting off one

848
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,359
multiple of a per time? Instead I can

849
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,800
just jump to the end and do division,

850
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,680
right? And now I make a huge amount of

851
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,359
progress, right?

852
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,119
Because you know we won't prove the

853
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,000
progress bound, but it's very easy to

854
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,640
prove. Um, you know, the point is that

855
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,960
if A and B are like really close to each

856
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,720
other as integers, then I'm going to

857
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,520
make, you know, a huge amount of

858
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,280
progress in one of my two steps. If A

859
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,040
and B are very far from each other, all

860
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,839
of a sudden, the larger of the integers

861
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,359
goes down to being as small as a. So

862
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,560
either way, what ends up happening is

863
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,440
you get this gigantic speed up in the

864
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,800
algorithm. But you know let's think

865
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,280
about uh just a numerical example to see

866
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,680
what this algorithm looks like. And this

867
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,920
numerical example you know is really

868
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,359
just the uklidian algorithm in in

869
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,160
action. So you know

870
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,640
so the ukitian algorithm

871
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:56,720
works as follows.

872
00:40:50,640 --> 00:41:00,319
Um all you do is the GCD of AB

873
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:05,760
is equal to the GCD

874
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:08,560
of uh A and B1

875
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,119
where you know B1 is equal to the

876
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,640
remainder

877
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,920
of B and A

878
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:22,960
and then this is equal to the GCD

879
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:27,119
of A1 B1 1 where a1 is equal to the

880
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:31,119
remainder of taking a

881
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,200
and dividing by b1. So we just alternate

882
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,760
back and forth. We divide one of the

883
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,079
things by the other. Take the remainder

884
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,480
and now we take the smaller of the two

885
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,560
which now in this case you know is b1

886
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,599
and we take a divided by b1. And that

887
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,760
gives us our new a1. So we just keep

888
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,480
alternating back and forth until the

889
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,880
end. Okay,

890
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,440
so let's actually see a numerical

891
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,319
example of this just to make sure that

892
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,280
we're on the same page.

893
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,280
So, you know, in action, let's do it for

894
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,280
some

895
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:14,800
large uh integers. So, we could look at

896
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:17,200
something like the GCD of 46 and 360.

897
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,480
kind of hard to do in your head, but um

898
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,480
you know if I were to do out the

899
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,520
division algorithm,

900
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,839
well the first step is to take 360 and

901
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,560
divide it by 46,

902
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,359
right? And what I'll get the remainder

903
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,359
is going to be 38.

904
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,440
So I replace B with its remainder when

905
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,160
it's divided by A. And now I just divide

906
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,640
things the other direction. So if I take

907
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,960
36 of 46 / 38, I'm going to have 8 left

908
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,200
over. So I'll get that this is equal to

909
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,880
the GCD of 8 and 38.

910
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,119
And then I'll divide things the other

911
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,960
direction. I'll get the GCD of 8 and six

912
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,000
because I'll have six left over when I

913
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,440
take 38 and divide it by eight.

914
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,319
And then I'll take the GCD again and

915
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:15,920
I'll get two and six. And now I get uh

916
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,839
no remainder. The GCD between two and

917
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,240
zero.

918
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,680
So my uklidian algorithm stopped. But

919
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,319
what's my answer? Two. That's exactly

920
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,720
right. Because the key point is that

921
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:33,760
what lema one lema 2 tells us is that in

922
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,680
each step we're not changing the gcd.

923
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,359
And what is the greatest common divisor

924
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,000
between two and zero? It's just two.

925
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,240
because zero gets divided by everything

926
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,839
perfectly fine.

927
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,960
Okay,

928
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,240
so that's the ukitian algorithm which we

929
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,560
now understand.

930
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,240
And what I claim is that it's actually

931
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,119
going to help us answer that key

932
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,359
question. It's not totally obvious why

933
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,839
it does and what it has to do with it.

934
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,640
The key is really taking this algorithm

935
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,880
and doing more bookkeeping

936
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,880
and that's called the extended uklidian

937
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,880
algorithm.

938
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,560
So, you know, the key point behind this

939
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,560
algorithm is we're going to keep track

940
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,040
of how we got here.

941
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:44,400
So, for example, when I start off with

942
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,480
the state 46 360, right? Because I want

943
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,000
to compute the GCD between these two

944
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,440
things.

945
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,680
Instead of just replacing 360 with its

946
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,760
remainder, I'm actually going to keep

947
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,800
track of, you know, what integer

948
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,599
multiple of 46 I subtracted off to get

949
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,359
the remainder. So that's the key point

950
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,400
is that my next state in this

951
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,640
transition, 46 stays the same, but

952
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,200
instead of just having 38, I'm going to

953
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:15,839
keep track of it as 360

954
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,640
minus 7 * 46.

955
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,400
Okay.

956
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,440
Why am I doing that? We'll get into that

957
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,400
in a second. Uh but now same thing

958
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,200
happens here, right? So when I had, you

959
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,359
know, this number which is 38 and I knew

960
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,480
that I had to subtract off one copy of

961
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,920
it from 46 to get my remainder 8, right?

962
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,160
So I'm just going to subtract it off

963
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,880
wholesale, subtract off, you know, this

964
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:45,520
entire expression. And what this will

965
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,520
give me is it'll give me 46 minus

966
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,920
360

967
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:54,480
minus 7 * 46.

968
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,640
Right? And then on the other side I

969
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,280
still have 360us

970
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,599
7 * 46.

971
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,520
So this seems kind of strange because I

972
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,480
just took a beautiful algorithm that's

973
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,400
very simple to understand and analyze

974
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,079
and I just made it a lot uglier by

975
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,480
keeping track of all of these things.

976
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,680
Right? But the key point is if you look

977
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:21,200
in these steps the intermediates that I

978
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,920
have are all integer linear combinations

979
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,359
of the two things I started off with.

980
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,319
Originally I have 46 and 360 and all of

981
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,560
the numbers that I get in between are

982
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,760
some kind of integer times one of the

983
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,800
numbers 46 plus an integer times the

984
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,319
other number 360. So, at the end of the

985
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,480
day, when I get the answer of two, what

986
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,359
I've really done is when I keep track of

987
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:52,960
these integers along the way, I found

988
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:57,839
some integers s and t so that 46 * s

989
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:59,599
plus 360 * t is equal to two.

990
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,359
And my extended uklidian algorithm

991
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,960
window will not just compute that the

992
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:09,280
gcd is two but it'll find the integers s

993
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,960
and t that make that be true right and

994
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,119
so what's really cool about this

995
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:18,160
expression if you think about it right

996
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,079
let's say you didn't trust me you know

997
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,560
maybe I'm certainly prone to making

998
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,640
algebra mistakes like everyone else

999
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,359
maybe I made some algebra mistake along

1000
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,319
the way here and I just tell you the

1001
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:33,040
answer that I got two. One thing you can

1002
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:35,520
do is you can check that two actually is

1003
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,280
a divisor of the two things I started

1004
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,680
with. Right? So if I have, you know, two

1005
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,480
as my uh candidate answer, I can check

1006
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,079
that it really does divide both 46 and

1007
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,920
360.

1008
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,680
But how do I guarantee you that there's

1009
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,440
not a bigger divisor of both of them?

1010
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,599
Right?

1011
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,560
And so the key point is right here.

1012
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:02,079
Imagine there were a larger integer that

1013
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,880
divided both of them. You know, four,

1014
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,119
six, something like that, right? Imagine

1015
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,720
I had some integer k that was larger

1016
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,359
than two that divided both 46 and 360.

1017
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,720
I claim this expression proves for me

1018
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:19,200
that it cannot be a divisor of both.

1019
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,480
Because if K really did divide both of

1020
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,119
these things, 46 and 360, when I take

1021
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,839
the left hand side and divide it by K,

1022
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,240
I'd get an integer time an integer plus

1023
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,960
an integer time an integer. That's an

1024
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,680
integer. But my right hand side is not

1025
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,160
an integer. So this is actually a

1026
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,480
certificate that your answer cannot be

1027
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,319
any smaller. So you don't even have to

1028
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,440
trust my work because at the end of the

1029
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:48,640
day the S and the T I find are the proof

1030
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,520
that I found the largest possible GCD.

1031
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,040
Does everyone understand that?

1032
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,599
Okay.

1033
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,400
So now let's connect it back to our key

1034
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,359
question. Right? And I'll just state

1035
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,359
this as a lema first.

1036
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,680
This is really the thing which came out

1037
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:08,720
of our proof

1038
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,640
is that you know given

1039
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:15,599
any integers a and b

1040
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,359
what I claim is there exist integers s

1041
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,920
and t

1042
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:24,240
with the property that sa plus tb is

1043
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,440
equal to the gcd

1044
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,280
of a and b. And that's just the abstract

1045
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,680
version of what we just did in this

1046
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,160
specific example.

1047
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,640
But now we're in good shape to answer

1048
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,800
this question, right?

1049
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,960
So, you know, let's return to this,

1050
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,559
right? And let's ask, you know, why

1051
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,720
does

1052
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,839
four have

1053
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,839
a multiplicative inverse

1054
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,200
mod 7? Okay.

1055
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,000
Well, let's think about it in the

1056
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:08,720
context of the uklidian algorithm. So

1057
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:14,960
the GCD between four and seven is what?

1058
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:18,240
One, right? Because seven is prime.

1059
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,160
Now I can use this lema. You know if the

1060
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:26,680
GCD between four and seven is one, what

1061
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,680
it means by lema 3

1062
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:38,559
is that there are integers s and t so

1063
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:40,960
that 4 s + 7t is equal to 1.

1064
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:44,640
Okay.

1065
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,680
And what I claim is that this implies

1066
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,240
that four has a multiplicative inverse.

1067
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,640
You know we know the answer is two. But

1068
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,040
from this expression,

1069
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,240
what I claim is that my multiplicative

1070
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,480
inverse of 4 is s.

1071
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:07,200
When I take 4 * s, I'm going to get 1 -

1072
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:11,040
7t. So it's actually 4 * s is congruent

1073
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,559
to 1 modulo 7 because all of those

1074
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,119
integer multiples of seven go away.

1075
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,680
So that's actually the proof of why not

1076
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,440
just four has a multiplicative inverse

1077
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,400
mod 7. Why does every number that's non

1078
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,800
zero have a multiplicative inverse mod 7

1079
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:33,040
is just because for any other number B

1080
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:36,079
here I know the GCD between B and 7 is 1

1081
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:39,680
because 7 is prime and I know that means

1082
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:44,319
there's an expression 4 B uh sorry B S

1083
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,880
plus 7T = 1 and in that case S would be

1084
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:50,079
my multiplicative inverse right so even

1085
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,520
more generally the GCD between B and 7

1086
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:56,640
is one This is true for any nonzero B.

1087
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:02,720
And this would then imply by lema 3 that

1088
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:06,480
b * s + 7t = 1. And that means that uh

1089
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:09,720
you know this expression right here s is

1090
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,720
b inverse.

1091
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,760
Okay.

1092
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,960
So this actually answers all of our

1093
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,000
questions, right? So we had this

1094
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,960
question. Does every element have a

1095
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,720
multiplicative inverse? That's true as

1096
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,040
long as the modulus is prime. Right? I

1097
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,960
had this question. How could I compute

1098
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,000
the multiplicative inverse? So if I gave

1099
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:37,200
you some large prime P and I gave you

1100
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,760
some nonzero element A, how would I

1101
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:45,400
compute the inverse of A mod P? Does

1102
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,400
anyone have any ideas?

1103
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,000
The answer is on the board. some place.

1104
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,119
>> Yeah,

1105
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,760
>> you can use the

1106
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,000
>> perfect that's right. So I would use the

1107
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,319
extended uklidian algorithm. I would

1108
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,160
apply it with not 46 and 360 but a and p

1109
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,319
and I already you know my point of doing

1110
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,599
this isn't to compute the gcd. I know

1111
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:16,319
the gcd is one. My point is to find this

1112
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,640
expression the S and the T and then that

1113
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:21,760
S that I find will be the multiplicative

1114
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,440
inverse. That's exactly right. So this

1115
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:28,079
answers you know basically all the

1116
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:30,559
questions we could uh want right

1117
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,280
um in fact there's even a more subtle

1118
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,640
question which we can answer too.

1119
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:41,119
um you know if I have a uh modulus

1120
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:43,680
that's not prime like you know six it

1121
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:47,119
turns out that five has a multiplicative

1122
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,000
inverse mod 6 because the gcd of five

1123
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,599
and six is one so you'll actually have a

1124
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,240
multiplicative inverse you know when you

1125
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,079
don't have a prime modulus just for the

1126
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,079
things that don't share a common factor

1127
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,839
Okay, so this was the main part of

1128
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,160
lecture.

1129
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:14,800
But uh now what we're going to do is

1130
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,200
we're going to do one last

1131
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,960
cool application of modular arithmetic

1132
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,040
in the last you know few minutes of

1133
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,040
class.

1134
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,640
And this is another really important

1135
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,480
topic.

1136
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,640
uh tons and tons of applications. So

1137
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,880
I'll tell you you know the math riddle

1138
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:38,520
and then I'll tell you some applications

1139
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,520
of this uh you know once we solve it.

1140
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:49,640
So let's just start off with a riddle

1141
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,640
about modular arithmetic.

1142
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,079
So, let's say we've got a treasure chest

1143
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,720
and it's got gold coins.

1144
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:23,200
And let's imagine I promise you that if

1145
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:26,839
this treasure is divided into

1146
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,839
groups of five,

1147
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:34,680
I'm going to have four coins

1148
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,680
left over.

1149
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:42,720
And let's imagine same thing if it's

1150
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:45,520
divided up into groups of

1151
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:49,960
seven. What I'll have is I'll have one

1152
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,960
coin left over.

1153
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,680
So there are many possible answers to

1154
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,359
how many gold coins there could be, but

1155
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:02,240
what I'll be interested in is what's the

1156
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:05,240
smallest number. So what is the smallest

1157
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,240
number

1158
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,040
of possible coins?

1159
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,680
So that's our key riddle for the rest of

1160
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,520
lecture.

1161
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,280
Of course, this riddle is going to lead

1162
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,720
to, you know, a very interesting

1163
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,240
statement in its own right that's

1164
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,240
powerful.

1165
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,240
Um,

1166
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,559
and what I claim, you know, what's

1167
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:40,119
really going on here is that we have a

1168
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,119
system of equations.

1169
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,520
But the key point which is different

1170
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,720
than like the system of equations you've

1171
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,599
seen you know before is that these

1172
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,720
system of equations are really in

1173
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,359
modular arithmetic right so you know

1174
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,359
translating this

1175
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,640
so whatever we we want to solve for n

1176
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,960
which is the smallest number of coins

1177
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:14,000
that could be the answer. So we know

1178
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,599
that n is congruent to four mod 5.

1179
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
That's literally just using the

1180
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,000
definition, right? Because you know what

1181
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,280
that means is just that four is the

1182
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
remainder when we divide n by five.

1183
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:30,799
And the second statement is that uh you

1184
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:33,280
know n is congruent to one mod

1185
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:35,599
7.

1186
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,520
So it turns out that we can guess the

1187
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,319
answer here. But I'll tell you more

1188
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,319
formulaically how to find it. So if you

1189
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:46,400
take for example 29 then this works. You

1190
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:51,240
know it solves the system of two

1191
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,240
equations in different moduli.

1192
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,400
Um but actually there's a much more

1193
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,359
general result. I guess today is the day

1194
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,520
we're doing ancient results. So this

1195
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,079
similarly like the uklidian algorithm is

1196
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,880
you know one of the oldest algorithms.

1197
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:10,160
Um this is a fairly old uh statement

1198
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:15,480
too. It's uh due to a Chinese

1199
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,480
mathematician son Zushwan

1200
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,000
in the 4th century

1201
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:35,720
and what I claim and we'll prove this.

1202
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:35,720
So suppose a and b are relatively prime.

1203
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,640
By that I mean you know they don't both

1204
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,760
have to be prime but they share no

1205
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,240
common factors besides one. Their gcd is

1206
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,559
one between them. So imagine that a and

1207
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,160
b are relatively prime. You know a and b

1208
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,455
will play the role of five and seven

1209
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,119
here.

1210
00:58:52,455 --> 00:58:56,319
>> [clears throat]

1211
00:58:53,119 --> 00:59:00,440
>> So just to be clear, this means gcd of a

1212
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:00,440
and b equals 1

1213
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,960
and

1214
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:09,680
we have

1215
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:12,640
some unknown n that's between zero and

1216
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,559
ab minus one.

1217
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,359
Then what I claim is that if we think

1218
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:21,760
about the system of equations, n is

1219
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:27,440
congruent to r mod

1220
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:34,240
and n is congruent to s mod

1221
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:38,280
b. Then what I claim is that there is

1222
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,280
exactly one solution.

1223
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,240
So this is somehow exactly what you

1224
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,960
could hope for, right?

1225
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:52,240
You know, I'm only telling you one out

1226
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,079
of a possibilities here, right? I'm only

1227
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,920
telling you one out of b possibilities

1228
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,160
here.

1229
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,839
So at most I can uniquely determine

1230
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:04,240
integers between zero and ab minus one.

1231
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:07,119
But I'm claiming that every such integer

1232
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:12,640
is, you know, uniquely determined by its

1233
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:15,760
pair of residues modulo a and b.

1234
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,839
So really this is a bjection between all

1235
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,880
of these AB possibilities of the

1236
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:24,799
integers here and the possible pairs R

1237
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,079
and S of what this modulus moduli are.

1238
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,319
So are there any questions about the

1239
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,280
statements?

1240
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:34,799
All right. So let's prove this. Uh the

1241
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:38,240
proof of this is clever.

1242
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:41,440
Um usually this is called

1243
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,807
the Chinese remainder theorem.

1244
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,827
uh

1245
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,827
[clears throat]

1246
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,720
and let's prove this fact. This will use

1247
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,240
a lot of the properties about the

1248
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,640
uklitian algorithm and modular

1249
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,119
arithmetic that we've been developing

1250
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,119
for today's lecture. And then if we have

1251
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,799
time left over, I'll tell you a cool

1252
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,960
application

1253
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,960
uh just to get you know some intuition

1254
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,839
for why this Chinese remainder theorem

1255
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,839
is so powerful.

1256
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,839
Actually,

1257
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,119
I guess I could have kept that. All

1258
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,920
right.

1259
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,920
So, let's prove this.

1260
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,680
So you know as I told you already there

1261
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:31,640
are

1262
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,640
AB choices

1263
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:40,280
for N

1264
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,280
and similarly AB choices

1265
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:46,799
for the pairs ST.

1266
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:51,280
Right?

1267
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:54,559
So you know what we want to show

1268
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:57,680
is the following that for I'm going to

1269
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:01,040
call this statement star. I want to show

1270
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:06,480
that for any

1271
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:12,160
uh choices of x and y that are between

1272
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:15,960
zero and ab. So any possible answers xy.

1273
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,960
Well, what I want

1274
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,799
is that their pair of remainders are not

1275
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:27,760
both the same. I take the remainder of x

1276
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:31,359
/ a. I look at the remainder of x / b.

1277
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:34,720
That pair of remainders had better not

1278
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:38,319
both be equal to the pair of remainders

1279
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:41,440
I get when I take y and divide it by a.

1280
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:45,440
And similarly I take y and divide it by

1281
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,680
b. Okay. So maybe I have pairs xy that

1282
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,240
are different. I'll assume you know x

1283
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,799
not equal to y.

1284
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,440
Maybe I have pairs xy that are different

1285
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:58,559
that have one of their remainders match.

1286
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,559
But I cannot get different x's and y's

1287
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:06,359
which have both of their remainders

1288
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:06,359
match. So that's the key property. Okay.

1289
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,440
So let's show this. Um so we're going to

1290
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,440
show star

1291
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,640
by assuming it's not true

1292
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,039
and creating a contradiction.

1293
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,160
So this proof will be short but the

1294
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:33,200
logic is pretty clever for this.

1295
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,319
So you know let's assume that we have a

1296
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:40,079
pair XY that are different that are

1297
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:42,559
between zero and AB which have both of

1298
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,480
their pairs of remainders exactly

1299
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,559
identical and let's produce a

1300
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,400
contradiction.

1301
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:53,200
So you know if we have such a pair XY

1302
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:59,119
then what I claim

1303
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:00,960
is that uh you know X minus Y

1304
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:05,119
uh wait which way do I want to say this?

1305
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:08,119
Oh sorry other way around a divides X -

1306
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,119
Y.

1307
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:18,160
Uh why is that true?

1308
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:22,480
So we're assuming that this statement is

1309
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:26,359
false. Why is it true that uh a divides

1310
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,359
x minus y?

1311
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,359
What does it mean for these two things

1312
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,839
to be equal? Definitely their first

1313
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:41,200
components have to be equal.

1314
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:45,119
So if remainder of x / a is equal to the

1315
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:48,400
remainder of y / a then that means that

1316
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:50,960
they differ by an integer multiple of a.

1317
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,559
So a divides their difference. Right?

1318
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,960
This is the same type of thing we did

1319
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:58,480
before. And similarly we know that b

1320
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:04,200
divides

1321
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,200
x minus y as well. Right?

1322
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:11,200
And now here's the key, you know, idea.

1323
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:14,720
We somehow have to use the fact that A

1324
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:18,559
and B are relatively prime.

1325
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:22,720
We know by assumption that the GCD of A

1326
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:26,839
and B is equal to one.

1327
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,839
And what this tells us

1328
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:36,720
it means that AB

1329
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:38,480
the pair of them divides x - y.

1330
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:41,280
So this is the key thing. This isn't

1331
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:44,319
always true. You know if I had two

1332
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:48,960
things I had like um

1333
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:51,520
I don't know uh six and nine. If I knew

1334
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,880
that six divided my integer and nine

1335
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:58,160
divided my integer, it would not imply

1336
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,240
that 54 divides my integer because maybe

1337
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,039
I only have two powers of three sitting

1338
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:05,839
in there. But the key point is that

1339
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:08,720
because both a and b are relatively

1340
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:12,960
prime, the only way that they both

1341
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:15,839
divide xus y is if their product divides

1342
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,839
xus y as well. So you can think about

1343
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:19,680
this in the case where like a and b are

1344
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,760
not just relatively prime but they're

1345
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,400
prime. Like our in our example with five

1346
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,559
and seven. If five divides your integer

1347
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,520
and seven divides your integer, there's

1348
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,160
no choice. 35 has to divide your integer

1349
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,559
too. That's basically what the statement

1350
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,200
is saying, right? And this is the key

1351
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,960
step because now we're in good shape,

1352
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:43,520
right?

1353
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:47,720
And so you know if AB divides X - Y I

1354
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,720
claim this is a contradiction.

1355
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,680
So someone make me happy tell me what

1356
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,280
the statement contradicts. See the the

1357
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,680
you know the statements I've made are

1358
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,880
not very complicated but the logic is

1359
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:10,000
subtle. Right? I wanted to prove that

1360
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,960
star was true. So I assumed it's not

1361
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,280
true. I assumed that there was a

1362
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,760
different pair xy

1363
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:21,920
where uh there were both between zero

1364
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,520
and a minus and ab um where a divides

1365
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,720
their difference and b divides their

1366
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:29,200
difference. And I concluded that ab must

1367
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,280
divide their difference. But now I claim

1368
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,039
I'm done and I've actually contradicted

1369
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,440
something.

1370
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,599
Um, if X and Y are different, then they

1371
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,880
will then they have to be off by at

1372
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,839
least AB.

1373
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,119
>> That's exactly right. That's right. If X

1374
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:48,960
and Y are different and are between zero

1375
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:51,920
and AB, they cannot differ by a multiple

1376
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,680
of AB. That's impossible.

1377
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,799
It's the same type of logic we used

1378
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:59,280
earlier. So this contradicts what we

1379
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,000
started off with. And what this means is

1380
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:05,520
that you know hence the Chinese

1381
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,280
remainder theorem is true.

1382
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:13,799
So very very clever proof.

1383
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,799
Okay, make sense.

1384
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,239
And if you have any questions about

1385
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,920
these things, you should sit down and

1386
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:22,719
make sure that you can reconstruct the

1387
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,319
logic yourself. You know, this proof and

1388
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:28,400
the proof of lema one are not hard, but

1389
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,560
really, you know, one of the things of

1390
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:33,440
doing proofbased math is it's one thing

1391
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:36,640
to be able to verify line by line the

1392
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,759
steps as someone is giving them to you,

1393
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,480
but to really understand, you know, it

1394
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:44,239
in, you know, uh, deeply, you have to

1395
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,480
check whether or not you can reconstruct

1396
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,400
these things yourself. You know, these

1397
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,480
types of things often happen on tests

1398
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,679
where you think that you understood

1399
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,920
something, but when you're forced to

1400
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,359
come up with it yourself, it's much

1401
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,679
harder. So that's just a piece of

1402
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,679
advice. Yeah.

1403
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,640
>> Okay. So the solution exists at all. Um

1404
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,679
so the point is that uh you know every

1405
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,319
pair that's a good question, right? So

1406
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:14,480
we know that uh you know there are n

1407
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:17,600
there are ab choices for n and there are

1408
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:21,679
ab choices for st.

1409
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:24,799
Now if every choice of n gets mapped to

1410
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:28,480
some choice of st right and what we just

1411
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:30,560
proved is that they don't collide ever.

1412
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,120
So what this really means is that we can

1413
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,600
draw this bipartite graph right here

1414
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,679
where these are all of the values of n.

1415
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:41,520
These are all the different possible

1416
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:44,400
pairs st and every n gets mapped to some

1417
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:47,440
value st just by taking the remainder

1418
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:50,640
modulo a and modulo b. And so what this

1419
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:54,080
proof just showed is that there are no x

1420
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,920
and y that map to the same thing. If

1421
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,320
there are no X and Y that map to the

1422
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,400
same thing and they're the same size,

1423
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,880
there's no choice, but everything maps

1424
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,120
to exactly one thing and that means

1425
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,000
everything has a solution and we can go

1426
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,159
back and forth. Good. Very good

1427
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,520
question. There's also another way to

1428
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,280
answer your question which is the way

1429
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,560
that I will do next. So, thanks for the

1430
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,480
segue. Uh that'll be our last math topic

1431
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,320
for today before I tell you an

1432
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,480
application.

1433
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:27,360
Um, see the same way like you know it

1434
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,760
was one thing to ask this question about

1435
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,719
whether or not every integer has a

1436
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,120
multiplicative inverse modulo prime and

1437
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,840
then we asked for more because we not

1438
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,440
only wanted that the answer was yes. We

1439
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,400
wanted to actually find what that

1440
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:45,120
multiplicative inverse is. Right? And

1441
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,199
you know the even stronger thing we

1442
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,080
could ask for is okay the Chinese

1443
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:52,400
remainder theorem is true. Hooray. But

1444
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:55,520
maybe we can also ask whether we can

1445
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:59,120
find the solution.

1446
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:04,800
So how can we actually find n? In our

1447
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:09,600
case, n was you know 29. So how can we

1448
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:11,920
find n, right? And so here's you know

1449
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,600
the stepbystep procedure for how we

1450
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:18,560
would do it. So first thing

1451
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:26,000
is that we write

1452
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:29,440
n is equal to k b + t right so this is

1453
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,760
just the statement that if I take n and

1454
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:36,800
divide it by b the leftover will be t

1455
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,719
and I don't know what k is so this just

1456
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,320
captures you know one of my modular

1457
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:45,760
equations the second one right and we

1458
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:47,440
know that

1459
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,640
A

1460
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:53,440
is going to be between zero and A just

1461
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,480
because we know that our answer, you

1462
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:59,199
know, is supposed to be at most AB,

1463
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:02,480
right?

1464
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:04,880
And so what we can do

1465
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,719
is we can take this expression which is

1466
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:10,080
just an integer expression. There's no

1467
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:15,199
modulus here. And we can take the we can

1468
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:22,080
take mods on both sides. We know that um

1469
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:24,320
this implies that uh k b + t is

1470
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:28,400
congruent to s

1471
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:31,120
mod a. This was our first equation and

1472
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,600
now this was our second equation and

1473
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,679
these modular constraints right because

1474
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,560
this unknown integer n we know it should

1475
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:42,719
be equal to t mod b and same thing it

1476
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:45,280
should be equal to s mod a right and so

1477
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:49,120
what this implies now if we just

1478
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:54,320
rearrange things is that kb is equal to

1479
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:56,560
s minus t mod a. So, you know, just to

1480
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,400
emphasize, we know S and we know T

1481
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,880
because those are the constraints in our

1482
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:05,040
system of modular equations. And what

1483
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:07,199
we're looking for is what K is, right?

1484
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,000
So, now does anyone have any ideas how

1485
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:12,080
we might uh solve

1486
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,320
this equation to figure out what K is?

1487
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,800
So, what's the key idea? How can we

1488
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,800
solve this equation?

1489
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,800
Perfect. That's right. We can just

1490
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:28,800
multiply by the multiplicative inverse

1491
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:32,480
of B which why does it exist? Because

1492
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,560
the GCD of B and A is one by assumption.

1493
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,800
So we know from the extended uklidian

1494
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,600
algorithm that the multiplicative

1495
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,159
inverse exists and we can find it. So in

1496
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:46,159
particular we can solve this equation

1497
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:50,239
and we get that K is congruent to B

1498
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:54,320
inverse S minus T and this all happens

1499
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:57,120
mod A right

1500
01:13:54,320 --> 01:14:00,560
we know B inverse exists and because K

1501
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:02,960
is between zero and A well K is actually

1502
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,760
equal to its remainder so this just is

1503
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,480
the answer right here right so we can

1504
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:12,880
actually compute K using this assumption

1505
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:15,040
that uh you know k is between zero and

1506
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:18,560
a.

1507
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:22,000
So in the last four minutes I'm going to

1508
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:24,880
tell you a really cool application.

1509
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,320
Um this is somehow like a baby version I

1510
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:31,280
made up of like a more real application.

1511
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:35,239
Um

1512
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,239
but let me tell you about it.

1513
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:51,040
So, last time for my demo, I asked you

1514
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,320
guys, "What are embarrassing movies you

1515
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:56,239
like?" And I got, you know, much less

1516
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,880
exciting answers than I usually get. So,

1517
01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:01,040
you guys got to work on that. But, uh,

1518
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,040
how many people here stream stuff

1519
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,040
online?

1520
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,000
There are people who didn't put their

1521
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,120
hands up. [laughter]

1522
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,880
How many people stream stuff online?

1523
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,199
How many people stream stuff illegally

1524
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,920
online?

1525
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:20,320
Oh, I saw you. Okay. [laughter]

1526
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,000
Okay. So, let me tell you about a cool

1527
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,800
application which has to do with

1528
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,400
streaming, which is something related to

1529
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,840
fountain codes. Surely fountain codes

1530
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,800
are a whole topic in their own right.

1531
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:35,760
And this is a hugely simplified version,

1532
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:38,400
but imagine I've got some giant file n

1533
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:41,040
and I have not just uh you know I'm I'm

1534
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,280
representing the contents of the file as

1535
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:46,159
some gigantic integer. So this is a

1536
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,400
truly huge integer, right? Not one I'd

1537
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:51,280
want to compute its factorization for by

1538
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,199
hand or anything. But now I have not

1539
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,920
just one person but many people

1540
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:58,000
streaming, right? Maybe it just came out

1541
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,920
like a new season of Stranger Things or

1542
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,640
something and everyone's trying to

1543
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,480
stream the same same thing. And you

1544
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,440
know, one of the ways that you can

1545
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,040
reconstruct the file is imagine, you

1546
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,199
know, I'm just going to sit out there

1547
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,840
broadcasting a bunch of snippets of the

1548
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,840
message. So what my snippets are going

1549
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,920
to look like is it's going to look like

1550
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:22,080
some modulus

1551
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:27,920
um you know A1 and then I'll take the

1552
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:29,679
remainder of N divided by A1 and I'll do

1553
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,600
this for a whole different choice of

1554
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:34,400
these AI. So I'll choose a whole bunch

1555
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,480
of primes AI. I'll tell you what the

1556
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:39,679
prime is and then I'll tell you the

1557
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:43,360
modulus. you know what the file contents

1558
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:47,600
look like as a huge integer modulo uh

1559
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:51,400
a1. Okay, so you know how can you

1560
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,400
reconstruct the file?

1561
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:04,880
So once you have you've received some

1562
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:08,320
set of the uh messages these are what

1563
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:11,360
you've received

1564
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:13,600
as long as the product of the ais is

1565
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,520
larger than n. That's really the

1566
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,440
generalization of the Chinese remainder

1567
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,679
theorem where I just had two factors a

1568
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:22,800
and b. But as soon as I have the product

1569
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:25,840
of these ais is larger than n, then the

1570
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,360
same type of thing works and I can use

1571
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,400
the Chinese remainder theorem to

1572
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:31,600
reconstruct what n is. But now the

1573
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,520
really cool thing about it which

1574
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,080
explains like fountain codes is you have

1575
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,159
all these people streaming and you know

1576
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,000
maybe it's like a one gig file but

1577
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:42,400
they're all not streaming at the same

1578
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,719
time. So what you can do is you can just

1579
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,480
broadcast these messages perpetually.

1580
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:49,600
It's like a water fountain that's, you

1581
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:51,199
know, um, always spraying water and

1582
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,840
everyone comes there and as soon as they

1583
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:56,000
fill up their one gig of data, they can

1584
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,840
reconstruct the file, it doesn't

1585
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,239
actually matter which one gig of data

1586
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,400
they get. So these kinds of things are

1587
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:05,120
very effective ways of sending one thing

1588
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,880
to many parties. when those same

1589
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,040
parties, you know, are listening in and

1590
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,199
getting different uh snippets of the

1591
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,280
code, they'll still be able to recover

1592
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:16,080
it because they've all filled up their

1593
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,920
ngene bottle with the one gig. So, this

1594
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,520
is a very simplified version of what

1595
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,920
fountain codes are because really you

1596
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,320
care about things like errors in the

1597
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,760
messages, but you can already see why

1598
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,280
things like the Chinese remainder

1599
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,640
theorem and modular arithmetic are

1600
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,560
extremely powerful. So next time on

1601
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,280
Thursday, we're going to be starting uh

1602
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,719
group theory and we'll talk a little bit

1603
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,400
more about, you know, modular

1604
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,760
arithmetic, especially the parts we need

1605
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:44,760
for crypto. But uh see you all then. All

1606
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,760
right.
