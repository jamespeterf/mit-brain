1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,120
So today we're going to continue our

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
discussion of uh producer Theory

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,800
remember the first few lectures we

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,279
developed consumer Theory and where the

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,080
demain curve came from now we're turning

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,640
to producer Theory and where the supply

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,640
curve comes from drawing on a lot of

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,359
parallels from the math and techniques

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,279
that we use for Consumer Theory so we're

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,840
going to start today by talking about

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,520
the key construct a key construct of

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,079
producer Theory which is short run cost

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,280
curves remember the short run is the

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,960
period of time over which some inputs

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,719
are fixed in our case capital and other

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,680
inputs are variable in our case labor

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,239
okay so basically we last time developed

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,719
a firm production

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,960
function now I want to translate that

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,000
production function into costs and why

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,239
do we want to do that because remember

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,159
the way firms maximize profits is by

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,000
minimizing costs by producing Goods as

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,560
efficiently as possible at minimum costs

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,479
remember a production function from last

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,759
time was little Q equals the square root

27
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,799
of L * K

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
okay that was our production function

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,119
now what we want to do today is write

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,920
down a new function which is what does

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,240
it cost to produce little Q for any

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,640
given L and K what's it cost well the

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,840
cost of producing producing little Q

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,479
which is a function of Q is equal to the

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,720
amount of capital you have which is

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,759
fixed which is I'm sorry which is fixed

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,479
times the rental rate of capital

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,520
remember that's the price of machines is

39
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:50,600
their rental rate plus the amount of

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:54,320
Labor which is a function of Q times the

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,680
wage so basically your choice variable

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,159
is how many workers you want to have to

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,000
decide how much Q you want to produce

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,799
you're going to decide how many hours of

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,320
Labor or workers you want to employ by

46
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,520
the way I will talk

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,959
interchangeably between hours of Labor

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,680
and workers there's no right measure of

49
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,319
L it depends on the context Etc so don't

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
feel like it's just two different ways

51
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,480
of measuring the L input so uh it

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,959
matters less when I say hours of work

53
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,720
versus workers if it's an important

54
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,879
distinction I'll tell you but right now

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,840
I'm using two different ways of

56
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,879
measuring L the bottom line is it's a

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,640
labor

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:35,120
input okay so now

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,920
we want to um say what is the explicit

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,519
expression for the cost function well in

61
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,599
fact if we know a production function

62
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,879
and we know W and R we can write down a

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,440
cost function so we know this production

64
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:53,040
function and let's assume for this case

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,760
let's assume W equals 5 and R equals 10

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,920
okay where those come from I'll teach

67
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,519
you that in a few lectures remember we

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,560
sort of peeled the onion in this class

69
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,840
we're kind of revealing the m slowly

70
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,239
right now just take those as given in a

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,840
few lect I'll tell you where they come

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,360
from okay so we know the production

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,640
function is qal squ of L * K so we can

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,640
take that from that production function

75
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:21,280
we can just flip it and say Lal Q ^2

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,799
over K bar right just squaring that

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,360
moving to the other side okay so then we

78
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,959
could say that we can rewrite the cost

79
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:34,920
function as C equals 10 K

80
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:40,879
Bar okay because 10 is the rental

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,360
rate plus five q^2 over K Bar because

82
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,760
plug in from this equation five is the

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,360
wage

84
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,360
rate okay now K bar is a fixed number to

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,959
make life easy let's just assume K Bar

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,480
equals one it could be any fixed number

87
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,840
in the short run let's assume K bar is

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,560
one to make life easy so that says that

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,120
the cost function we could simply write

90
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,159
as 10 + 5

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,239
q^2 that's our cost function to get that

92
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,400
cost

93
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,400
function which is a relationship between

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,359
the cost of the firm and the quantity

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,959
they produce okay the cost function

96
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,000
relates the quantity produced to the

97
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,400
cost all we do is start with the

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,400
production function plug in these

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
parameters and we end up with a cost

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,520
function okay so that's how you

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
translate production to

102
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,680
cost okay

103
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,880
now let's look at this cost function for

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,360
a second and and I want to give you some

105
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
key definitions that we'll be using

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,120
throughout this

107
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,800
course okay we are going to

108
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,199
call fixed

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,440
costs fixed

110
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,759
costs are going to be costs which are

111
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,080
not variable in the short

112
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,680
run fixed costs are costs which are not

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,320
variable in the short run here it's 10

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,240
the fixed cost in this example is 10

115
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,600
there's nothing you can do in the short

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
run to change your fixed cost because

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,600
capital's

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,320
fixed variable

119
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,320
costs are the costs that can be varied

120
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,639
in the short run in our case variable

121
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,400
costs are 5

122
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,759
q^2 so your variable costs are 5 q^ squ

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
that's the part of cost that you can

124
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
move in the short

125
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,160
run and total costs is the sum of those

126
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,240
two as expressed there total cost is the

127
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,520
sum of fixed and variable

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,720
costs now the

129
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,880
key the the single key that will drive

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,240
production theory is what we're going to

131
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,039
call marginal costs marginal costs is

132
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,120
the

133
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,840
differential of total costs with respect

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,880
to

135
00:05:49,840 --> 00:06:00,919
quantity okay so marginal cost is DC

136
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,720
DQ which G given that fixed costs are

137
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,160
fixed in the short run it's the same as

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,039
saying D variable cost

139
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,680
DQ okay in the short run D total cost DQ

140
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,560
is the same as D variable cost DQ

141
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,400
because fixed costs are

142
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:21,479
fixed okay so marginal costs are the

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,599
marginal cost of producing the next unit

144
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,840
what is the cost to produ of the next

145
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,919
unit it's the change in variable costs

146
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,840
for the next unit

147
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,720
produced and then finally we'll Define

148
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
average cost is what they sound like

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,680
which is C over Q total cost over

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,160
quantity produced that's average

151
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,919
cost we can graph these various cost

152
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Curves in figure

153
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,919
61 so figure 61 in your handout shows

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,160
the cost curves for our sample cost

155
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,800
function which remember is really our

156
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,400
example production function given in RW

157
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,800
and K Bar what you see here is the

158
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,319
marginal

159
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,400
cost that is D variable cost DQ

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,720
is equal in our example to 10 Q just

161
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,680
differentiating that with respect to Q

162
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,080
is 10 Q our marginal costs are are the

163
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,440
line with the equation 10

164
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,240
Q our average

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,639
costs are this expression over Q so it's

166
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:30,800
10 over Q + 5

167
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:32,680
Q 10 over Q + 5 q is average cost

168
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,919
okay how did I get that it's divide the

169
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,199
cost by Q okay also on this graph you

170
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,639
can see average variable costs and

171
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,599
average fixed cost so you can see that

172
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,440
the average cost line is a combination

173
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,280
of two pieces an average variable cost

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,199
which is everywhere up sloping upward

175
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,720
sloping and average fixed cost which is

176
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:57,400
everywhere fall which is everywhere

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,080
falling okay so average costs themselves

178
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,240
first fall then rise

179
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,159
PR average cost First fall then rise why

180
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,720
is that well that's because at first you

181
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:10,720
have these big fixed costs you have to

182
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,560
sort of pay off but over time the fixed

183
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,199
cost gets small well the variable cost

184
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,319
so over time it

185
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,840
rises okay so average costs are the

186
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
first fall because the first couple

187
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,919
units your costs are very high your

188
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,159
costs are super high at the start

189
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,319
because you got all these fixed costs

190
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:29,159
each unit you those fixed costs per unit

191
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,039
fall and fall and fall that's the AFC

192
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,639
loan

193
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,800
fixed cost per unit fall and fall and

194
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,080
fall whereas Mar variable cost per unit

195
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,599
rise and rise and rise and the

196
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,320
minimum of average cost is where it

197
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,240
crosses the marginal cost curve it's

198
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,440
just mathematical the minimum if you

199
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,519
take a function the minimum of the

200
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,920
average is going to be where it

201
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,720
intersects the margin okay because

202
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,839
wherever the average cost is wherever

203
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,680
the marginal cost is above the average

204
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,120
cost the average cost is rising wherever

205
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,680
the marginal cost is below the average

206
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,040
cost that's falling therefore marginal

207
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,000
cost intersects average costs at the

208
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,240
minimum okay in other words if average

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,640
cost if you're to the point to the left

210
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,320
of

211
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,800
1.5 if you're Rising less than 1.5 units

212
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,839
marginal cost is below average

213
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,800
costs okay so by producing more you

214
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,320
drive average cost down because the

215
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
marginal cost is less than the average

216
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,160
cost so as you increase production from

217
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,079
one unit to one and a half unit you

218
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,560
drive average cost down but once

219
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,160
marginal cost is above average cost

220
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,720
increasing production drives average

221
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,839
cost up and that's why marginal cost

222
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,519
hits average cost at the

223
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,360
minimum okay questions about those

224
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,360
relationships are those

225
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,640
graphs okay so

226
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,680
now let's go back and note a key

227
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,600
relationship between marginal cost and

228
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
something we discussed last time the

229
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,240
marginal product of

230
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,600
labor okay remember

231
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:15,600
cost

232
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:18,600
equals uh K Bar * r+ L *

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,440
W if you differentiate this with respect

234
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,959
to Q to get the marginal cost you get

235
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,320
marginal

236
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:31,320
cost equals W * DL DQ okay because this

237
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,040
term drops out and so you just

238
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,600
differentiate differentiate by the law

239
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:41,040
of of you get W time dld

240
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:45,000
DQ okay so the marginal cost of

241
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,120
producing the next unit is the price per

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,639
unit of

243
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,560
Labor times how many units of Labor it

244
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,120
takes to make the next unit this is the

245
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,639
price per unit of Labor W this is how

246
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,320
much labor takes to make the next unit

247
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,639
so the marginal cost of the next unit is

248
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,720
the product of those

249
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,279
but we also know from last

250
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,519
lecture we know from last lecture that

251
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,040
DQ DL we had a name for that we called

252
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,560
that the marginal product of labor we

253
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,800
defined that last lecture how productive

254
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:22,360
the next unit of Labor is was

255
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,440
dql so we can substitute in to write we

256
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,519
can substitute that in to write that

257
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,240
marginal cost equals W over the marginal

258
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,240
product of labor

259
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,800
that is the marginal cost producing the

260
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,120
next unit of the good is higher the more

261
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,200
you have to pay each worker and lower

262
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,920
the more productive each worker

263
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,079
is okay so as marginal product of labor

264
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,639
is very high unless wages very high

265
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,480
marginal cost is going to be

266
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:55,560
low okay so basically what's going to

267
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,560
matter is the marginal uh the

268
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,519
marginal product of each unit of Labor

269
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,360
and the wage of to pay for that

270
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,839
unit okay now last point I want to make

271
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,560
here on on definitions I want about

272
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,480
something called sunk

273
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,639
costs I'm gonna I'm GNA already

274
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,600
contradict something I said last lecture

275
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,959
last lecture I said in the long run all

276
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,720
inputs are variable in the short run

277
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,079
only some inputs are variable we have

278
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,040
some costs which in the we have some

279
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:29,240
costs which in the long run are not

280
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,399
variable those are called sunk costs

281
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,440
those are costs where once you make them

282
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,000
you can never get them

283
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,440
back a fixed cost is something like a

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,760
machine if you buy a machine and you

285
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,399
want to get rid of it you can sell that

286
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,519
machine or a building if you buy a

287
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,040
building and you want rid of it you can

288
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,199
sell that building a sun cost is

289
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,800
something you can't ever get rid of or

290
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,760
sell the best example would be med

291
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,079
school if you want to be a doctor you

292
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,040
have to go to med

293
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,760
school having gone to med school school

294
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,480
you can't ever ungo to med school you

295
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,040
have paid that cost of time and money

296
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,120
and you're done it's

297
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,000
sunk a sunk cost is essentially a long

298
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,920
run fixed cost it's something where once

299
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,760
you make that investment you never get

300
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,160
it there's no way to get it back now you

301
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,920
can get benefits from it I'm not saying

302
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,360
it's not a good idea I'm just saying

303
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,160
unlike a building which you could sell

304
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,480
or a machine which you could sell med

305
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,839
school you can't sell your med school

306
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
experience okay and this is very

307
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,720
important important because it leads to

308
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,360
a very

309
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,040
counterintuitive difference between sunk

310
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,720
costs and fixed costs something that

311
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,959
trips people up all the

312
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,519
time which is that sunk costs are

313
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,519
irrelevant to decision making once

314
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,440
they're

315
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,680
paid once you've paid your sunk costs

316
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
they are relevant because you can't get

317
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,639
them back anyway it's done or does The

318
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,880
Economist say sunk costs or sunk doesn't

319
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,959
matter it's

320
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,800
irrelevant now here's why that matters

321
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,120
in real life

322
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,839
let me talk about a simple example many

323
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,720
of you have heard of the band Journey

324
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,199
classic 80s band a few years ago Journey

325
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,360
was touring and they have a new lead

326
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,160
singer this guy they fat actually

327
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,160
through YouTube who sounds he's from the

328
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,720
Philippines sounds just like the old

329
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,160
lead singer it's kind of cool so uh they

330
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,320
were playing down in uh uh Mansfield

331
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
Mass and I bought a couple of tickets

332
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,880
for my wife and I for 125 bucks each

333
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,079
good

334
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,279
seats then I looked at the set list and

335
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,639
I thought you know I don't actually like

336
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,800
that many Journey songs M there's hour

337
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,079
and a half concert for like the three

338
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,600
songs as I like it doesn't really seem

339
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,680
worth it I don't think I want to go I

340
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
think I'm going to try to sell these

341
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,079
tickets on the secondary market so I can

342
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,440
go to Stubhub and sell the tickets the

343
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,480
question

344
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,440
is I had paid $250 for those tickets how

345
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:50,680
should that impact the price I set on

346
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,759
StubHub the money I paid for those

347
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,839
tickets how should it that money forget

348
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,560
everything else just the money I paid

349
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,480
how should it impact the price I set on

350
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,759
StubHub

351
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,079
yeah it shouldn't why

352
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,000
not it's a some cost I paid it already

353
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,880
it's

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,759
irrelevant it's done I already paid the

355
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,920
250 it's gone I might feel sad but it's

356
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,279
gone how should I decide what to put the

357
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,040
tickets on salale for subhub well it's a

358
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,399
function of two factors first is I can

359
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,519
look at what things are selling for and

360
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,240
try to use the

361
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,199
market that's one thing but let's add no

362
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,399
information let's add no information on

363
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:30,319
the market leave that aside it's just an

364
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,440
internal decision decision on what what

365
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,440
I'm willing to sell the tickets for how

366
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
should I

367
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
decide

368
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,720
yeah you well that's one way to think

369
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,519
about it you'd not be a to pay the buy

370
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,040
tickets that's one way but there's sort

371
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,519
of a that's sort of a confusing way

372
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,480
there's another way to think about it

373
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,759
what's another way to think about it's

374
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
related to that sort the flip of what

375
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,480
you

376
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,480
said how should I think about how much

377
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm willing to I'm willing to how much

378
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,000
am I willing forget the price that I set

379
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,600
which is a function of what I think the

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,800
market is my willingness how much should

381
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,279
I you willing to sell those tickets

382
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:08,079
for well think about it if I if I sell

383
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,480
the tickets what am I not

384
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,600
doing I'm not going to the

385
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,199
concert so how much should I be willing

386
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,360
to sell the tickets

387
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:19,440
for yeah yeah go ahead white shirt you

388
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,000
had your hand up

389
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,480
yeah yeah basically I should sell them

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,160
for how much I'm willing to pay to go to

391
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,160
the

392
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,440
show if

393
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,720
literally I don't want to go that I

394
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,240
should be willing to sell them for zero

395
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,639
I should willing to give them away not

396
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,279
saying I will sell them for zero because

397
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,279
I might make money on it but there's a

398
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,720
my underlying opportunity cost at zero

399
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,720
because I literally would rather sit at

400
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,360
home if I say yeah I don't want to pay

401
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,120
250 but if you said you get Journey

402
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,600
tickets for 50 bucks each I'd go then I

403
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,399
should set the price at 50 bucks each if

404
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,440
someone will pay me more than 50 I sell

405
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,360
them if they'll pay me less than 50 I go

406
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,560
so the amount I should will be willing

407
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,560
to get should be determined by the

408
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,399
opportunity cost of going not by what I

409
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,520
paid for them that is a very confusing

410
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,120
logic

411
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,079
yeah but

412
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,120
some like

413
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,240
think you would because that's the way

414
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,839
humans think but it's

415
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,839
wrong it's not a real

416
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
thing but it doesn't matter they're

417
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:29,039
already gone so once again let me think

418
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,400
of it this way let's say that um you

419
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,880
the fact you've paid the costs makes you

420
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,400
sad you've you've paid those costs you

421
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,120
made them sad but right now if you

422
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,039
whatever you sell them for okay that's

423
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,440
all you can get back so let's say let me

424
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,240
put this way let's say I can go online

425
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,559
and sell them for 500 bucks each should

426
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,280
I only sell them for 250 because that's

427
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,160
what I paid for him no sell them for 500

428
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,480
so it's irrelevant that I paid 250 if I

429
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,360
only sell them for 50 I sell them for 50

430
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,600
I've sell them for 500 sell them for 500

431
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,760
what I paid is some amount I paid in the

432
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,679
past I may be sad about it and look let

433
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,039
me be clear the way you're thinking

434
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,120
about is the way that the world thinks

435
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,000
about it and it's wrong okay um you know

436
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,840
I got chastised by my advisor in

437
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,159
graduate school because I had plane

438
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,640
tickets that I was going to cancel and I

439
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,320
was suffering from the Sun cost Val I

440
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,320
was going to say well I paid this much

441
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,159
for him and he said doesn't matter what

442
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
you paid for him what matters is the

443
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,440
value to you of flying

444
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,520
home okay the sun costs are

445
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,520
gone okay

446
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:32,640
yeah s selling what

447
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,520
build oh so the difference that's a

448
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,240
great point the difference is um with

449
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,720
the

450
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,480
building when

451
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,600
I the difference is um with with the

452
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,280
building I buy it as an investment that

453
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,039
I intend to use for a while and then

454
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,280
sell with the tickets I just bought that

455
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,640
I wasn't thinking about selling them I

456
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,600
was thinking about buying them I mean

457
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,000
for example I could have bought the

458
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,799
Journey tickets as an investment like a

459
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,880
building I could have bought the Journey

460
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,200
tickets and said well look I'm going to

461
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,480
pay this for them because I at that form

462
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
I plan to sell them but I wasn't plan to

463
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,440
sell them I just bought them I thought I

464
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,400
was done then things changed so from my

465
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,039
new perspective they were

466
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,919
sunk It's a good question good questions

467
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,480
yeah some costs are basically Goods that

468
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,320
you didn't want to sell in the first

469
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,080
place some costs are things Investments

470
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,360
you

471
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,600
make you decide I want to go to med

472
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,600
school I want to go to Journey okay and

473
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,400
you make and you make those decisions

474
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,120
and then things change and you may or or

475
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,520
they don't change but the point is

476
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,159
whatever you want to do next it's

477
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,360
irrelevant that you made that decision

478
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,880
you already made it now the question is

479
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,440
what to do next it's it's it's it's not

480
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,159
it's not an easy concept but it's an

481
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,159
important one

482
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
yeah oh you use it and journey buy joury

483
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,080
tickets was the kind of investment that

484
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,360
I would have used to go to Journey the

485
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,159
difference if I decide I don't want to

486
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,760
be a

487
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,080
doctor let's say being a doctor is

488
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,559
composed to three things going to med

489
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,760
school buying an office and working

490
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,360
every day if I decide I want to be aor

491
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,960
doctor I can stop working every day I

492
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,360
can sell the office but I can't ungo to

493
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,000
med school it's

494
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,360
done so my decision tomorrow do I want

495
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,039
to stay being a doctor it's irrelevant

496
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,480
if I went to med school I just say well

497
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,320
how much do I like it how much money I'm

498
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,960
making Rel to the cost of the office and

499
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,559
the cost of what I have of my time and

500
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,360
working every

501
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,720
day

502
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,960
okay that these are great questions

503
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,559
because this is exactly kind of concept

504
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,640
that I want you to be able to think

505
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,280
differently about coming out of this

506
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,039
course yeah

507
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,640
or at least for some cost does intent

508
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,880
matter what's that intent matter well

509
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,400
it's it intent matters and whether we

510
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,679
label it fixed or sunk that was the

511
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,960
question here intent matters if you

512
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,400
intend to eventually use it and sell it

513
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,799
then it's fixed if you intend if it

514
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,880
can't be sold or you don't intend to

515
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,240
sell it then it's sunk but that that's a

516
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,640
fuzzy

517
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,039
line okay all right great discussion

518
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,360
let's go on so now let's talk talk about

519
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,360
the long run versus the short

520
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,840
run the long run versus the short

521
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,080
run the difference in the long run let's

522
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,159
put Sun cost aside now how many choose

523
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,440
let's put them aside okay that's more

524
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,360
just sort of a fun thing for you to be

525
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,799
thinking about in your life but for but

526
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,240
for the rest for most of us class we'll

527
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,080
talk about cost being fixed or variable

528
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,600
not sunk so let's go back to where we

529
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,159
just fixed and variable costs and we

530
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,039
want to ask how do costs differ in the

531
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,320
long run to short run and here there's a

532
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:38,760
relatively simple but important

533
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:42,440
intuition which is that long run

534
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,600
costs will always

535
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,440
be at the lower bound of short run

536
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,320
costs the cost of production in Long Run

537
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,760
are always the same or lower than the

538
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,400
cost of production in the short run to

539
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,120
see this let's go to figure 62 this is

540
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,320
sort of a hard intuition let's go figure

541
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,559
62 in this figure there's a firm that

542
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,279
has three possible scales of production

543
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,600
think of this is three different K bars

544
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,799
they can

545
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,159
choose and the way production work is in

546
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,640
the short run you choose a k

547
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,919
bar you then decide how much l to use

548
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,440
and that's what you produce but in the

549
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,799
long run you can change your K bar so

550
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,480
think of a firm who has three different

551
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,960
K bar options and those three different

552
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,559
K bar options give three different

553
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,559
average cost curves because you can see

554
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,240
if I change K bar from one to two my

555
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,400
average cost would change my average

556
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,080
cost would no longer

557
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:43,039
be uh would no longer be 10 over Q + 5 q

558
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:47,840
okay my average cost would be 20 over Q

559
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:49,480
+ 5 q okay if Kar changed so think of

560
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,840
these three curves as three different K

561
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,480
bars now the firm in the short run has

562
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,640
to choose which one it wants so for

563
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,880
example

564
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,240
sr1 that short run AC cost curve one

565
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,559
that would be the average cost curve

566
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,640
they choose if they think they're not

567
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,559
going to produce that much they think

568
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,120
they don't have much demand for their

569
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,080
good as opposed to src3 that's the cost

570
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
curve they choose they think there's

571
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,400
going to be a lot of production they

572
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
think there going be a lot of demand for

573
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,279
the good so think of this about how big

574
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,200
you build the plant if you think people

575
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,799
are going to want much of your good you

576
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,440
build a small plant think they're going

577
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,799
want want to want want a lot of your

578
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,240
good you build a big plant and sr2 is in

579
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,760
between okay so in other words if the

580
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:34,600
firm wants to produce the amount little

581
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,080
q1 the most efficient K Bar to choose is

582
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,799
the K Bar that yields

583
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,919
sr1 right if the firm wants to produce

584
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:46,600
little Q Q3 the most

585
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,679
efficient K Bar to choose is the K Bar

586
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,760
that yields

587
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,840
sr3 but in the long run no matter what

588
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,279
since it can reoptimize over K it can

589
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,080
always do better than the short run it

590
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:02,200
could do or at least no worse so if it

591
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:06,000
turns out that in the long run demand is

592
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,279
q1 and you chose src1 great the long run

593
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,679
cost is the same as a short run costs

594
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,919
but if by mistake you chose

595
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,840
sr3 you can do better in the long run by

596
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:17,960
reoptimizing your Capital it's just like

597
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,760
any general scientific rule the more

598
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,440
variables you have to toy with the more

599
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,039
you can optimize okay here you can toy

600
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,080
with two variables labor and capital so

601
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,720
you can do better in terms of minimizing

602
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,840
costs this is is not just a theoretical

603
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,799
concept let's talk about one of the most

604
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,840
important uh companies in America today

605
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,000
which is

606
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:41,200
Tesla when Tesla was founded in

607
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,360
2013 Elon Musk had to decide how large a

608
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,640
battery production plant to

609
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:50,120
build he built a plant which was the

610
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,120
size such that he would sell 20,000 cars

611
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:56,279
in 2017 he figured his demand be 20,000

612
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,679
cars in 2017 so he buil a plant let's

613
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:03,039
call src1 cuz he expect Ed Q little

614
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:07,399
1 what happened was he got Q Little

615
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:10,080
3 by 2017 there was a 200,000 200,000

616
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:12,080
person waiting list for Teslas because

617
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,520
they couldn't produce the batteries fast

618
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,520
enough so Elon Musk realized he'd built

619
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,360
too small a plant so he then has built

620
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,360
the largest electric battery plant in

621
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,559
the world in Nevada he's gone from src1

622
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,000
to

623
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:29,559
src3 this clant can produce 500,000 cars

624
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,159
a year

625
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:33,159
but what if people decide Elon Musk is

626
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,960
an idiot and they don't want to buy

627
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,559
Teslas anymore okay and all of a sudden

628
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,240
Tesla sales Fall well that one could be

629
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,840
too big and maybe next time he'll sell

630
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,080
that plant and build one in

631
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,960
between the point is he can always

632
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,559
reoptimize depending on how demand turns

633
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,000
out to be so you can always do better

634
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,880
Elon Musk did not produce most

635
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,720
efficiently in the short run so he built

636
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,200
a bigger plant will he now produce most

637
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,360
efficiently it depends when the demands

638
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,240
set up a Q3 or somewhere else

639
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,760
okay questions about

640
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,320
that so basically the point is in the

641
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,640
long run it's just like the short run

642
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,200
except you get to choose K bar which

643
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,320
means you take multiple shots at what

644
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,440
average but having chosen K Bar you're

645
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,799
back in the short run all you can do is

646
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,120
value the number of

647
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,440
workers okay so think of the long run is

648
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,720
a set of Short Run games in the each

649
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,039
short run you choose K Bar you produce

650
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,640
as efficiently as

651
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,000
possible okay if if you turns out you've

652
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
chosen the wrong K Bar you then choose a

653
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,320
different on the next period the next

654
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,520
long run

655
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:39,279
period

656
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,279
okay so now let's talk about long run

657
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,520
costs let's talk about how we think

658
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,880
about firm production decisions and

659
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,240
costs in a world where both labor and

660
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,360
capital is

661
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,000
variable okay so remember last time we

662
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,080
developed an ISO

663
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,880
Quant the isoquant was the choice of all

664
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,480
L and K that give the same same little

665
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,120
Q the choice of all L and K that give

666
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,279
the same little Q was the

667
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,200
isoquant and you could

668
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,880
choose um and basically the point was

669
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,799
along any given isoquant there are

670
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,159
different combinations of L and K that

671
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,840
can give you a little Q just like along

672
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,360
an ISO just along an indifference curve

673
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,720
there are many combinations of pizza and

674
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,320
cookies that make you equally happy so

675
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,679
the question is how do you decide which

676
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,640
combination to use well to do so

677
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,960
we create just like in consumer Theory

678
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,520
we solve the problem by creating a

679
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,240
budget constraint in producer Theory we

680
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,559
solve the problem by creating an ISO

681
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,240
cost

682
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,880
line the iso cost line which is

683
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,760
basically the firm's budget constraint

684
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,360
if you will isoc cost line is the line

685
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,440
which gives you the cost of Labor and

686
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,480
capital uh that help you choose which

687
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,720
combination you'd like to choose so I'm

688
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,039
not saying it well in words let's go to

689
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,240
the graphs okay here's some isocost

690
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:06,159
lines remember I assumed that the wage

691
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,640
was five and the renovated Capital was

692
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,840
10 okay so basically these lines are

693
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,200
combinations of capital and labor that

694
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,880
yield the same total level of costs the

695
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,880
combination of capital and labor that

696
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,760
yield the same total level of costs so

697
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,240
you see the $50 Isa cost says if you

698
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,720
want to spend $50 you could either have

699
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,720
10 units of Labor

700
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,919
and no Capital five units of capital and

701
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,480
no labor some combination in

702
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,279
between but if you want to spend

703
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,720
$150 you could then have 30 units of

704
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,760
Labor and no capital or 15 units of

705
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,679
capital no labor or some combination in

706
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,760
between so it's basically the

707
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,360
combination of capital and labor that

708
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,559
yield the same total

709
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,240
cost okay and what is the slope of the

710
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,320
isocost line well the slope is minus W

711
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,679
over

712
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,080
R minus the ratio of the price of Labor

713
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,279
to the price of

714
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,519
capital okay what does this say this

715
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:14,000
says that you have to give up half a

716
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,880
unit of capital to get a unit of Labor

717
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,480
it's back to opportunity costs for a

718
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,679
given total cost of production if you

719
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,200
want one more worker you're gonna have

720
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,039
to give up half a

721
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,640
machine okay for a given total cost of

722
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,880
Productions that's the slope of the

723
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,360
isocost line so then we say the firm to

724
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,320
minimize

725
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:41,760
costs will use the efficient

726
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,279
combination of Labor and capital to

727
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
produce any level of goods and how do we

728
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,480
get that we get that by the tangency

729
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,200
between the isoquant and the iso cost

730
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,279
the tangency between the iso Quant and

731
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,519
the iso cost gives us the efficient

732
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,320
combination of capital and labor for any

733
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,320
level of production little Q so so for

734
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,559
example going back keeping these isocost

735
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,120
lines and going back to our production

736
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:07,760
function and our therefore cost

737
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:11,600
function we can draw the

738
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,240
isoquant okay uh for production okay so

739
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,519
we start with the production function we

740
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,799
start with our production function qal

741
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:23,720
of L * K okay we know that the slope of

742
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:30,960
the isoquant the isoquant slope we

743
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:33,480
defined last time is minus MP L over

744
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,000
mpk MPL over

745
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,880
mpk so at the tangency we set these two

746
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,360
things

747
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,200
equal we set npl over mpk equal to W

748
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,080
over

749
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,760
r that is in the optimum with this

750
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,399
example okay you set these things equal

751
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,960
you you always set the slope of the

752
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:55,600
isocost line equal to slope of the

753
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,639
isoquant but in this example that is

754
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,720
such that you want to use half as much

755
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:07,080
Capital as labor you want to basically

756
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,799
use because basically if you look at um

757
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,320
MPL if you use our example we defined

758
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:16,039
last time set these equal says remember

759
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,880
from last time the MPL was minus L over

760
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,200
K here we're saying to equal to minus W

761
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,159
over R okay if you remember last time we

762
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,519
solved for the marginal the mrts I'm

763
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,880
sorry K Over

764
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:36,080
l k over

765
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:37,639
l k over l so minus k lus w Rus k l we

766
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,240
defined last time as the marginal rate

767
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:40,240
of technical

768
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,960
substitution okay which is generally

769
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:49,240
this formula but in our specific case

770
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,639
it's that minus WR is the price ratio

771
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,440
the the margin rate of technical

772
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:55,000
substitution is the slope of the

773
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,919
isoquant minus W over R is the slope of

774
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,279
the price ratio here in our example

775
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:05,120
example we know that equals minus a half

776
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:08,200
so in this example you want to set K L

777
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,960
equal to minus a half you want half as

778
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,559
much Capital as

779
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,880
labor okay why is that well same

780
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,559
intuitions with

781
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,919
consumers okay you can the market is

782
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,919
telling you it's going to cost half as

783
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,840
much to have a worker as a

784
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,840
machine your technology is telling you

785
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,120
okay that you are you're basically

786
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,399
indifferent that basically you at the

787
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,159
point you're at you are um you're

788
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,159
basically the tradeoff between workers

789
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:48,039
and machines is K Over l so you set

790
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,159
those equal and that gives you the rule

791
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:53,080
that you want to set in our particular

792
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,880
example K Over L equal to minus W over2

793
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,600
so let me review again a the isoquant

794
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,080
Curve comes from production function and

795
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,559
delivers the marginal rate of technical

796
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,120
substitution which is this step one okay

797
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,000
step two the iso cost has a slope of

798
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,720
this step three you set them equal so

799
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,720
you get minus K Over L which is what

800
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,440
this is equals minus a half which is

801
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,880
what that is so use capital and labor

802
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,639
until using half as much Capital as

803
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,399
labor and once again you can use the

804
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,039
same kind of examples we use for

805
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,559
Consumer Theory to show you why if you

806
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,000
weren't using half as much Capital as

807
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,240
labor you'd be getting it wrong should s

808
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
yourself at home remember last time we

809
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,559
had points on we had points where the

810
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,919
where the indifference curve wasn't

811
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,880
tangent to the budget constraint we show

812
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,159
why they were wrong you can do the same

813
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,080
thing here you can draw points where the

814
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:46,559
isoquant is not tangent to the isocost

815
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,919
and show you why that's inefficient why

816
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:52,080
it's inefficient

817
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:55,080
production okay now questions about

818
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,080
that

819
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,080
yeah oh that's a okay oh Jesus that's

820
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,360
that the uh let me make sure I I get the

821
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:08,240
uh get the inversion right it's

822
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:12,639
MPL over mpk sorry about that that's not

823
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,800
any better mpk MPL mpk thank you for

824
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,079
asking once again 70% of the class had

825
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,119
no idea what those were so you did a

826
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,119
good service yeah go

827
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,679
ahead for this example yes the general

828
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,720
formula is that the mrts equal to the

829
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,720
input price ratio

830
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,919
that's the general formula so general

831
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,800
formula is you set minus m

832
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:45,720
l over

833
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:48,280
mpk equal to minus W over R that's the

834
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,119
general formula in our particular case

835
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:55,119
that amounts to K Over L equals a

836
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,119
half yeah

837
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,280
is there

838
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,920
version that's a really interesting

839
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,000
question um that we won't really get

840
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,160
into I think the difference is actually

841
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,040
I will teach you why I won't get into it

842
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,400
because firms you're it's a good segue

843
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,079
to why firms are not the same as

844
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,599
consumers and I'll talk about that in a

845
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,920
minute other questions okay well that's

846
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,720
a great segue which is when we did

847
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,040
consumer Theory we were done here we

848
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,640
said well I just find the point where

849
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,880
this is true

850
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,960
that's the optimal

851
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,720
bundle then I think comes substitution

852
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,839
effects and all that as was pointed

853
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:40,240
out this is why producer theory is

854
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:41,839
harder because we're not done why aren't

855
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,000
we done because I didn't tell you the

856
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,599
Right iso

857
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,599
cost with per consumer Theory I gave you

858
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,640
a budget

859
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,880
constraint I'm not giving you an ISO

860
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,800
cost here I'm just saying there are

861
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,359
multiple possible ISO costs therefore

862
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,920
there are multiple possible

863
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,160
tangencies so with consumer Theory I

864
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,200
gave you a budget constraint and

865
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,280
therefore I told you two equations and

866
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,800
two unknowns gives you the answer here

867
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,760
two equations two unknowns does not give

868
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,160
you the answer it just gives you a

869
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,359
formula but how you apply that formula

870
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,680
is going to depend on how big you want

871
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:16,880
your firm to be which isocost you want

872
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,560
to choose well how the hell you going to

873
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,599
choose that that's where we have to add

874
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,359
one more step that's where producer

875
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:29,560
Theory gets one step

876
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:29,560
harder to see that let's look at figure

877
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,240
65a figure

878
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,800
65a shows for different ISO

879
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,440
cost how much capital and labor we want

880
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,920
to use for our example so the previous

881
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,560
example we were at Point a we were

882
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,839
choosing to spend

883
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,480
$50 that allowed us to produce square

884
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,839
root of 12.5

885
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,560
units okay at a tangency of five units

886
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:58,359
of cap labor and two and a half units of

887
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,240
capital okay flip back and forth to

888
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,640
figure 64 you'll see that's where we

889
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,040
were

890
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,440
right however I could have said instead

891
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,240
no I want to be bigger I want to make

892
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,599
more I'm going to choose to spend 100

893
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:17,359
then I would be at point B where I could

894
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,800
have 20 units not 100 square of 50 it's

895
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,319
uh four times yeah yeah I'm going to

896
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:26,160
spend 200 okay so basically here if I

897
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:28,480
spend 200 I can have 20 workers and 10

898
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,720
machines I I spend 200 have 20 workers

899
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,119
of 10 machines and then I'll produce

900
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,599
square root of 50 which is right I don't

901
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,640
know I haven't told you yet how do you

902
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,160
choose as a boss remember capital's

903
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,000
fixed I'm talking about this is not the

904
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,880
Elon Musk example it's not Capital this

905
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
is within the short run this is how many

906
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,960
workers do you

907
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,400
hire well you don't know you could hire

908
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,800
10 workers 20 workers 30 workers it

909
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,400
depends how much you want to

910
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,760
produce how much you want to produce

911
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,400
that is the extra step we have to add

912
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,599
for Consumer for producer Theory

913
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,200
we call this the long run expansion

914
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:08,440
path this is

915
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,240
essentially the combinations of Labor

916
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,960
and

917
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:16,359
capital at every single Quee that you

918
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,440
would choose in other words you can map

919
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,000
out I haven't yet to told you which

920
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,200
queue you're going to choose but I've

921
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,119
told you how to map out for each Q how

922
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,640
much Ln K you want to

923
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,000
use if you decide the que you want a

924
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,800
square of 12 A2 you choose 10 workers

925
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and five machines if you decide it's a

926
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,359
square 112 A2 you choose 30 workers and

927
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,920
15

928
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,319
machines ultimately the question is how

929
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,640
much you want to

930
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:48,680
produce now in this example the long run

931
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,960
expansion path is linear but it doesn't

932
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:56,200
have to be for example consider figure

933
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,200
65b this is a long run expansion path

934
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,240
where capital is is becoming less

935
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,000
productive as you produce

936
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,760
more okay in 65a no matter how much you

937
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,119
produce you always want to use half as

938
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,359
much Capital as labor that ratio never

939
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,640
changes in 65b it does change that means

940
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,319
it's a different production

941
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,079
function I haven't written down the

942
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,560
underlying production function for 65b

943
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,079
but it's a different production function

944
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,920
the iso costs are the same the cost of

945
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,839
Labor and capital labor is always TW

946
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,240
half the price of capital but it's a

947
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,720
different production function which has

948
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,040
the feature that as you produce more and

949
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,240
more Capital becomes less productive you

950
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,839
might think of this as something like a

951
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,760
McDonald's long run expansion path once

952
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,960
they' got the fryolator and the

953
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,520
building then what really matters is how

954
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,440
many more workers you have you employ

955
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,920
there cranking stuff through so that's a

956
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,640
case where in some sense each additional

957
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,119
unit of capital the fry later isn't that

958
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,440
productive okay it's really labor which

959
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:52,839
is really the thing which you want more

960
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,920
and more of as you

961
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:59,040
expand alternatively you could have

962
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,800
something like figure 65

963
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,319
C which is an expansion path where

964
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,720
Capital becomes more productive and

965
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,280
labor becomes less

966
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:12,400
productive that is so that is you are

967
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,599
choosing relatively more and

968
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,400
more Capital compared to labor so let's

969
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:23,440
compare 65b to 65c in

970
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:26,400
65b when you go from point A to point C

971
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,160
you go from four workers to 15 workers

972
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,000
but only three machine to S and a half

973
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,520
machines okay go from point A to C and

974
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,760
65b the number of workers goes up almost

975
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,760
four times the number of machines only

976
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,440
goes up two and a half

977
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,880
times on the other hand with figure

978
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,440
65c the number of workers going from a

979
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,960
to c goes from 7 to 16 which is a little

980
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,640
more than twice the of machines goes

981
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,319
from 1.5 to 7 which is almost five times

982
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,760
as

983
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:56,240
much capital's becoming more productive

984
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,520
workers becom less productive in 65c

985
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,560
this might be something might Happ for

986
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,240
like a heavy machinery

987
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,599
plant okay where over time more you want

988
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,440
more and more machines and you fur and

989
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,839
fewer workers to run

990
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,440
them the point of this is not to say

991
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:11,720
that I can tell you what these speciic

992
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,760
examples are and each of these obviously

993
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,560
have different production functions

994
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,000
under them it's just to show you that

995
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,040
long run expansion paths can vary in the

996
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,280
real world it's basically a question of

997
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,680
as you want to produce

998
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,319
more does labor and capital become

999
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,119
equally more

1000
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:32,119
productive okay questions about

1001
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,119
that

1002
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,319
yeah down if I can't I haven't got

1003
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,319
talked about shutdown yet you're you're

1004
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:42,839
a bit ahead of me that that is related

1005
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:44,520
to how you're going to decide on your

1006
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,960
que and I'm gonna get to that next

1007
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,839
lecture okay so next lecture I haven't

1008
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,319
told you how you choose q but next

1009
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,560
lecture I will I'm going to choose the

1010
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:57,520
one extra step that lets you choose q

1011
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,640
but before I do I want to ask a sort of

1012
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,560
existential question which is how do we

1013
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,359
actually measure

1014
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,400
costs in the real world step four

1015
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:12,520
measuring

1016
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:16,599
costs and this is where I get to tell

1017
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:20,599
you that economics is just cooler than

1018
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:24,880
accounting and let me explain why

1019
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:28,520
okay accounting only considers the cash

1020
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,640
flow costs that you that you have when

1021
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,200
you start a firm economics more

1022
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,319
appropriately considers opportunity

1023
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,760
costs as

1024
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:41,240
well okay so

1025
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,680
profits is revenue Minus cost we're

1026
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,520
going to focus on the costs here costs

1027
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,440
and accounting are literally what you

1028
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,839
spend in economics they're what your

1029
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,359
opportunity cost is and those could

1030
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:56,160
differ so let me give you a simple

1031
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,559
example you're going to start a website

1032
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,440
design firm when you gradu that's kind

1033
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:00,559
of out of date but you know whatever

1034
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
okay you going to start a website design

1035
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,480
firm when you graduate okay and that

1036
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,960
involves you working

1037
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,440
full-time plus some slave programmer you

1038
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,640
can hire for $40,000 a year okay so

1039
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,599
you're going to work full-time and hire

1040
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,839
the program for $40,000 a year moreover

1041
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,000
you the program you don't even need to

1042
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,079
buy a computer for the programmer

1043
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,440
because you have an extra computer

1044
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,760
that's got one more year before it

1045
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,760
becomes useless so you can give that

1046
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,240
computer to the programmer and they can

1047
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,760
use that for the year so you're going

1048
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,160
have a one-year company okay you're

1049
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,079
going to pay it's you're going to work

1050
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,079
full-time you're going to pay your

1051
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,440
programmer $40,000 and you give your

1052
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,119
program or this computer you have that

1053
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,800
one more year to work and let's say your

1054
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,599
goal is by the end of year one I want to

1055
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,800
be making a profit okay my parents will

1056
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,000
be mad at me if I take more than one

1057
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,599
year with this by the end of year one I

1058
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,240
want to make a profit and let's say at

1059
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,480
the end of year one your revenues are

1060
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,400
$660,000

1061
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,440
we could say to your parents who are

1062
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,160
accountants well gee I earned

1063
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:05,160
$60,000 I paid my programmer

1064
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:07,280
$40,000 that's my cost so I made profit

1065
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,280
of

1066
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:14,000
$220,000 see my company's great your

1067
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,240
accounting parents we's say an

1068
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,800
accounting mom and economics dad the

1069
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,680
accounting mom is fool but the economics

1070
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,599
dad is not because what does the

1071
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,599
economics dad point

1072
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,960
out

1073
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,440
yeah yeah well go on what about let's

1074
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,440
talk about your

1075
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,800
time there's an opportunity cost of the

1076
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,160
year you spent with this firm and you're

1077
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,599
an MIT graduate for God's sake who knows

1078
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,400
you could have made like I don't know

1079
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:42,839
100K 200k who knows what you guys make

1080
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,200
these days okay let's say you could have

1081
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:47,079
made

1082
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,680
100K you did not make 100K by starting

1083
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:51,760
this firm that is a true economic cost

1084
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,319
it's not an accounting cost but it's a

1085
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,559
true economic cost it's an opportunity

1086
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:59,319
cost you gave up 100K to do this

1087
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:00,440
moreover that computer is still one year

1088
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:02,720
left you could have sold it for

1089
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,960
something there's an opportunity cost

1090
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,839
giving to this guy you could have sold

1091
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,200
it let's say you could have sold it for

1092
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:09,319
,000

1093
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:13,520
bucks so your opportunity costs are

1094
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:16,160
101,000 plus the 40 your total costs are

1095
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,240
141,000 this was a terrible

1096
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,680
idea okay your total cost of $141,000

1097
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,680
you've lost

1098
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:28,760
$81,000 okay opportunity costs are real

1099
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:32,440
costs opportunity

1100
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,960
costs are the value of the best NE the

1101
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,240
next best forone alternative remember

1102
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,839
that's why we call economics to dismal

1103
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,200
science we point out nothing's free your

1104
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,839
time wasn't free the time you dedicated

1105
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,480
to this firm meant you could have been

1106
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:48,160
doing something else and that's not free

1107
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,400
okay and as a result you are not making

1108
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,839
money in this company even if you think

1109
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,040
they are you are okay it's not saying we

1110
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,720
shouldn't do startups that lose money in

1111
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,119
the first year obviously most startups

1112
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,800
lose money in the first year okay we get

1113
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,960
to that later in the semester about how

1114
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,119
you think about money companies that

1115
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,599
lose money in the first year and make

1116
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,680
money in the second year we'll come back

1117
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:06,599
to that but in this simple example you

1118
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,760
shouldn't fool yourself to think that

1119
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:12,960
you actually made money because of the

1120
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,280
opportunity costs okay questions about

1121
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,079
that all right let's stop there thanks

1122
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,319
again for all the great questions today

1123
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:22,000
and we'll come back Wednesday and figure

1124
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,000
out how we pick our queue
