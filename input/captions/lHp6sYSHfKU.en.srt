(upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,920
- MIT teaches 11,000 students.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,881
It's about one in a million
people in the world.

4
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:10,350
The aspirations of open learning

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,410
is to reach a billion
learners of all geographies,

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,633
of all backgrounds, of all ages.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,570
- The vision behind MIT Learn

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,290
is to create a whole new
front door to the institute,

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,040
to give people one place
to go with their curiosity

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,980
and find the learning
opportunities they want

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,650
that meet their personal or career goals.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,690
You can find what you want to learn

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,280
the way you want to learn it,

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,530
from short one hour video introductions

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,373
to complex technical topics,
it's all here in one place.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,680
- [Speaker] AI is very central
to the way Learn works,

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
personalized instruction, the tutor,

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,873
the conversational TA and the syllabus.

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,190
- Our research shows that
learners evaluate carefully

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,900
a course before they commit.

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,590
For this reason, we have
designed Syllabus AI,

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,340
an AI chatbot that helps
learners make the decision

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,160
whether course is appropriate for them.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,840
- For example, I'm a biology major.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,900
I have taken the secret of
life, what is the next class?

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,280
And out of the entire catalog

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,790
of open learning, it selects
the appropriate classes

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,700
for that learner, a system
that really personalizes

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,650
to the understanding of the student.

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,960
- Great, it's told me
about a specific course

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,230
that is a prerequisite,
and I'm also curious,

32
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,090
I'm going to ask the Syllabus AI

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,940
what the main takeaways
are from this course.

34
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,130
- [Speaker] We have designed some AI tools

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,310
that will help learners deeply
engage with the content.

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,250
Learners can ask question
about video content,

37
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,810
generate video summary,

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,723
generate flash card from the
key ideas from the videos.

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,140
Tutor AI also help learners

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,570
as they work with the problem sets.

41
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,370
- Our Tutor AI will help you

42
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,560
as you're working through the solution,

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,405
but not provide an immediate answer.

44
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:01,470
- With the advancement of AI

45
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,440
and the AI infrastructure
we have built in MIT Learn,

46
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,150
we'll continue to innovate,

47
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,790
to use AI to improve MIT Learn

48
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,860
and offer personalized education

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,529
for anyone, anywhere in the world.
