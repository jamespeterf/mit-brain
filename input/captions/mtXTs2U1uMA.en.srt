1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,680
All right, I guess we'll get started.

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,720
Um, let's see. I wanted to just uh

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,359
finish up some discussion of topics from

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:29,199
linear algebra that um we didn't get to

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,719
the last math lecture. And um to begin

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,960
with, I think we did cover this topic of

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,920
igen values and igen vectors. Um these

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,320
uh linear algebra concepts turn out to

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,719
be very very useful in a number of

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:51,280
different uh applications. But um when

11
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:57,120
we have an igen value and igen vector uh

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:02,280
pair then for a matrix A that has an

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,280
igen vector V then

14
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,560
the matrix vector product is simply a

15
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,479
rescaling of that same vector. So matrix

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,320
multiplication when we use igen or

17
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,799
matrix vector multiplication when we use

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,680
igen vectors is very simple. We're just

19
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,680
rescaling the input. Um and in order to

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:30,320
solve for igen values and igen vectors

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,240
one can solve this equation where the

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,479
two are equal.

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,000
And

24
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:44,079
when we solve this equation um we want

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,600
the roots of the sort of determinant

26
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:52,079
equation to equal zero. Um this means

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:57,439
that um these are the igen values which

28
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,600
make this matrix factor a minus i lambda

29
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,560
uh non-invertible.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,840
So with a matrix

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,000
if that matrix has a determinant that is

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,760
in or has is if that matrix is

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,720
invertible then uh the determinant of

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
the matrix is non zero and the inverse

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,319
is actually functions of different

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,599
determinant co-actors. Um so in order

37
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,920
for V to not be zero

38
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,959
which would be the case if this matrix

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,440
were invertible uh we must have the

40
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,599
lambda satisfying this equation. And

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,440
this system of equations um is a

42
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,160
polomial

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,160
in lambda or at least the determinant

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,360
equaling zero corresponds to a polomial

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,840
in lambda equaling zero. So these things

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,480
can be solved very directly. Uh actually

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,200
in R you can actually compute the roots

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,840
of any polomial very easily. And then

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,560
once we've solved for

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,879
a root lambda then we can solve the

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,920
equations for what the V vector is that

52
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,920
satisfies that. Now let me put this in

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,920
here.

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,080
Um

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:24,000
okay it turns out that um if we have

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:28,000
independent igen vectors

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,879
then we can linearly independent igen

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,720
vectors. Um then we can comprise those

59
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:40,799
as columns of a matrix S

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:45,120
and the matrix A multiplied by this S

61
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,440
matrix will simply be the matrix of

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,360
multiples of the igen vector. So s

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:57,280
lambda lambda is a diagonal matrix and

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,680
the inverse matrix of s will exist so

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,200
long as we have independent igen

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,720
vectors.

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:10,799
And so this equation here can be used to

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,080
obtain a is s lambda s inverse.

69
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,560
Alternatively s inverse a s is equal to

70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:22,160
lambda. So these igen vectors

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,280
uh when comprising a matrix uh allow us

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,280
to uh diagonalize

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,759
a uh matrix A.

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,600
Now um

75
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,040
let's see

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,680
all right so IGEN values vectors can

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,080
come into play when we have equations

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:48,080
for common filters. Um if our matrix A

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,360
uh is transforming states at time t

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,560
minus one into states at time t and this

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,919
the dynamics of this process uh proceed

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,360
regularly over time increments given by

83
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,720
t. Then we simply have the teeth

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:10,240
transition from state zero is given by

85
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:13,039
the teeth power of a. Um and uh we can

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,759
actually get explicit solutions then

87
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:20,320
which end up

88
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:25,440
giving us um let's see at least if our

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,440
igen vectors v1 through vn are linearly

90
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,720
independent

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,600
then if we have an initial condition u

92
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
not we can express that initial

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,320
condition as a linear combination of the

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,080
igen vector vectors

95
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:46,240
and then we can represent the transition

96
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,440
over t periods to have this form and it

97
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,680
ends up just being a sum of multiples of

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,440
the igen vectors

99
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:59,280
uh with the coefficients being powers of

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,039
the igen values. So in looking at this

101
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,840
mathematically

102
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:08,960
one can see that if the igen values

103
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,560
lambda 1 to lambda n

104
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,240
are smaller than one in magnitude

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,639
then

106
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:22,080
this sort of limiting state transition

107
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,039
goes to a zero vector.

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,919
If

109
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,560
the one of the igen values is equal to

110
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,240
one,

111
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,560
then this term here won't change with

112
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,479
each transition. And so we'll have a

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,639
limiting value of the state that

114
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,680
corresponds to a multiple of the first

115
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,960
igen vector. And so um what's

116
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,800
interesting to anticipate is that there

117
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,319
will be different kinds of problems we

118
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:57,120
work with where the igen values may

119
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,720
actually uh be such that the largest

120
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,720
igen value is equal to one and uh the

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,880
other igen values are smaller than one

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,039
in magnitude and so we can get nice uh

123
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,280
analytic representations for the

124
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,160
transition of the states.

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,120
All right. Well, um,

126
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,639
from linear algebra courses, you

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,960
probably remember that if we have a

128
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:30,520
symmetric real matrix, so if this matrix

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,520
here is n byn and it's symmetric

130
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,440
and it's real, uh, then

131
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,800
all of the igen values of this matrix

132
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,880
are real as well.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,599
And

134
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:51,280
if we have two distinct igen values

135
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,360
then the igen vectors corresponding to

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,160
those two

137
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:05,039
values are orthogonal to each other. So

138
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:10,319
if we have a v1 equals lambda 1 v1 and a

139
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:14,319
v2 is equal to lambda 2 v2

140
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,639
um then it turns out that v1

141
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:22,400
do v2

142
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:24,000
is equal to zero. Um and uh you know

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,759
this

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,560
is

145
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:34,000
useful at least if we're with linear

146
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:37,200
algebra we often want to uh represent

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,680
multi-dimensional vectors in terms of

148
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,240
some basis.

149
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,600
And so um if we think of

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:53,200
our matrix A equaling

151
00:08:47,600 --> 00:09:00,320
a vector A1 A2 up to A N.

152
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:05,120
Um if the matrix A has full rank,

153
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,360
then these columns of A are linearly

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,160
independent.

155
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:17,120
And we could use these column vectors as

156
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:21,920
a basis for the n-dimensional space. So,

157
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,839
so if the rank of a

158
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:33,160
is equal to n, then um the collection of

159
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,160
a j's j equaling one to n forms a basis.

160
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:42,959
And if we have a matrix A

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:47,360
that maybe is symmetric

162
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:53,040
but has en values that are all distinct,

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:55,600
then we actually could have so if A

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:01,560
is symmetric

165
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,560
and all the EEN values are distinct

166
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,279
Then

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,120
the collection of igen vectors VJ J

168
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,800
equaling 1 to uh N.

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,640
This would correspond to an orthogonal

170
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,279
basis.

171
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,360
And so when representing

172
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,200
n vectors,

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,839
it's convenient to represent them in a

174
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,640
coordinate system that has sort of

175
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:37,760
orthogonal axes in it.

176
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:42,959
Um now what's interesting is that

177
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,760
um when a is symmetric and real um the

178
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,800
uh all the igen values are real. It

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,399
turns out that there exists

180
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,920
an

181
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,360
orthogonal

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,560
set of igen vectors in that general

183
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:05,920
case. So um so that can be very useful.

184
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:09,200
Um all right. Well uh a very important

185
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,680
linear algebra

186
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,440
result is the singular value

187
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,760
decomposition.

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,760
And let me just ask how many people here

189
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
have covered singular value

190
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,839
decompositions?

191
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,440
Just about everybody. Okay. So who would

192
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,120
like to explain to me uh what or explain

193
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,079
to the class what a singular value

194
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,079
decomposition is?

195
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,560
So let me write this

196
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,839
maybe as the singular value

197
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,680
decomposition in my notation.

198
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,120
So who

199
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,120
would like to explain what this is?

200
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Anybody?

201
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,040
>> Yes. expresses the matrix A as a sum of

202
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,360
orthogonal run one matrices.

203
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,880
>> So um

204
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,120
U is such that U transpose

205
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:13,360
U is equal to say the identity it has

206
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,000
orthogonal columns. Um V is the same

207
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,959
thing

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,959
and D is a diagonal.

209
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:29,200
And so um what's important is that any

210
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,480
matrix

211
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,320
can be expressed as the factor of

212
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
a V

213
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,160
transpose which is an orthogonal matrix

214
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,839
that will sort of transform coordinate

215
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,519
axes to new axes that are orthogonal in

216
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,360
the same space. And then D is a diagonal

217
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
matrix

218
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,240
down to D

219
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,279
well I'll write D R

220
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,600
where um the uh we basically are

221
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:07,120
stretching and squeezing axes and then u

222
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,279
is simply has columns that define a new

223
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,680
basis or a new vector space and we're

224
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,560
taking sums of those. So, so it's

225
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,519
interesting to represent any matrix

226
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,040
as this

227
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,360
um

228
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,440
operator which will sort of or do an

229
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
orthogonal transformation of axes

230
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,800
stretch and squeeze in that transformed

231
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:39,519
space and then use those to uh multiply

232
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,920
uh new coordinate vectors u. Now to um

233
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,079
if if we take

234
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,839
sort of any uh let's say here an M byN

235
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,839
matrix

236
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,839
A

237
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,279
um

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,639
and it's often the case that we have

239
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,959
maybe m cases in a data set and n

240
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,480
variables

241
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,560
and so this corresponds to a data matrix

242
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,639
for

243
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,639
an analysis of some data. Um if we take

244
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,959
a transpose a then this is a symmetric

245
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,959
real matrix

246
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:30,880
and so this actually um can be

247
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,480
diagonalized to v

248
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:40,160
d^2 vtranspose

249
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:45,279
where I'm representing the igen values

250
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:50,800
as they're the squared d values and the

251
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:54,399
uh igen vectors as columns of v. And so

252
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,880
one can sort of construct this do the

253
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,440
igen value igen vector decomposition

254
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:08,120
here and then we can take the matrix A

255
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,120
premultiply by V and um

256
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,240
or not premultiply post multiply by V

257
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,480
and post multiply by D inverse

258
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:22,160
and this will basically be our U matrix.

259
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,440
Now all of this is a bit casual with my

260
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,360
notation. Um

261
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:34,320
the number of sort of nonzero

262
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:40,720
diagonal entries here can be limited to

263
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:44,720
the rank count of the matrix A. And so

264
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:49,680
um you know that's the way it uh can

265
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:53,440
play out. So we basically have nonzero

266
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,519
values of aranspose a there will be are

267
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,279
the rank nonzero values.

268
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,360
um we can define the orthogonal

269
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,880
orthonormal igen vectors corresponding

270
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,920
to those and then if we want to sort of

271
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:16,399
expand the orthonormal basis of the

272
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:20,000
first rig vectors to be an n-dimensional

273
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:24,880
uh basis um although they essentially

274
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:29,279
aren't used um and uh so that gives us

275
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:33,839
our uh singular decomposition.

276
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,839
And it turns out that in dealing with um

277
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,839
data

278
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,240
in a matrix, um the singular value

279
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,880
decomposition allows us to reduce

280
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,320
dimensionality. Perhaps there's

281
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:54,000
variation in the data values that is

282
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,199
limited to a subspace

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,440
of rank two or three.

284
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:04,240
And so we can identify and specify that

285
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,319
uh subspace easily with the singular

286
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,959
value decompositions.

287
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,199
All right. Um

288
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,240
let's see.

289
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,679
Okay. So in these notes I refer to a

290
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,720
reduced SVD. Um what's rather

291
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:25,039
interesting as a decomposition of the

292
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,079
matrix A is that it's a sum

293
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:32,559
of R terms where R is the rank of the

294
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,880
matrix. And those R terms are the

295
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,679
products of

296
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,720
the column vectors of U times the column

297
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,160
vector transpose of V

298
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,000
respectively um with the singular value

299
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:55,120
sigma 1 through sigma R. So it's um

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,080
provides a nice way of uh thinking of a

301
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,799
matrix. It's simply a sum of rank one

302
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,160
terms.

303
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,240
Okay. Um let's see these lecture notes

304
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,039
on linear algebra finishes with the

305
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:16,720
coron uh frobinius theorem and this

306
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,880
theorem relates to matrices

307
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,840
that are square

308
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,840
with positive strictly positive

309
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:31,280
elements. And so with such matrices

310
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,880
the theorem states that there is

311
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,840
an igen value a real value lambda kn

312
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,000
that is bigger than any in magnitude

313
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,919
than any other

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,520
igen values

315
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,919
and corresponding to this igen value

316
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,760
lambda kn

317
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:54,080
we can define an igen vector v

318
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,400
which

319
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,240
has elements that are all positive as

320
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,480
well.

321
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,880
And uh this lambda knot

322
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,720
value the largest one

323
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,960
is

324
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,440
alone in terms of all other values are

325
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,280
smaller in magnitude

326
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,080
and this result turns out to be uh very

327
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,760
useful um in working with positive

328
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,679
matrices.

329
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,960
The notes here go through the proof of

330
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,720
that. Um I guess they're included here

331
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,400
if we wanted to sort of get into

332
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,679
technical proofs of uh linear algebra.

333
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,000
Um and I don't want to do that. Uh let's

334
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,880
see. I finished the these notes with

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,919
just some mention of different news

336
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:51,200
sources that you should consider uh

337
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:53,039
exploring with uh in finance and uh with

338
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,799
well there's Yahoo Finance which is

339
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:59,440
where we can easily collect price data.

340
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:04,000
Um but you should know that the Wall

341
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,919
Street Journal is um there are you can

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,320
get a free subscription with that

343
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:12,960
through uh your Keraros password or ID

344
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,799
rather. So so that's very useful and

345
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,120
then there are a number of other sites

346
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:22,559
that uh you may may find useful. Now um

347
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,760
let's see when uh

348
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:30,000
let's see in our very first lecture

349
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:33,679
um let's see I indicated

350
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,400
um how we could use our studio to

351
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,360
collect data plot time series of

352
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,080
different stocks or other assets. And in

353
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:47,600
this lecture two, I distributed

354
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,360
um this uh workspace which has uh our

355
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,480
scripts

356
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,520
um and output for

357
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,120
looking at uh portfolios of stocks and

358
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,000
considering sort of equal weighted

359
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:07,840
portfolios with different uh components

360
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,919
in the equal weights. And so with uh

361
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:16,919
let's see if you go to uh the rcloud

362
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,919
uh

363
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:26,440
our studio cloud project. Um so with R

364
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,440
Studio cloud

365
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,960
um or maybe it's cloud R studio um one

366
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
can

367
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:46,159
um upload different u our programs in

368
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:50,080
this uh in this project and so I don't

369
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,960
has anyone in class yet used our our

370
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,600
Studio Cloud for any of the examples. I

371
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,440
I'd like some I'd like everyone to at

372
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,200
least be capable of doing that and uh

373
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,559
I'd like sort of proof that it actually

374
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,720
works with students doing it. So um it

375
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,280
would be great for some of you to uh to

376
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,440
consider that. What's what's nice about

377
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:17,520
this um environment is that I can give

378
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,240
you an R program and it should run just

379
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:25,440
by saying run. you don't have to install

380
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:29,679
anything. And uh let's see with this

381
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:33,280
output um let's see there's one program

382
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,559
called script SP500

383
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,919
and there's a table of contents for this

384
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,840
R script which says it loads libraries

385
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,240
then collects stock prices and then

386
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,360
saves the workspace.

387
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:52,880
So the commands are all very simple in

388
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,559
here. Um and uh and then

389
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,799
let's see with the equal weighted

390
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,320
portfolios

391
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:04,880
script it actually loads libraries

392
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:07,600
and loads the data set of stock prices

393
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:13,200
that was just downloaded in the other

394
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:19,039
program and it uh loads the data in.

395
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:24,159
Then in processing the data um

396
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:30,240
I uh let's see consider investing

397
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:32,240
a portfolio by equally weighting uh

398
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,919
allocations to different stocks in the

399
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:41,679
S&P 500 index. And so if one does this,

400
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,640
these simple R commands create the uh

401
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,960
value of such a portfolio

402
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,000
where in fact

403
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,400
um as indicated here it's investing

404
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,720
$1,000

405
00:23:52,400 --> 00:24:00,080
at the beginning of uh 2019.

406
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,799
And as an alternative to just equally

407
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:08,960
waiting across the S&P 500 stocks, um I

408
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:11,039
looked at the Amazon, Apple, uh Nvidia

409
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,880
or no, Netflix and Google. These were

410
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,720
actually they're really hot stocks about

411
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,919
four or five years ago and uh basically

412
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:24,159
look at equal waiting of all these. And

413
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,159
so here's how uh the investment

414
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,679
equal weighted at the beginning of the

415
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,679
period resulted towards the end. So so

416
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:36,000
there are some interesting features uh

417
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,880
one can see if one happened to

418
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,720
be good at identifying stocks to invest

419
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,240
in. You can do much better than sort of

420
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:48,159
the average S&P 500. um there can be

421
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,400
greater risk

422
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,320
by investing in a smaller number of

423
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
stocks because you're not so

424
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,200
diversified.

425
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:04,559
And so you can see how the red uh the

426
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:07,279
red uh graph of values sort of decreases

427
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,720
rather dramatically at some points in in

428
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,600
the time period. And

429
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,760
if one looks at sort of what happened to

430
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,799
the $250 invested in each of those uh

431
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,679
four stocks, this is what happened over

432
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,440
this uh whatever fiveyear period or

433
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,600
almost fiveyear period. And this this

434
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,120
raises some interesting issues for us,

435
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,520
which is when considering portfolio

436
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,200
construction,

437
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,840
um

438
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,760
maybe equally weighting allocations

439
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,640
across some assets is a good thing to

440
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,960
start with. But what happens

441
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,120
over time?

442
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,440
Well, in this case, um, Apple

443
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,799
outgrew the other allocations

444
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,919
substantially and so the degree of

445
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,840
diversification in the portfolio is

446
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,200
getting lower because we have a greater

447
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:12,799
concentration in that one stock. So what

448
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:15,919
we'd like to do perhaps is to balance

449
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,919
rebalance the portfolio

450
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:23,120
and um different approaches to

451
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:28,320
rebalancing portfolios can be uh

452
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,840
considered. Now, um, if we were to

453
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,720
consider

454
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:38,640
sort of rebalancing every day

455
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,320
the investments in these four stocks,

456
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,480
then

457
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,600
would you think that's a really good way

458
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:51,000
to rebalance to do it very very

459
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,000
frequently? And why or why not?

460
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,400
>> Yes. Well, if you do it too frequently,

461
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,120
then like variances like in 2022 might

462
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,600
like affect it, but it won't be very

463
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,919
like good for the big picture.

464
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,760
>> Yeah. I mean, it's uh if you rebalance

465
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:11,120
too quickly, then you're taking

466
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,120
funds away from winners and giving those

467
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,000
to losers.

468
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,720
And so you're sort of equalizing

469
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,880
allocations in a way that doesn't

470
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,919
benefit from

471
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,760
short-term trends or strengths in

472
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,400
different assets.

473
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:34,080
So uh so that extreme is is uh probably

474
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,720
not something you want to do. Um, one

475
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,799
thing that's rather interesting is just

476
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,039
how if you do not do any rebalancing

477
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:48,159
then the portfolios

478
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:51,279
become rather uh uh undiversified

479
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,399
and so the risk level is actually

480
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,200
probably increasing um over time here.

481
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,120
So if you know one way of rebalancing

482
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,480
portfolios is trying to maintain a

483
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,240
certain risk level for the portfolio and

484
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,880
uh such an objective would require

485
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,039
periodic rebalancing.

486
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,760
Okay. Um

487
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,039
well let's

488
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,679
move on then to

489
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,679
the uh

490
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:31,360
topic of probability theory. And so what

491
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,279
I want to do in this note is to just

492
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:38,240
give you a quick overview

493
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,919
basically a review of uh probability

494
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,799
concepts that you probably are very

495
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:48,720
familiar with. Um and so uh with

496
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:52,880
probability theory um it's customary to

497
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:56,159
distinguish between discrete valued

498
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,919
random variables and or and continuous

499
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,320
ones. And so with discrete valued random

500
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,200
variables, you know, those can be just

501
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,200
events occurring or not like a default

502
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,200
of a counterparty or um maybe the

503
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:17,279
federal uh open market committee

504
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:21,200
deciding on a Fed funds rate. Um the uh

505
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:25,440
let's see in thinking of individual

506
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,240
uh stocks and their dynamics uh intraday

507
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,360
one can think of different orders for a

508
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,520
stock to buy or sell coming in uh at

509
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,799
random and wondering what side those

510
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:44,159
would be on. Also perhaps the share size

511
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:47,039
of uh the next market order. Um it you

512
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,840
now the now it used to be that these

513
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,679
were always discreet sort of outcomes

514
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,919
like share size. It turns out you can

515
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,840
actually now invest fractionally

516
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,880
fractional shares in different stocks.

517
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:04,720
So the markets become uh more uh rich in

518
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,760
that way. Um but importantly we do want

519
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,399
to distinguish between discrete outcomes

520
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,039
that have probabilities

521
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,760
uh with respective outcomes versus

522
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:20,159
continuous random variables where we're

523
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,000
thinking of uh values that could take on

524
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,520
any value in some interval or range. And

525
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,120
so

526
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,000
in thinking about the values of assets,

527
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,440
we can think of the value being in a in

528
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,240
a continuous range. Also,

529
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:44,080
timing of events is a uh an important um

530
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,399
random variable that is continuous as

531
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,279
well. So um one might consider what is

532
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:56,240
the waiting time to the next market

533
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:59,919
order for uh Apple stock. Um

534
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:04,159
mixed variables uh can arise where we

535
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,320
think of a stock having some value

536
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,919
where it's generally a positive value

537
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,080
but it could go bankrupt in which case

538
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,600
um there would perhaps be some discrete

539
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:22,000
probability of bankruptcy for a stock.

540
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:25,919
Um now with probability models we use

541
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,720
probability mass functions for discrete

542
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:32,080
variables and probability densities for

543
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,039
continuous and so we use calculus to

544
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,880
calculate continuous probabilities

545
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,799
in different intervals. Um and

546
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,360
importantly uh the cumulative

547
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:47,120
distribution function

548
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,279
is a very important

549
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,919
uh tool.

550
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:55,519
So if we write fubx of let me write c is

551
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,039
equal to probability that the random

552
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:04,480
variable x is less than or equal to c as

553
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:09,279
a function of c. Um this

554
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:13,200
value is going to be no

555
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,960
at no smaller than zero and no larger

556
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,960
than one

557
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,120
and it will be monotone increasing

558
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,200
in C.

559
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,919
um and

560
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,880
distributions will be uniquely specified

561
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:33,120
by specifying their uh cumulative

562
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:37,440
distribution function. So these are uh

563
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,360
very simple concepts. Um

564
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,080
let's see there are expectations in

565
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,720
moments. Um

566
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,120
let's see one just uh I'll just call

567
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,120
this an anecdote.

568
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,720
Um

569
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,120
if X is continuous

570
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:04,640
random variable

571
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:07,200
um and we define Y equal to F of X.

572
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,919
So we consider the probability integral

573
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,519
transform

574
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:18,039
of the random variable X.

575
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,039
What is the distribution of Y?

576
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,679
Okay.

577
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,559
>> Unable.

578
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,080
>> Yeah, it's uniform

579
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:50,000
zero. It's uniform on zero.

580
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,159
So what's really neat is that sort of a

581
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,039
monotone transform of the random

582
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,000
variable X whatever X is so long as we

583
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:03,039
know what the distribution is transforms

584
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,519
that to a uniform. And so this is true

585
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,600
regardless of what f is so long as f is

586
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,760
continuous.

587
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:15,679
And uh that property can be turn out to

588
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,480
be very very useful. Um

589
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,200
one issue could be oh suppose you have a

590
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,280
random sample of data from some

591
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,879
distribution or you think it's from some

592
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,520
distribution.

593
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,520
Is the sample consistent with that

594
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,320
distribution or not? Well, if you did

595
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,639
this probability integral transform,

596
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,919
it should lead to a uniform distribution

597
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,159
which may or may not be realized. So

598
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,520
anyway, that's turns out to be quite

599
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,079
quite uh useful. Now, uh we have

600
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,000
expectations and moments of random

601
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,679
variables.

602
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,599
Um basically the mean of a random

603
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,680
variable is the probability weighted

604
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,720
outcome. We can generalize the mean to

605
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,520
looking at which is the first moment to

606
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,960
consider the probability weighted

607
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:13,520
average of the kith power where k is an

608
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,079
integer. And um the variance of random

609
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:22,160
variables is a useful measure of

610
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:25,119
uncertainty about the mean value. And uh

611
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,400
there's a nice formula for the variance

612
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,560
which is the squared distance from the

613
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,800
mean in terms of the average squared

614
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,760
minus the square of the average. So

615
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,359
these are useful

616
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,240
uh formulas that may come in be useful

617
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,240
at certain times. Now um in terms of

618
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,280
measuring uncertainty

619
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,240
about outcomes

620
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,839
instead of the variance

621
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,119
taking the square root of the variance

622
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:02,160
is useful because its scale is the same

623
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,320
as the original units. Most people don't

624
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:10,079
think in terms of squared units with any

625
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,520
problem. Um, and so instead of dealing

626
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,839
with the variance directly, we'll

627
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,640
commonly take the square root of that to

628
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:22,640
have the same units as our original

629
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,040
variable x. Now, with the uh with

630
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,119
skewess

631
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,760
and curtosis, we're looking at measures

632
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,920
of sort of the shape of the

633
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,880
distribution.

634
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,480
And with skewess, as you might

635
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,760
anticipate,

636
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,760
that detects a symmetry in a

637
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,440
distribution. And so something that's

638
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:54,079
nice to think about is um if we have a

639
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:58,079
random variable X where um the expected

640
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:01,359
value of X is equal to mu and the square

641
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,800
root of the variance

642
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,000
is sigma. Um

643
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:14,960
if we take Z

644
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,480
= X - mu over sigma. This is a

645
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,400
standardization of the random variable.

646
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:27,920
um the expected value of Z will equal

647
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,760
zero and the variance of Z will equal

648
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,640
one

649
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,000
as will the square root of the variance

650
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,040
and for the skewess

651
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,079
which I use I guess it's a gamma

652
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,160
gamma is equal to the expected value of

653
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,599
Z cubed and the curtosis

654
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,520
is equal to the expected value of Z to

655
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,680
the 4th.

656
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,280
So

657
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,760
the skewess and curtosis parameters of a

658
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,800
distribution

659
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,440
can measure asymmetry at least if the

660
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,800
cubed value has more weight on the

661
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:14,240
positive end than the negative end. Um

662
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:17,839
it'll be skewed to the right. And um

663
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,160
with the kappa uh we're looking at Z to

664
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:23,520
the 4th. So we're looking at basically

665
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:29,920
how heavy are the tails

666
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:31,520
and um the uh let's see for a Gaussian

667
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,520
distribution

668
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:42,640
kappa is equal to three or normal 01

669
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:45,839
or any normal um and uh

670
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,040
gamma is equal to zero. So anyway, so

671
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,440
these other parameters are useful for

672
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,359
characterizing distributions that are

673
00:38:51,440 --> 00:39:01,359
not Gaussian and non-gaussian terms of

674
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:06,240
perhaps skewess or heavier tails. Um

675
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:08,960
all right well let's uh just review

676
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,880
Gaussian distributions.

677
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,000
Um

678
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,560
I hope this formula for the density of a

679
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,040
Gaussian is very familiar to everyone

680
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,200
here. Um we basically have the uh

681
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,839
density function

682
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,839
is uh

683
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:37,520
equal to 1 / <unk>2 pi

684
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:39,119
sigma e minus a half x - mu over sigma^

685
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,400
2.

686
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,720
And so um

687
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,480
the mean is mu, the variance is sigma

688
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,920
squared and uh the density function is

689
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:57,440
symmetrical with a maximum at the mean

690
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:01,520
mu and the points of inflection are

691
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:07,200
actually at plus and minus sigma. So if

692
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,680
we think of just trying to draw a normal

693
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,280
density function

694
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,480
then

695
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,000
the peak is at the mean and the point of

696
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,359
inflection

697
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,720
where the second derivative

698
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,119
is zero. It goes from

699
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,640
negative second derivative to a positive

700
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,560
second derivative. that distance is is

701
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,280
sigma

702
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:38,560
symmetrically. Um

703
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:42,400
so uh all right so let's take a look at

704
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:46,320
the normal bell curve. Um

705
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,680
68% lies within one standard deviation.

706
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,760
So this is you know the whatever you

707
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,400
know AP statistics you learn these

708
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,440
facts. Um if we go to two standard

709
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,760
deviations from the mean that's 95%

710
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:06,240
and three standard deviations is 99.7%.

711
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,920
So um so these models are um normal

712
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,800
models have have these sort of

713
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,599
properties of how likely different

714
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,400
variations are in standard deviation

715
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:21,280
units. Um

716
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,440
well in finance we'd like to

717
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,920
exploit perhaps Gaussian distributions

718
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,960
for modeling prices.

719
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,280
Um and uh

720
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:37,280
with a normal density curve it actually

721
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,640
um applies to x values that can be

722
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,720
arbitrarily large negative or positive.

723
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,119
It's an unbounded

724
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,400
distribution in terms of potential

725
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,119
outcomes. And so one way of dealing with

726
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:56,240
that with say prices

727
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:59,280
um is to consider taking the log of

728
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,359
prices and thinking of that being a

729
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,680
normal distribution.

730
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:09,280
And so that con construction corresponds

731
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,960
to a lognormal uh distribution.

732
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,240
And so if we have a random variable X

733
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:20,800
that's normal and then we take the

734
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:24,319
exponential of that normal then we say

735
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,640
that the Y variable is logn normal with

736
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:32,000
the parameters mu and sigma squar

737
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,520
corresponding to the log scale. Now um

738
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,160
what

739
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,640
will be very interesting

740
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,960
in subsequent lectures is when we talk

741
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:47,760
about uh stochcastic processes

742
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,640
that can be um applied in uh financial

743
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,680
markets. There's an important

744
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,200
stochcastic process called brownie in

745
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,560
motion

746
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,240
which um many of you probably have some

747
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:06,720
familiarity with. And with a brownie in

748
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,960
motion process, the increments

749
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,359
of the process

750
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,760
over time periods

751
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,880
has a distribution

752
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,240
that's normally distributed.

753
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,640
And as the length of the increment of

754
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,000
time increases

755
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,520
both the mean and variance of the

756
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,800
outcome

757
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,240
changes. And so this Brownian motion

758
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:38,640
process is a very very interesting

759
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,599
process that is um intimately related to

760
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,400
Gaussian distribution. So so we'll get

761
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:49,119
we'll get there um in a few lectures.

762
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:53,119
Now um one of the useful tools we have

763
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,720
in probability theory is being able to

764
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,480
derive

765
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,440
uh the distributions of transformations

766
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,400
of random variables. So with the log

767
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,800
normal we have a normal distribution.

768
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,520
We maybe take the exponential of that

769
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,640
normal outcome and we'd like to be able

770
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,640
to write down the density of that

771
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:21,599
distribution and compute different

772
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:25,040
features. Well, um we can think of say a

773
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,760
random variable X being transformed to Y

774
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:33,200
with a function G.

775
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:37,280
And then we can consider the function h

776
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,760
which is the inverse function of g.

777
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,520
And

778
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:47,520
as examples, if g is e to the x, then h

779
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:51,599
is the log um function.

780
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,720
And with change of variables, if we have

781
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:59,359
the CDF of X,

782
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:03,760
um, then the CDF of Y

783
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:08,079
is equal to the CDF of X evaluated at

784
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,720
the inverse of Y on the X scale. So this

785
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,280
equation here is

786
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,400
a simple sort of logical statement

787
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:21,760
that's everyone here I think would agree

788
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:24,079
is valid. And so if this function

789
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,800
relating the distribution functions is

790
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:33,040
true. If we take the derivative

791
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:36,800
of the CDF function

792
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:39,280
of Y, we get the density.

793
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,480
And then we just have to apply the chain

794
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:47,440
rule on the right hand side,

795
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:50,160
the density of X evaluated at H of Y.

796
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:56,000
But then we also need to have the chain

797
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:59,280
rule for H in there. So with this

798
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,520
formula um

799
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,520
right it's

800
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:11,839
all sort of familiar but if we have um f

801
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:17,839
of um x is equal to the integral minus

802
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:21,920
infinity to x of f ofx f of t dt rather

803
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:25,920
then the derivative

804
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:33,319
of f evaluated at x turns out to be

805
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,319
equal to f of t evaluated at t = x.

806
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,720
So the cumulative integral has a

807
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,880
derivative equal to the argument of the

808
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,920
integral. So this is easy and we can use

809
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,040
this to get the density function for a

810
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,280
logn normal distribution.

811
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,640
And

812
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,040
here's the density of the

813
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:01,040
log normal distribution. It has the same

814
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:05,920
form as the Gaussian density plugging in

815
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:10,720
log y instead of e for x. But then we

816
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:14,640
need to multiply that by the uh chain

817
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:18,240
rule sort of derivative of uh h with

818
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,760
respect to y which is 1 over y. Okay.

819
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,839
Okay, so here's the logn normal

820
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,920
distribution

821
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:28,400
and as an example I chose a mean log

822
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:33,920
value of 0.2

823
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:36,079
and a SD on the log scale of 0.4 four

824
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:41,760
and as you work with different

825
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:44,400
distributions um you may have uh

826
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,200
let's see suggest or not suggestions but

827
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,720
you may find it useful to consider

828
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,760
specific parameter values here I'm

829
00:47:50,720 --> 00:48:01,119
thinking that if one has a

830
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:06,240
um if we think of say x of zero equaling

831
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:09,560
one and x of one being distributed as a

832
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,560
log normal

833
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:17,119
with mu equal to 2 and sigma equal to 04

834
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,960
then

835
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:24,720
this uh logn normal distribution can

836
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,880
correspond to sort of a one-year

837
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,760
period

838
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:36,319
where on the log scale we expect a mean

839
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:40,720
change on the log scale to be 0.2

840
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:45,280
and with standard deviation of 04. So

841
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:47,200
this would potentially be relevant for

842
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,040
an asset

843
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,079
and looking at its sort of percentage

844
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:56,319
change on the log scale over one year

845
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,760
with an annualized return of about 20%

846
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,280
and annualized standard deviation of

847
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,880
0.4.

848
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,400
Well, if we draw vertical lines in this

849
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,079
distribution

850
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,640
space or sample space of the log normal,

851
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:16,079
um, here I've just drawn symmetrical

852
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:18,800
percentiles of 25th and 75th percentiles

853
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,160
and then the fifth and 95th percentiles

854
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:24,559
in red. And it's obvious that it's

855
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,040
asymmetrical.

856
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,480
And uh

857
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,520
what's uh

858
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,599
in what's useful actually with um

859
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,440
different distributions is being able to

860
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,839
calculate

861
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,079
quantities of interest in finance. And

862
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:47,440
so here's a nice example of uh a

863
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:50,880
financial um computation

864
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:54,960
uh where we consider a call option to

865
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:58,880
buy an asset at some terminal time

866
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:04,400
capital T and the strike price is going

867
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:09,839
to be at price K. And so um if we think

868
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:15,040
of X being the random variable of what

869
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:18,240
the time t price is, then the payoff is

870
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:22,480
going to be equal to

871
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:27,280
X minus K the value minus the strike

872
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:33,520
price if that's positive or it won't be

873
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:38,480
worth anything. So um if we have at time

874
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:43,839
t um let's say if we were to draw here

875
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:47,680
as a function p subt or sorry x I guess

876
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:50,400
and there's a strike price here then we

877
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,040
would have the zero value up to k and

878
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,920
then we'd have

879
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,960
um x minus k

880
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,800
be giving this option payoff. off. Now,

881
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,319
you'll hear

882
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:08,160
Vasili and Jake talk about the hockey

883
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,559
stick payoff function of options. And

884
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:16,480
so, this is what that

885
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:20,160
comes from. Now what's interesting to

886
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:25,119
know is this theorem here says that if

887
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:29,760
we have a density function little f with

888
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:33,920
cdf capital f for the outcome at time

889
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:37,559
capital t. Then the expected value of

890
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,559
this payoff

891
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:46,559
is equal to this integral from the

892
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:53,720
strike to infinity of 1 - f ofx.

893
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:53,720
And the proof of this is done by

894
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:03,119
considering a finite upper limit m

895
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:06,400
capital m and then integrating by parts

896
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:10,480
and getting a formula here. So it's an

897
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:16,079
interesting result that

898
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:18,800
if we know the terminal time t

899
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:22,880
random price

900
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:28,319
uh of a random of of an asset then a

901
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:32,400
call option on that uh terminal value uh

902
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:35,839
will have this expected value.

903
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:39,680
So, um let's see. Those of you who

904
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:46,480
actually have some advanced probability

905
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:51,520
coursework may notice that um when you

906
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:54,000
uh are looking at sort of um the

907
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,280
expected value of a positive random

908
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,880
variable, you can sometimes express that

909
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:04,720
as an integral of the sort of

910
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,400
complimementaryary probability of

911
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:11,280
exceeding that value and so that's that

912
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:15,119
sort of result ends up being applicable

913
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,480
here in a very nice way. Um now with a

914
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:21,359
normal with distribution for X we get

915
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,559
this formula coming out for that call

916
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:26,720
option and if we have a log normal we

917
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,440
get this different

918
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,720
distribu this different result. So

919
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:38,880
knowing the distribution uh affects what

920
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:42,880
the option price is. Um now in

921
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:45,839
probability theory uh we make use of

922
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,839
moment generating functions which I

923
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:51,839
guess when I first learned of these I

924
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:54,400
thought well nice tool but I don't

925
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:57,680
really care at least you know it's a

926
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,720
highly technical tool to use. However,

927
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,160
um it turns out these are incredibly uh

928
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,559
useful moment generating functions and

929
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,680
the definition of the moment generating

930
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:13,000
function is

931
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,000
given by

932
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:21,319
looking at just the expected value of e

933
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,319
to the tx.

934
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:28,720
And

935
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:30,800
we can sort of expand this argument in a

936
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,119
tailaylor series

937
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,559
which is done

938
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,079
on the first line there and take the

939
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,079
expectation.

940
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,079
Now

941
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,760
something that we should be

942
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:52,240
questioning perhaps is do moment

943
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:55,680
generating functions always exist?

944
00:54:52,240 --> 00:55:01,119
And by that I mean do we get a finite

945
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:04,119
valued function mx of t for all random

946
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,119
variables.

947
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,760
>> Okay.

948
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,440
>> Hello

949
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,800
Sorry. Sorry.

950
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,200
>> That's right. No, no, that's fine.

951
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,880
That's right.

952
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,760
>> Sorry to my head and then I have to go.

953
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,440
>> Yeah, that's

954
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,599
the moment generating function doesn't

955
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,079
have to exist.

956
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,480
Um, and the moment generating function

957
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:42,880
won't exist if this exponential function

958
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,200
is has too much weight. So that integral

959
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,960
is infinite.

960
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:51,520
And an example where it is infinite is a

961
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,079
Koshy distribution.

962
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:57,680
And if you're a Koshy distribution

963
00:55:54,079 --> 00:56:01,280
doesn't have finite mean or variance. Um

964
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,440
but what's interesting is that

965
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,359
um this is called the moment generating

966
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,160
function.

967
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:13,520
There's a uh

968
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:17,400
a characteristic function

969
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,400
characteristic function

970
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,200
that turns out to be equal to e to the

971
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,200
tx

972
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:35,760
where i here is the square root of -1.

973
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,160
Um and if you uh know a little bit about

974
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,559
complex numbers,

975
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,319
this turns out to be equal to the cosine

976
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,720
of tx

977
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:48,480
plus i * the s of tx.

978
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,839
And it turns out that these

979
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,280
characteristic functions always exist

980
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:57,359
and can be used almost the same way a

981
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,960
moment generating function can be used

982
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,880
when it exists. So the fact that it

983
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,280
doesn't always exist shouldn't worry us

984
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,319
because we can generalize to

985
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,200
characteristic functions. But what's

986
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:15,040
what's important is that

987
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,839
um if we have two random variables that

988
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,359
have identical moment generating

989
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,559
functions,

990
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:26,319
then those distributions

991
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,559
are equal for the two random variables.

992
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,240
So we have identical distributions if

993
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:35,280
their moment generating functions are

994
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:37,920
equal. And if we consider a sequence of

995
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:42,799
random variables

996
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:44,960
and the moment generating functions

997
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,520
that can be thought of as a sequence

998
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,359
converges to

999
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,200
a function that's a moment generating

1000
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:56,079
function of some distribution. then we

1001
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,000
have that the sequence of random

1002
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,400
variables x's converges to that

1003
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
distribution as well.

1004
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:09,040
So, so these are nice properties that

1005
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:12,000
allow us to understand uh limits of

1006
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,880
random variables and what the

1007
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,119
distributions are of limits.

1008
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,280
Now with moment generating functions um

1009
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,880
the uh

1010
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,520
this

1011
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,920
slide here discusses

1012
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,240
um well it introduces you to the moment

1013
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,720
generating function for the normal

1014
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:38,240
distribution with mean mu and variance

1015
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:42,880
sigma squared and with the special case

1016
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:45,880
of mu equals zero and sigma equaling

1017
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,880
one.

1018
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:53,440
Let's see. For a normal 01,

1019
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,520
if we look at the expected value of e to

1020
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,880
the tx,

1021
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,640
okay, it's equal to the integral of e to

1022
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:06,480
the tx

1023
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:09,280
time e to the - one2 x^2

1024
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,799
over <unk>2 pi

1025
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:16,319
dx.

1026
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:22,079
So this is simply the formula for

1027
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:24,960
e to the t z I guess. Okay. Um well if

1028
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:28,240
we look at this

1029
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,640
exponential here we can write this as e

1030
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:34,640
to the - one2

1031
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:37,640
um x minus

1032
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,640
uh

1033
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,480
let's see

1034
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:48,280
xus

1035
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,280
uh t / 2

1036
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,799
squared

1037
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:55,799
That gives us x^2

1038
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,799
minus

1039
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,520
oh no just x - t ^2

1040
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,000
is this right?

1041
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,200
Let's see. Okay. I basically want to

1042
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,359
take 12 x^

1043
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,200
squared

1044
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,040
uh

1045
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,640
minus

1046
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:28,079
or sorry plus TX

1047
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:32,880
and write this as min - one2 of uh

1048
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:35,880
X - T squared

1049
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,880
minus

1050
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:43,839
T ^2 over two.

1051
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,400
Is that right? All right. I want a plus

1052
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:50,319
right there.

1053
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:53,839
So, so this exponent

1054
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:57,680
of the exponential here can be rewritten

1055
01:00:53,839 --> 01:01:02,359
as this exponent times that. So this so

1056
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,359
this is equal to um

1057
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,400
so this is equal to the integral from

1058
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:17,240
minus infinity to infinity 1 over <unk>2

1059
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:17,240
pi e - 12 x - t^2

1060
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:28,400
and then plus t ^2 / 2 dx.

1061
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:31,400
And so this exponential factor with t^

1062
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,400
squ

1063
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,520
um can be taken out and this integral

1064
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,440
here is simply going to equal one.

1065
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,240
So we are able to find the moment

1066
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,200
generating function for the standard

1067
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:50,640
normal very easily

1068
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:54,400
is equal to e to the half t ^2. Now if

1069
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:57,119
we think about transforming a random

1070
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,880
variable such as

1071
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,839
X

1072
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:05,760
with a linear function basically rescale

1073
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:08,559
X by sigma and add a mu

1074
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:13,119
then the moment generating function of

1075
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:15,200
that transformation of X to Y can be

1076
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:18,640
written out and it's equal to the

1077
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:21,119
exponential of T mu times the moment

1078
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:26,160
generating function of x evaluated at t

1079
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:29,280
sigma instead. So knowing what

1080
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:31,040
the x moment generating function is we

1081
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:35,359
basically get this function coming out

1082
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:39,760
for the u moment generating function of

1083
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:42,720
a normal. Now this uh moment generating

1084
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:48,160
function

1085
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:53,359
is in fact the moment the the expected

1086
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:56,559
value of a logn normal random variable.

1087
01:02:53,359 --> 01:03:00,000
Um at least if we set t equal to one

1088
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:04,160
it's the expected value of a logn

1089
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,280
normal. And if we take t equal to two,

1090
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:09,760
it's equal to the square

1091
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:12,799
of a logn normal distribution. So we can

1092
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,559
use the moments generating function for

1093
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,440
the normal to calculate moments of a

1094
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:21,680
logn normal distribution and that'll be

1095
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:25,680
an exercise in the next homework.

1096
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:28,720
Um okay.

1097
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:31,720
All right. So linear transformations.

1098
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,720
Um

1099
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,680
basically linear transformations

1100
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,359
don't change uh the sort of skewess of

1101
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,880
distributions.

1102
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:44,880
Um and the curtosis

1103
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,680
um can

1104
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,880
uh well it might affect the curtosis.

1105
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,880
All right. Well, let's move on to

1106
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,839
considerations of more than one random

1107
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:59,559
variable and the concept of two random

1108
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,559
variables being independent.

1109
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:05,440
In probability theory, we say two random

1110
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:07,359
variables are independent if the joint

1111
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,079
probability

1112
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:12,640
of

1113
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,559
the random variables

1114
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,599
a set

1115
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:21,760
X lying in a set A and Y lying in a set

1116
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:25,039
B. if that joint probability of both

1117
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:28,160
occurring is equal to just the product

1118
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:31,599
of each occurring alone.

1119
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:35,599
And so we have

1120
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:38,319
for uh densities or probability mass

1121
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,520
functions we have this property of the

1122
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:44,799
joint density function factoring into

1123
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,520
the product of the marginal densities of

1124
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:50,400
each of the random variables.

1125
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:53,520
And it works for continuous or uh

1126
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,440
discrete distributions as well. So

1127
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:59,119
independence

1128
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:01,760
means that uh basically knowing one

1129
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:05,280
variable doesn't give us any insight on

1130
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:09,760
the value of the other variable. Now uh

1131
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:12,400
we can compute co-variances between two

1132
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,960
random variables

1133
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:19,359
and correlations.

1134
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:22,160
And so um with a co-variance

1135
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:24,880
uh

1136
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,359
with a co-variance between two random

1137
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,839
variables.

1138
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:33,680
Um this is a generalization of the

1139
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,640
variance for one variable. But this is

1140
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:41,520
the probability weighted average of x

1141
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:45,960
minus I'll write here mux

1142
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,960
time y - muy

1143
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:52,880
and

1144
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:58,039
the correlation statistic

1145
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:58,039
corresponds to dividing

1146
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:08,559
dividing this co-variance

1147
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:12,400
by the product of sigma x and sigma y

1148
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:16,559
the square root of the variances.

1149
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:20,720
And um it turns out that this is also

1150
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:26,400
can be written as sort of x - mux over

1151
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:29,359
sigma x times y - muy

1152
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:32,400
over sigma y.

1153
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:34,880
And so the standardization of the random

1154
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,920
variables to have mean zero and standard

1155
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,079
deviation one

1156
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,119
can be

1157
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,119
made and then the expected product of

1158
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,240
those standardized values is the

1159
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:51,760
correlation statistic or the correlation

1160
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,720
parameter. Um,

1161
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,799
importantly,

1162
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,720
zero correlation doesn't imply

1163
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:02,720
independence,

1164
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:07,200
but zero correlation uh does mean that

1165
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:10,079
there's uh that that the dependence

1166
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:13,359
um does suggest that there's no linear

1167
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:16,319
dependence uh between the two variables.

1168
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:20,000
Now when we consider generalizing from

1169
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:23,680
two random variables to many then we can

1170
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:29,599
think of working with random vectors

1171
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:34,559
and with say little n being the count of

1172
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:37,680
different random variables. Um we can

1173
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:41,280
have notation of mu.j for the means or

1174
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:44,559
expectations of each and sigma j

1175
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:48,720
corresponding to the co-variance between

1176
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:52,160
x i and xj for sigma j.

1177
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:55,200
And we can then represent sort of the

1178
01:07:52,160 --> 01:08:00,079
expected vector

1179
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:02,640
of x values is equal to a mu vector. And

1180
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:06,319
we can represent the co-variances

1181
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:09,359
between elements in terms of an n byn

1182
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:13,920
matrix sigma.

1183
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:18,000
And so what's important to realize here

1184
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:21,799
is that if we have

1185
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,799
um an x vector

1186
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,719
and a mu vector. So x is equal to x1

1187
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:34,319
down to xn

1188
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:38,359
and mu is equal to mu1

1189
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,359
down to mu n.

1190
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,880
Then

1191
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:48,799
we define the co-variance matrix of X

1192
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:53,199
to be the expected value of

1193
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:57,279
sort of X minus the mu vector times X

1194
01:08:53,199 --> 01:09:01,279
minus the mu vector transpose. And so

1195
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:05,440
this is an N by one this is a 1 by N

1196
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:08,880
transpose. And so we get an n byn

1197
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:12,000
matrix where we take expectations

1198
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:16,719
element by element in that array.

1199
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,600
So um so this is a nice way of

1200
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:21,199
representing the coariance matrix.

1201
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,799
And

1202
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:27,920
what's useful in particular is well if

1203
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:31,120
we think of X's maybe representing

1204
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:34,799
returns on different assets

1205
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:37,920
with means meu and the covariance matrix

1206
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:40,719
tells us how much variability there is

1207
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:44,880
in each of the xis but also the

1208
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:51,600
correlation structure across the n uh

1209
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:55,600
x's. Then um if we consider say a linear

1210
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,320
combination of the x's given by a vector

1211
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,080
a of constants

1212
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:07,199
then this linear combination of the x's

1213
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:10,960
can actually represent maybe a portfolio

1214
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:14,080
of holdings across different assets

1215
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:18,480
given by the x size. And what we'd like

1216
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:21,920
to be able to do is model the mean

1217
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:25,840
value of Y and its variance. The mean

1218
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:29,040
value is very simply the linear

1219
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:32,800
combination of the component means times

1220
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,920
the A coefficients. And when we go to

1221
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,400
calculate the variance of Y, if you go

1222
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:41,360
through each step here and each equation

1223
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:44,080
here is doing something slightly

1224
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,960
important. um you know we're basically

1225
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,960
substituting in a transpose x for y at

1226
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:54,080
the beginning and arpose mu for the

1227
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:59,280
expected value. Then we are able to pull

1228
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:01,679
out the constant vector a transpose in

1229
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:04,719
the front of the expectation and

1230
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:07,840
actually in the back of the expectation.

1231
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:11,040
So these coefficient vectors are

1232
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:14,000
constants and can be pulled out of the

1233
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:16,320
expectation computations. And then this

1234
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,880
middle term here is simply the coariance

1235
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:24,560
matrix of x. So we have that the

1236
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:27,280
variance of y is simply the sum

1237
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:30,880
double sum over all pairs of

1238
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:35,120
coefficients a i a j multiplied by the

1239
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:38,480
covariance terms between i and j. So

1240
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:40,159
this is the formula for the variance of

1241
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,679
y.

1242
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:44,679
um something that's

1243
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,760
let's see I'm not sure if we go into

1244
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:56,400
this in the next slide but um

1245
01:11:51,760 --> 01:12:00,000
if the co-variance of x i and xj is

1246
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:05,280
equal to zero so if this is equal to

1247
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:09,760
zero for all i not equal to j then this

1248
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:16,360
variance expression simplifies a

1249
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,360
And um if say a I ji

1250
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:24,280
um is equal to a j is equal to 1 / n

1251
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:29,280
then

1252
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:33,040
um

1253
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:35,520
the uh sum of the ais

1254
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:38,080
is equal to one

1255
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,400
and the sum of the ai

1256
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:44,040
squares

1257
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,040
is equal to

1258
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,880
what?

1259
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,679
No, no. This this is not this this is

1260
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,840
not equal to one. It's going to be less

1261
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,840
than one.

1262
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:09,679
>> One over n, right? It's it's n

1263
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:13,199
* 1 / n.

1264
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:16,400
So it's sorry n * 1 / n^2.

1265
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:18,640
So the variance of sort of an equal

1266
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,679
weighted

1267
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:25,840
average of the x's

1268
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:28,400
will have variance that's 1 / n times

1269
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,040
the variance of each of the x's. So this

1270
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,640
is where sort of diversification

1271
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,719
can be useful in terms of reducing

1272
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,640
variability

1273
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:44,320
and uh in the very special case where we

1274
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:48,560
have say zero correlated assets

1275
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:51,840
um and uh

1276
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:56,560
I guess equal weighted variances of the

1277
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:58,080
ass of the x's um then we can reduce the

1278
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,679
uh variability

1279
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,280
by

1280
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:05,840
the factor n one or multiplying by the

1281
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:11,840
factor 1 / n.

1282
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:14,000
Okay. Um well this leads us to uh

1283
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,760
introducing you to principal components

1284
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,640
analysis.

1285
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:22,960
Um and

1286
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:25,120
with principal components analysis

1287
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,840
um

1288
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,360
let's see

1289
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,960
we

1290
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:36,080
consider

1291
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:39,080
sort of an mv variant vector x

1292
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,080
um

1293
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:49,520
so we consider an x vector that's m by

1294
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:51,840
one which has an expected value

1295
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:55,560
equal to

1296
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,560
an alpha vector

1297
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,679
and a covariance matrix

1298
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:08,560
which is M by M equal to sigma

1299
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,159
matrix

1300
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:15,679
and

1301
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:18,560
this coariance matrix is a real matrix.

1302
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:22,080
that is symmetric.

1303
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,760
Therefore, it's going to have real

1304
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,000
values

1305
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:29,679
and

1306
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,120
it's also going to have

1307
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,880
non- negative igen values

1308
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:38,960
because

1309
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:41,520
the coariance matrix is positive

1310
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:46,320
semidefinite.

1311
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:48,880
And so um so sigma

1312
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:51,880
is positive

1313
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,880
semidefinite.

1314
01:15:52,239 --> 01:16:00,199
The definition of positive semidefinite

1315
01:15:54,719 --> 01:16:00,199
is that for all a vectors

1316
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:08,679
um a transpose sigma a is greater than

1317
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,679
or equal to zero.

1318
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:15,920
And

1319
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:20,040
this is actually the variance of a

1320
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,040
transpose X.

1321
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,199
This

1322
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:30,800
product of the coarience matrix times

1323
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:33,840
the transpose of an A vector that. So,

1324
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:37,520
so the fact that the variance

1325
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:42,159
of the linear combination of

1326
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:46,320
the x's is strictly non- negative gives

1327
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:50,159
us this result here which means that the

1328
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:52,320
sigma matrix is positive semidefinite

1329
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:56,800
and uh

1330
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:59,600
we um let's see we can basically list

1331
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,480
the ien values to be lambda one through

1332
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:07,040
lambda to m those could be all

1333
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:11,520
different. Um some of them will be non

1334
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:16,480
zero so long as there's no uh so long as

1335
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:21,040
the coariance matrix is uh um sort of

1336
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:24,640
has some positive rank. And so with this

1337
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:29,679
framework where we have um the

1338
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:33,600
co-variance matrix sigma having values

1339
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:37,280
lambda i and corresponding igen vectors

1340
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:39,120
gamma subi. Um

1341
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,679
we can

1342
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:45,120
well we can normalize the igen vectors

1343
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:48,159
gamma i to be

1344
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:51,120
of unit length.

1345
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:54,880
So gamma transpose gamma i is equal to

1346
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:58,800
one and we can also define the gamas to

1347
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:02,719
be uh orthogonal to each other.

1348
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:05,520
Then uh principal components

1349
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,920
defines new variables

1350
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:12,159
by saying

1351
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:17,520
um we take our vector x

1352
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:19,679
we transpose it to x minus alpha. So

1353
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:23,520
we're looking at deviations from the

1354
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:26,320
mean values component by component and

1355
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:30,159
then we

1356
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:32,560
take each of those and

1357
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:34,719
we

1358
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:38,960
multiply them

1359
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:42,679
or look at the dotproduct of gamma i dox

1360
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,679
minus alpha

1361
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,800
and we call this um

1362
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:54,159
the coefficient

1363
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:57,679
of the E principal component variables.

1364
01:18:54,159 --> 01:19:03,480
And these principal component variables

1365
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:03,480
are very neat because

1366
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:11,800
their average or mean value is equal to

1367
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,800
zero.

1368
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:20,000
But the covariance matrix between the PS

1369
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:23,840
is um

1370
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,440
it's time to finish the lecture here.

1371
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:29,520
Um

1372
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:33,040
the uh covariance matrix is the diagonal

1373
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:39,080
uh matrix lambda. So we basically have

1374
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,080
transformed our original X vector

1375
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:46,960
into

1376
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:49,840
new coordinates which have mean zero

1377
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,400
are uncorrelated with each other and

1378
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:55,679
have variability that

1379
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:59,679
decreases basically with I. If we rank

1380
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:04,159
the the principal components uh en

1381
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:06,000
vectors lambda one to be bigger than or

1382
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:09,520
basically to be ordered from lambda one

1383
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:13,920
to lambda m. So we have uh an orthogonal

1384
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:16,960
basis for our data in this case. And um

1385
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:19,679
let's see. I guess we'll finish there

1386
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:23,679
for today, but on Thursday we'll finish

1387
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:28,239
these notes up. And uh what you'll be

1388
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:29,920
able to see is how we can try to

1389
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:32,239
represent

1390
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,400
an x vector

1391
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:40,640
as a sum of terms. and maybe the sum of

1392
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:42,159
terms corresponds to using just a small

1393
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:45,440
number of the principal component

1394
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:48,080
variables. So when we have

1395
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:52,400
multi-dimensional vectors that have

1396
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:54,560
variability that is limited to a smaller

1397
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,880
number of dimensions, we can

1398
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:59,120
characterize those smaller number of

1399
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:04,080
dimensions nicely with principal

1400
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:07,120
components and obtain uh useful models.

1401
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:11,120
And these kinds of models underly

1402
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:13,199
multiffactor models often in doing uh uh

1403
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:16,080
modeling asset returns and financial

1404
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:21,000
markets. So we'll finish there for today

1405
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:21,000
and uh thank you.
