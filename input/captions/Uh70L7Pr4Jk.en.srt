1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,400
okay good

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,920
morning

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,039
so we started talking about

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,039
multicomponent systems

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,280
mixtures and our program is

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,120
that at the beginning we try to see when

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,840
it is possible to

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,960
infer the properties of the mixture as

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,760
much as

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:49,600
possible from the properties of the pure

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,920
components and so we we are in the

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,079
process of defining some ideal

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,719
situations in which this is

14
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,160
possible which as we said is a good

15
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,840
start

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,360
in our modeling

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,000
efforts it's like a

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,560
reference simple situation in which uh

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,720
we do not to need to

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,159
add experimental uh uh

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,240
data to model our

22
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,640
mixtures but then we will find that in

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,759
practice uh the ideal situation is

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:33,079
really only a a limiting situation which

25
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:37,360
is not fulfilled by any U uh real

26
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,360
mixture ex except in some

27
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,320
limits

28
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,520
nevertheless

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,320
uh we gain a lot of information by just

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,960
looking at ideal situations

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,200
so

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,000
uh we have um defined these partial

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,960
properties that

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,600
are derivatives of

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,600
functions of the chemical

36
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,280
potentials for

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,160
example this the partial entropy of the

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,640
constituent in the mixture which is a

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,400
function of of TP and why we will uh

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,800
have to be careful uh in distinguishing

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,000
well uh between the partial entropy of

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,160
constituent in the mixture and the s

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,400
double I TP which is going to be which

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,959
is uh the

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,920
specific uh property the specific

46
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,480
entropy of pure component I when at the

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,360
same temperature and pressure of the

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:53,280
mixture we will see that uh they are

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,280
somehow related and the difference is

50
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,239
measurable so we have to pay a lot of

51
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,120
attention to the subscripts like so

52
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:06,080
single sub subrip is a partial property

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,360
for the mixture double subscrip is

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,720
specific property of the pure

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,120
component and then we Define the partial

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,159
volume which is another derivative of

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,200
the chemical potential once we know the

58
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,680
chemical potentials as function of

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,599
temperature pressure and

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,040
composition we Define the partial energy

61
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:32,519
and also we Define the partial enthalpy

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:35,480
and let me just uh stress this one uh if

63
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,519
you have the expression for the chemical

64
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,400
potential and you divide it by the

65
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,040
temperature and take the derivative not

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
with respect to T but with respect to

67
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,080
the inverse of the

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:52,079
temperature then you get the the partial

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:56,920
enthalpy this formula will come out uh a

70
00:03:52,079 --> 00:04:00,200
while often and uh also this one which I

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,560
better uh write here

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,560
on the

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,799
board we can write it this

74
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
way

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,079
okay so we can say that uh we can see

76
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:21,560
that the from this relation here we can

77
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,040
see that chemical potential can be of

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,720
the component in the

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,560
mixture can be written as this linear

80
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,759
combination enthalpy minus TS which

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,320
essentially is also equal to the gibbsa

82
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:40,560
free energy so this is also equal

83
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:44,000
to the uh partial gives a free

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,639
energy uh and

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,600
U and in fact the the derivative of G

86
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,680
with respect to ni with

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,680
at fixed T and P and the other

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,680
constituents

89
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
that's the definition of the chemical

90
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,800
potential in terms of the Gibs free

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,800
energy but it's also you could also call

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,280
it by analogy with these definitions the

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,639
partial Gibs free energy of the

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,320
constituent in the mixture so in other

95
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,120
words we're saying that the chemical

96
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,000
potential can be interpreted itself as a

97
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,560
partial property it's the partial gives

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,560
free energy of the constituent in the

99
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,120
mixture and the reason why we call these

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,560
properties

101
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,560
partial is because they

102
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,000
contribute

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,639
um to the pro to building up the

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,120
property

105
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,520
of of the mixture by simple

106
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,520
multiplication with their

107
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,560
amounts and each and you can do this for

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,240
entropy volume uh energy the free

109
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,960
energies the

110
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,160
enthalpy they all they all have the same

111
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,160
uh

112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,080
structure of course now we we uh forget

113
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,960
uh the small systems and we focus on

114
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,520
large systems so this is the the right

115
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,840
hand side the highlighted formulas

116
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,720
because for smaller for small systems we

117
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,160
would have also to some contributions

118
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:31,560
that correct uh this expression in terms

119
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,560
of the oiler free energy

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,319
okay so

121
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:43,840
how do we

122
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,639
measure these partial

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,639
properties and here's a set

124
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,360
up we take a mixture with a given

125
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,199
composition in stable equilibrium of

126
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,759
course we the I don't not repeating it

127
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,800
uh uh often enough but we're still um we

128
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,919
are concentrating our attention out on

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,400
the stable equilibrium

130
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:17,160
State and so we take a mixture with some

131
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,680
given composition at a stable

132
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,039
equilibrium State at temperature and

133
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,039
pressure

134
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,039
p and

135
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,479
uh the we put it in in mutual

136
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,039
equilibrium with the thermal

137
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,919
reservoir of the kind that can

138
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,560
exchange uh also volume so you have also

139
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,840
the pressure equality as a condition for

140
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Mutual equilibrium between your mixture

141
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,120
and the

142
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,639
reservoir then we take a little

143
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,639
bit of pure component

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,440
I and we add it to the mixture and we

145
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,240
wait until the mix

146
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,080
goes

147
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,039
again to Mutual equilibrium with that

148
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,039
thermal

149
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:14,440
reservo okay so this is a mixing

150
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,240
process in which we add a small amount

151
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,240
of one of the

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,080
components and then since we can measure

153
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,080
properties of

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,879
systems for example let me take the

155
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,560
enthalpy and so let me measure the

156
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,080
difference between the

157
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,120
enthalpy

158
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,440
of the

159
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,159
mixture in this final

160
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,800
State and the enthalpy of the composite

161
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,320
system of the mixture plus the pure

162
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,160
component in the initial

163
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,800
State okay so this is for the mixture in

164
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,720
the final State the amounts are the same

165
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,800
but the amount for the constituent are I

166
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,240
is n plus

167
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,120
DN this is the

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,880
initial where in the mixture I just have

169
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,120
ni I and the dni is separate from the

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,160
mixture so it

171
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,480
contributes uh with its

172
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:22,120
own uh to the enthalpy of the the pure

173
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,320
uh constituent through its specific

174
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,040
property of the pure component and

175
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,360
notice that

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,279
usually as I said several times enthalpy

177
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,800
is not an additive property but if

178
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,360
you're looking

179
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,720
at um systems that are at the same

180
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,399
temper pressure then enthalpy is an

181
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,720
additive and therefore the enthalpy of

182
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,279
the composite of these two subsystems is

183
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,880
equal to the sum of the two enthalpies

184
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,640
like we do here the sum of the enthalpy

185
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,600
of the mixture plus the enthalpy of the

186
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,320
pure

187
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,320
component okay

188
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,160
now if we take this and divide it by the

189
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,720
amount of u constituent I I that we have

190
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,720
um added to the

191
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,839
mixture that

192
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,880
defines the

193
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,680
change in the enthalpy due to the

194
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,920
addition

195
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,760
of that amount of of a small amount of

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,200
the

197
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,640
component and of course DN is supposed

198
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,640
to be small so we're taking the limit of

199
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,959
these which

200
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,000
is which can be viewed as an incremental

201
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,440
product at least the part with the

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,839
capital

203
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,440
H it's a partial derivative of Capital H

204
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,160
with respect to ni and then there is

205
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,360
this additional contribution of the

206
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,839
separate pure component that we have

207
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,480
added which uh since I divided I'm

208
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,959
dividing by D

209
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:00,160
ni uh adds but with a minus sign a

210
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,880
contribution here now now we recognize

211
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,040
that this derivative is exactly what we

212
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,000
defined as the partial

213
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,200
enthalpy of the constituent in the

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,760
mixture in the previous slide so here we

215
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,760
have the difference between the partial

216
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,360
enthalpy and the specific enthalpy of

217
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,560
pure component at the same T and P of

218
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,839
the

219
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,600
mixture this is what we call the

220
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,560
enthalpy of isotherm baric

221
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,519
mixing TP stand for

222
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,160
ISO isothermal and isobaric because we

223
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:41,160
are doing this uh in uh a fixed tnp

224
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,160
imposed by the

225
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,000
reservoir this can be

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,920
measured

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,320
enthalpy in a process like this is

228
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,639
essentially uh if you make the energy

229
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:03,079
balance this is essentially the U the

230
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:07,320
heat exchange with the uh thermal

231
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,320
Reservoir so you measure it with a

232
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,160
calorimeter

233
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,920
so that means that since you can measure

234
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,399
this with a calorimeter and you know the

235
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,600
properties of pure substances then you

236
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,240
have measured the partial enthalpy of

237
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,440
the component in the mixture and this

238
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,040
doesn't require any particular uh

239
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,560
assumptions uh about the mixture being

240
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,760
ideal or non ideal we actually haven't

241
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,320
even defined yet what ideal

242
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,519
means it's simply a tool a method with

243
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,320
which people

244
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:47,600
measure properties of of of

245
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,320
mixtures and what we have done here for

246
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,880
the enthalpy can be repeated U the same

247
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,279
way so uh I'm not repeating it here but

248
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
uh to

249
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,120
Define uh

250
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,160
the volume of

251
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,959
mixing so it's the difference between

252
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,760
the partial volume and the specific

253
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,680
volume at the same tnp the energy of

254
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,680
mixing and the entropy of

255
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,000
mixing and these are all things that you

256
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,000
can measure by energy and entropy

257
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,279
balances so these are ways in which you

258
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:34,639
can characterize okay this is is a oops

259
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,440
sorry yeah there is a an

260
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,279
extra

261
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,639
uh character there

262
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:46,959
okay all right so now let's peruse that

263
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
equation which I've written up there on

264
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,560
the

265
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,560
board and

266
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:59,040
substitute the expression of the uh

267
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
partial enthalpy

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,959
as uh hii so the specific enthalpy of

269
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,639
the pure component times the enthalpy of

270
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:14,800
mixing and the same for the entropy s

271
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,839
partial we can write it as s specific of

272
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:22,680
the pure

273
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,680
component times the entropy of isobaric

274
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:31,040
mixing all right so then we recognize

275
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,040
that also for the pure substance

276
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:39,120
um H minus TS is the chemical

277
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:43,079
potential so this gives us a

278
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,920
relation for the chemical potential the

279
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,880
component in the mixture in terms of the

280
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,759
chemical potential of the pure component

281
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,800
at the same temperature and pressure of

282
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,880
the mixture

283
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,519
plus the enthalpy of mixing minus t *

284
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,519
the entropy of

285
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,160
mixing and at this stage we should also

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,360
remember that by the definition of

287
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,000
partial pressures of components in a

288
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,160
mixture you

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,680
recall that that is defined by the

290
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:20,160
condition of mutual equilibrium across a

291
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,720
membrane permeable only to constituent I

292
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,279
so at that Mutual equilibrium across the

293
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,800
membrane you have a quality of chemical

294
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,959
potentials so the chemical potential of

295
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,839
a constituent in the mixture is also

296
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,120
equal to the chemical potential and here

297
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,000
there is also another mistake this

298
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,920
should be a double

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,880
I this is the chemical potential of the

300
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:48,040
pure component on the other side of the

301
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,040
um um semi- perable

302
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,440
membrane uh and therefore yes at the

303
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,079
same temperature of the mixture but at

304
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,920
the pressure which

305
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,920
is what we call the partial pressure

306
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:14,440
okay so again here I cut and paste makes

307
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:18,000
uh uh errors propagate so this should be

308
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:24,199
double I and double I okay

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,199
so the we're now taking this last

310
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,199
equality and putting in evidence the

311
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:33,360
difference and so taking a essentially

312
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:37,360
uh this term to the right hand

313
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,600
side so I have the chemical potential uh

314
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,839
the difference evaluated between

315
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,360
pressure the partial pressure and the

316
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,560
pressure of the

317
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,560
mixture pii minus

318
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:56,279
P now

319
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:01,440
here we have

320
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:04,720
already proved in a in a previous uh

321
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,839
slide maybe we we can just remind

322
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:16,400
ourselves of how we got here um that

323
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:18,400
um so we are having that uble I Pi I I

324
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:26,919
I'm sorry at the

325
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:26,919
T and p i i minus new double I

326
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:37,360
TP okay you see

327
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,360
um if I have a function of uh

328
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,200
X and the difference of a function

329
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,880
evaluated at two different points I can

330
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:53,200
always write by the integral calculus uh

331
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:56,919
equation that this is equal to the

332
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:01,039
integral from X2 to

333
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:03,960
X1 of the D derivative of that function

334
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,960
let's call it

335
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,960
um and this x Prime is a dami variable

336
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,480
of

337
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,039
integration okay so this you can write

338
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,520
for any for any function so

339
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,080
here we apply this

340
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:27,280
theorem so uh this x X2 is

341
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,159
p X1 is P1 I

342
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,559
I and the dtive we the derivative we

343
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,880
have to put here is the partial

344
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,880
derivative with respect to

345
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,120
P of what of the chemical potential of

346
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,440
the pure

347
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,320
component while the other variables are

348
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,440
TP I'm sorry

349
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,440
t uh and this is to

350
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,120
be

351
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,600
evaluated at at the the vales the value

352
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:07,080
of the dami variable so pble

353
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,159
Prime and integrated over the dami

354
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:14,120
variable

355
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:16,080
but if you look up uh the many equations

356
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,440
that we have derived also for the for

357
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,799
the pure

358
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,600
substance this

359
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:29,919
derivative is the specific

360
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,919
volume okay so this becomes

361
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,080
the specific

362
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,520
volume of the pure component evaluated

363
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,640
at temperature T and at the dami

364
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,320
pressure p of integration pble

365
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Prime

366
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:50,960
okay all right so

367
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,960
that explains this integral

368
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,679
here but above we we've seen that this

369
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,520
difference in chemical potentials is

370
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:03,640
equal to the um

371
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,280
uh Delta H mix minus TS Delta s

372
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,679
mix

373
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,679
okay now look at U look at

374
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,720
this um volume

375
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:23,720
if if I have a an ideal

376
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,880
gas if I if I can uh if my substance I

377
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,000
behaves according to the ideal gas

378
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,880
relation uh the specific volume can be

379
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,280
written as

380
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,280
RT over p and the pressure that we

381
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,760
should evaluate is

382
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:46,960
P that is here so it's p double

383
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,960
Prime and so when I do this

384
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:54,440
integral uh RT goes outside because I'm

385
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,640
integrating over P pble Prime and the

386
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:02,880
integral of of uh 1 / p is the logarithm

387
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,799
so that gives me the formula uh

388
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,400
RT log

389
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:13,880
of p i i over

390
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,880
p and that's for the

391
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,279
gas if

392
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,120
instead I have a

393
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,240
liquid and I can use the

394
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:29,520
incompressible liquid

395
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,400
model for which the specific volume v I

396
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,000
I is

397
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,679
approximately

398
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,799
constant meaning independent of

399
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,080
temperature and

400
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:43,480
pressure well if it is a constant it

401
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:50,279
goes out of the integral and then this

402
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:53,039
becomes uh the specific volume times p i

403
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,840
i minus

404
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,559
p and here in the

405
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,640
slide I just switched

406
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,080
uh

407
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,320
because the pressure usually greater

408
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,000
than the partial pressure so I um put

409
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,559
this difference in parenthesis and then

410
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,120
I pick up a minus sign on the other side

411
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:16,440
okay so this formula will be

412
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,760
useful

413
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,760
in in a

414
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,240
moment and

415
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,520
again we see that there is a relation

416
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,520
between the partial

417
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,760
pressures very expit explicit

418
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:39,440
relations in

419
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,720
terms of the enthalpy and the entropies

420
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,760
of isobaric

421
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,480
mixing so this is a way in which you can

422
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,279
measure partial

423
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,760
pressures because you can measure the

424
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,760
properties of isothermic mixing

425
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:10,440
for example

426
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:13,000
here uh I want to sort of point you

427
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:18,200
to a couple of

428
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,960
references which if you go and take a

429
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,360
look un Veil

430
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,120
um uh a

431
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,240
huge uh

432
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,159
literature uh so a huge um community

433
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,919
that

434
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:41,200
over uh many decades or perhaps uh over

435
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,559
more than a than a century have been

436
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,120
measuring properties this

437
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:50,919
way and they're still doing it because

438
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,919
the applications uh are

439
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,200
growing for example this is a

440
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:03,120
um an experimental paper where they

441
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:08,400
collect uh uh they measure the enthalpy

442
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,679
of isothermic mixing of liquids and

443
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,960
these liquids

444
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:18,120
are molten

445
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,480
salts that as you may know uh are used

446
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,320
in various

447
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,880
applications

448
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,559
including solar thermal

449
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,120
applications in in those uh

450
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:36,440
collectors with

451
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:39,960
mirrors that want to achieve high

452
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,760
temperatures the molten Souls

453
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:47,480
allow are stable also at very high

454
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,960
temperatures and therefore using this

455
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,960
um these

456
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,600
um

457
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,799
fluids you

458
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,320
can collect solar energy at high

459
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:02,320
temperatures up to maybe 600

460
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,480
Celsius but of course uh molten souls

461
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,279
are used also in nuclear uh engineering

462
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,279
and in

463
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,520
uh processing Industries

464
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,120
for producing uh materials that are

465
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:29,399
useful for um all sorts of applications

466
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,360
from Electronics to to

467
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:36,080
to

468
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,840
magnets okay so this is for so this is a

469
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,760
reference in which you can see how

470
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,679
people uh measure and and then try to

471
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,240
correlate so there is also a number of

472
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,320
correlations which go under the names of

473
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,320
the inventors of the

474
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,080
correlations that do good jobs in uh

475
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,320
determining

476
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:07,080
uh these effects you see

477
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:13,440
here the gray molecule

478
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:16,760
seum uh ion is um is sort of the the

479
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:21,399
solvent is like the the prevailing or

480
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:24,399
the common U the common substance of

481
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:29,600
these uh mixtures and then you they keep

482
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:29,600
changing uh the other substance

483
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,120
so

484
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,000
um it's actually not only for dilute

485
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:46,679
it's for over the full range of

486
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,320
compositions from zero to one and you

487
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,520
can see that you have a

488
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:57,640
behavior in which the uh enthalpy of

489
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,640
mixing is uh negative

490
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,520
okay so

491
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,720
meaning that the

492
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,840
substance that when you mix the

493
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,039
substance the you have like an

494
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,840
exothermic reaction it's not really a

495
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:20,240
reaction but it's a physical chemical uh

496
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,520
effect which releases heat so in other

497
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,880
words you have to if you want to return

498
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,520
to Mutual equilibrium with your

499
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,640
Reservoir you have to cool down after

500
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,039
the mixing you have to cool tool down by

501
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,039
by this

502
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,840
amount and that cooling measures is is

503
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,679
exactly so with that's how you with the

504
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,880
calorimeter you can measure that uh

505
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,640
Cooling and and

506
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:53,399
therefore this Delta

507
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,080
H you can also do similar

508
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:59,000
measurements

509
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:02,600
for the volume of mixing

510
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,600
and here I sketched

511
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,200
um

512
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,679
the yeah I think this line should be

513
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:17,120
should belong a little lower here to the

514
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:21,399
zero level and I sketched uh this is

515
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:24,679
just to show that um it's the volume of

516
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:26,760
mixing is not always positive it can be

517
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,200
positive it can be

518
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,240
negative it can can

519
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,320
be positive in one range and they become

520
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,399
negative in the other range depending on

521
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,559
uh the

522
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:43,320
composition and it all depends on what

523
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:48,000
kind of molecules you have and how the

524
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,720
molecules interact with each

525
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,399
other and as you can

526
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,600
see these two reference where

527
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:59,440
you may want to take a look to to see

528
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:05,360
experimental data and how they're

529
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,360
treated date back to at least 40 years

530
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,360
ago

531
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:24,320
okay now this slide is also uh is just

532
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,320
uh parenthetical it just uh says all

533
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,320
right so we have seen that in practice

534
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,720
with those measurements you can we we

535
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,159
can infer the values of the chemical

536
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,600
potentials and therefore the partial

537
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,679
properties uh so the

538
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,960
question that we address in in this

539
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,679
slide is can

540
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,799
we is the meaning of partial that we use

541
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:56,559
in partial properties the same as the

542
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,640
meaning of partial as we use in partial

543
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,960
pressures and the answer answer is no

544
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,039
because the definition is different

545
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,640
however you can somehow somehow relate

546
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:10,000
partial properties in terms of partial

547
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:17,279
pressures and

548
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,279
here uh here's the way of of of doing it

549
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:24,720
uh it's just a matter of writing the

550
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:27,240
chemical potential as we see here uh

551
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,600
again as a function as it is of the

552
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,640
partial pressure so if you if you take

553
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,080
U the differential of this relation here

554
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,159
which defines the partial

555
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,240
pressure and then remember that the the

556
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,080
derivatives of the part of the chemical

557
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,159
potential are the partial properties

558
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,159
then that is where uh that relation

559
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,159
comes

560
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,320
about and here are the details so if you

561
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,960
like to take derivatives uh this is uh

562
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,639
how you can practice it

563
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,639
so I'm not going to

564
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,919
explain uh the details

565
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:17,639
here at this stage we need

566
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,240
to

567
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:24,480
recall something

568
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:29,919
about what happens when

569
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,919
molecules come close to one another

570
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,840
and the Leonard

571
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,840
John's

572
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:45,799
model gives you the potential energy of

573
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,760
the interaction between two molecules so

574
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:51,639
suppose I have one molecule and I stay

575
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,000
in uh and I sit on that molecule on the

576
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:56,880
reference frame that moves with that

577
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,399
molecule and I see another molecule

578
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:04,080
approaching the Leonard Jones

579
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:07,639
model is a pair interaction kind of

580
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,799
model it looks just uh what happens

581
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:14,720
between one molecule and the other not

582
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,799
the fact uh it doesn't apply well if you

583
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,639
have to consider also the fact that this

584
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,639
molecule may also at the same time be

585
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:25,080
interacting with a third and maybe a

586
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,080
fourth

587
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:32,919
molecule which of course is important in

588
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,639
liquids but okay so here's the idea I'm

589
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,120
sitting on that molecule and I see

590
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:38,120
another molecule

591
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:46,360
approaching now because of the

592
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,600
electronic U structure of atoms and

593
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,159
molecules the electrons that are

594
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,240
negatively

595
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,320
charged yes are attracted by the nucleus

596
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,559
or the nuclei of the molecule of the

597
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,440
atom

598
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,639
but as they approach other molecules

599
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,679
they're also a bit attracted by the

600
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:11,679
nucleus of the other

601
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,679
uh atom okay and that

602
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,639
produces these so-called Vander Val

603
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,519
vales attractive forces so the potential

604
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:24,559
going uh negative so if this is the

605
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,279
potential remember the I can calculate

606
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,000
the

607
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,279
force by taking the derivative of the

608
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,480
potential with respect to

609
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:41,000
distance minus sign so this force is a

610
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:44,960
vector and I is the vector that points

611
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,159
in the direction uh outward so further

612
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:54,039
from the molecule I am sitting on so

613
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:57,039
it's like on this axis I I subar is the

614
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:59,720
unit Vector in the r Direction in the uh

615
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,720
right direction

616
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,320
all right so the usefulness of having a

617
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:07,520
potential is that then you can calculate

618
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,399
forces by taking the derivative of the

619
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,359
potential and as you see here is the for

620
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,359
if the force is

621
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:23,639
negative uh it means that the the its

622
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:26,520
direction is in the opposite sign of the

623
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,800
unit Vector in the r Direction so it

624
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,480
points left so it's

625
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:37,159
attractive so and uh up to this point

626
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,159
which is about um

627
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:49,000
here the the derivative is

628
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:53,720
um the derivative of V is positive so

629
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,720
the force is negative and

630
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:03,480
uh yeah yeah okay up to up up to this

631
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,320
point where it is zero we get to the

632
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,680
minimum uh it's

633
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,079
attractive and from this point on it

634
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,480
becomes

635
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,480
repulsive the force becomes

636
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,520
positive that repulsion is due to the

637
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,560
fact that now the

638
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,400
nuclei which are positively charged

639
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,720
begin to F the positive charge of the

640
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,240
nucle of the of the particle I'm sitting

641
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,240
on and therefore that

642
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,359
repels

643
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:50,680
okay so most uh of the

644
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:54,520
times molecules are are running

645
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:58,240
around in their brunian

646
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,520
motion so uh in which they have some

647
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,280
kinetic

648
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,839
energy due to the velocity they

649
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,200
have and they have also this potential

650
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,480
energy some of that kinetic energy gets

651
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,560
transformed in potential

652
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,760
energy or actually when the molecule

653
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,480
approaches and gets an attractive force

654
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,319
it

655
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,800
gains kinetic energy so it's accelerated

656
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:29,240
towards the the particle so if this

657
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,400
molecule is coming from uh the right and

658
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,760
it's

659
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,760
approaching it's

660
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,240
accelerated towards the molecule I'm

661
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,960
sitting

662
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,640
in but

663
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,760
then uh all of a sudden it finds also

664
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:50,680
repulsive for so that's

665
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,160
deceleration of course if the kinetic if

666
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:58,480
the kinetic energy is

667
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:02,440
enough this molecule can go and hit

668
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,160
so make a collision eventually it will

669
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,319
make a collision because because the

670
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,200
force is going to become very large and

671
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:12,240
the repulsive Force becomes very large

672
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,319
and and therefore the particle is pushed

673
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,040
away back that's a collision it's like a

674
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:19,040
soft Collision but it's a

675
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:28,200
collision uh an even simpler model of

676
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,560
these would be

677
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,880
uh the so-called hard sphere

678
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:39,400
model in which the

679
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,400
potential is would be like

680
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,400
a

681
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,520
uh

682
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,200
okay okay would be like

683
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:59,000
this a function so

684
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:02,839
V is a function which goes to infinite

685
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,240
it's infinite at at this point which is

686
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,319
one it's the the distance one is because

687
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,839
we're

688
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:16,000
normalizing this to

689
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:18,599
the diameter of these molecules of these

690
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,480
spheres assuming they're

691
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,839
equal otherwise it would be like the you

692
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,839
have to normalize to the average

693
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,400
uh it's the of the radi of the two

694
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:37,240
molecules and it's zero here so the

695
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:43,520
heart sphere model assumes no attractive

696
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:48,040
Force until the sphere hits like in The

697
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,359
Bard uh bilard ball situation it hits

698
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:54,720
the other molecule and it gets uh

699
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:58,720
repelled by some elastic condition

700
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,720
elastic Collision

701
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,440
okay but let's return to this case Here

702
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,520
and Now

703
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,520
consider two important

704
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:20,200
regimes one regime is the ideal

705
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,240
gas the gas

706
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:27,520
regime so it's true that the the

707
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,359
molecules of the gas

708
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,359
very

709
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,359
often

710
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,720
uh billions of uh

711
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,880
collisions uh per second we we maybe

712
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,359
we'll have a a slide later on that does

713
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,359
that

714
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,160
calculation do have experience

715
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,880
collisions so these

716
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,040
molecules do get U uh to feel his

717
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
potential

718
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,520
when they

719
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,839
approach the other molecules and have a

720
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,040
collision that happens very

721
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:12,760
often but if you look up if you make an

722
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:16,599
average a Time average of how much

723
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:21,200
time this molecule

724
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:25,280
spans in this area where

725
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,720
the LeRon potential is is

726
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,520
negative is very small

727
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,960
most of the times on average the

728
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,839
particles are far

729
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:42,000
apart and therefore on

730
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,640
average they feel uh

731
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,160
zero

732
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,079
potential this this is why when you're

733
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,400
trying to measure the

734
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,839
properties you're actually measuring the

735
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,079
properties on

736
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:59,880
average because remember that somehow

737
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,680
the state of your system is is the is

738
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,760
the probability

739
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,640
distribution uh of things H for example

740
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,599
here it's the probability

741
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,560
distribution uh of finding finding the

742
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,880
particle at these various distances and

743
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,640
the pro that

744
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,160
probability uh for a

745
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,000
gas

746
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,800
is as a very small tail here and it

747
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,160
picks

748
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,160
away so most of the times

749
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,040
the particles are far away from each

750
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,200
other even though they experience a lot

751
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,200
of

752
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,079
collisions but that means that when

753
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,839
you're calculating the stable

754
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,640
equilibrium prop properties therefore

755
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:53,359
the average uh time average properties

756
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:57,839
uh this potential is irrelevant and that

757
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,839
is what allows you to

758
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:04,400
uh for example use the hard spere

759
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,800
model because that's totally equivalent

760
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:12,560
if the the particles live far away on

761
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,480
average uh and the details of the

762
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,599
potential of their interaction when they

763
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,559
closed is not important well uh those

764
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,200
details you can forget they don't enter

765
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:28,160
into determining the properties of of of

766
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:30,800
of the mixers so much that

767
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,839
in the ideal gas and also we'll we

768
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:39,480
hopefully have a slide also on this

769
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,480
uh the ideal

770
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,240
gas this relation here that the the

771
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,440
volume is RT over

772
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,160
P you can

773
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,440
derive for a particle a single particle

774
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,440
in a

775
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,599
box which is a a nice illustration

776
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,559
also of that's why I will have a slide

777
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,559
on this

778
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,160
uh but in other words this here in this

779
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,319
context is just to say that this the

780
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,280
properties of of of an ideal

781
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,839
gas so

782
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:22,640
the the origin of this uh ideal gas uh

783
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:26,200
equation of

784
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,440
State comes from the single particle

785
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:32,640
because the properties aable equilibrium

786
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:35,160
in this regime are are those of

787
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,480
particles that live on average by

788
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:41,200
themselves they don't feel the effects

789
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,200
of the other

790
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,240
particles there is another case also

791
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,359
which is the liquid case we'll return to

792
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,559
the liquid in in a while mean maybe

793
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,000
today but um

794
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:03,240
what's what's important is that instead

795
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,319
the liquid particles live very close to

796
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,319
one another they live near this

797
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,200
minimum so for

798
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,640
them this

799
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,640
potential is more

800
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,800
important okay

801
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,720
uh yeah this

802
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,960
um this the ler johon potential formula

803
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,480
can be written is written in two

804
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:50,480
different uh ways here one is in

805
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:53,119
terms of the actual distance and one is

806
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,200
the in terms of the distance normalized

807
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,839
to this uh

808
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,040
minimum to the to the

809
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:04,440
distance at which the minimum

810
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:09,720
occurs Sigma as I already said

811
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:14,880
is R is normalized here to Sigma so it's

812
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:16,480
one uh at the distance where um it is

813
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,720
equal to the diameter of the two

814
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,720
particles so where the particles are

815
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,839
colliding and uh here we also in the in

816
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,599
the in the plot normalized the potential

817
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:34,920
to Epsilon and

818
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:39,839
Epsilon is the depth of this

819
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,839
well here so it goes to minus

820
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,760
one so

821
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,359
stronger

822
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:52,000
interactions will have will be

823
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,000
characterized by stronger values of this

824
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:58,839
Epsilon okay

825
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,839
so with this introduction

826
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,960
let's

827
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:11,680
consider a a first ideal um Behavior

828
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,240
which is called which we will call Gibs

829
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,680
Dalton ideal

830
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:23,280
behavior and which will be a very good

831
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:25,000
approximation for gases in the gas

832
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,319
phase

833
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,440
because in practice

834
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:35,000
we will assume that not only particles

835
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:39,599
of the same kind like you would have in

836
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,760
a pure substance but also particles of

837
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:46,720
different kind like we have in a

838
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,599
mixture they also live on average far

839
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,839
away from one another and therefore we

840
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:56,640
can neglect the effect of their

841
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:56,640
intermolecular interactions

842
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,359
okay all right formally this is uh how

843
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:11,599
uh The

844
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:15,920
Story Goes we will first define ideal

845
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:18,160
behavior and just so this this will be

846
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,440
the our this will be the final result of

847
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,440
this

848
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:29,160
slide and uh the motivation is that of

849
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,920
this definition that we going to to do

850
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,920
here is that

851
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,680
we will find that under this

852
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:43,040
approximation or in this limit on this

853
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:46,599
when these uh uh assumptions are

854
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,200
valid then we obtain a famous result

855
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:52,000
which is the Dalton law of additive

856
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,319
partial pressures so the

857
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,960
pressure of the mixture is going to be

858
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:01,520
equal to the sum of the partial

859
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:04,280
pressures of the uh constituents of the

860
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,440
mixture but in general that is not true

861
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,440
not the I mean this is not true for a

862
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,440
for a non- ideal

863
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,720
mixture so the derivation goes as

864
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:21,520
follows we start from the oiler

865
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,520
relation written for the

866
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:30,119
mixture we write

867
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,119
also the oil relation for the pure

868
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,280
components and when I'm and here I'm

869
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,599
going to write it for the pure

870
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,520
components at uh just on the other side

871
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,160
of the

872
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,920
um semi permal membrane so they are in

873
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,240
at the same temperature of the mixture

874
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:53,200
but at the partial pressure okay so this

875
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,240
uble I

876
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:59,000
here uh I'm not writing the explicit

877
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,000
dependence but I'm doing it

878
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,160
here uh are eval to be

879
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,799
evaluated at T and partial

880
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:13,280
pressure then I

881
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:16,480
take these uh

882
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:20,400
individual pure constituent Oiler

883
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,440
relations we multi I multiply them

884
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,960
by the amount n i with which that

885
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,240
constituent is present in the mixture

886
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,680
and some overall

887
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,720
components and then I take the this

888
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:38,319
summation subtract it from the uh Oiler

889
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:41,520
relation for the mixture and here is the

890
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:43,799
result so you can still identify here

891
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:49,040
the the oil relation for the mixture is

892
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:51,559
given by this term this is TS minus PV

893
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,040
plus mui n

894
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:57,359
i and uh what I subtracted is the

895
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,559
summation of the N

896
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,319
with which the that are the compon the

897
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:05,240
amounts in the mixture

898
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,200
times the single component pure

899
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:14,480
component Oiler

900
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:17,280
relation U di I minus TS I I plus p i i

901
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,400
VII and

902
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,520
uh

903
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,520
plus the m

904
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,640
actually there's a mistake here because

905
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,839
this there shouldn't be a summation here

906
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,520
this is again a cut and space problem

907
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,839
this should be I hope I'll remember all

908
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:47,200
these uh things to correct in the view

909
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:51,000
graphs um yeah so for the pure component

910
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,000
there is only one and so there is no

911
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,640
summation

912
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,640
okay now

913
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:04,319
look at these uh elements of the last

914
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,000
summation they are identically zero

915
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,160
because of the condition for Mutual

916
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,119
equilibrium that the the chemical

917
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,920
potential of component I in the mixture

918
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:15,160
is equal to the chemical potential of

919
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,559
the pure component when evaluated at the

920
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,319
partial pressure so these are

921
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,680
zero and then I get a relation here

922
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:25,799
which contains the pressure and contains

923
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,680
the partial pressures because after all

924
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:31,200
what we wanted to see here is is there a

925
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,520
relation between pressure and partial

926
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,599
pressures and here is the result so I

927
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,799
put in evidence I solve this expression

928
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,880
for the total

929
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:44,920
pressure and here is how it depends on

930
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,920
the partial pressures that's all

931
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,920
over

932
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,440
however if I make these three

933
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:02,599
assumptions you see this the first

934
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,440
assumption kills these terms in

935
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,880
parenthesis the second assumption kills

936
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,079
this other

937
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:13,319
term the third assumption and note here

938
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:18,000
that this is not a

939
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:18,000
mistake here there is no sumission

940
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:27,319
sign so if this holds then we'll discuss

941
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,720
what it means but uh if this holds holds

942
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:35,200
it means that inside this summation

943
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:38,680
where every time I see n i * VI

944
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:42,200
I I can put capital

945
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,440
V which doesn't depend on I it doesn't

946
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,799
have a subscript so it goes outside of

947
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,559
the summation and and it cancels with

948
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:52,520
the V and the denominator and then what

949
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,240
I'm left with the Su with the summation

950
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,119
is just the partial pressure so I

951
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,799
finally get that the

952
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:05,200
pressure if these three assumptions are

953
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:07,559
together all uh holding

954
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,319
uh the pressure is equal to the sum of

955
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,920
the partial pressures and this is

956
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,920
Dalton's

957
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,520
law let's see how we could

958
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,520
U

959
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:31,599
interpret those conditions

960
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,599
that Define the ideal Gibs Dalton

961
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,720
Behavior essentially it says that I can

962
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,000
see the mixture or at least I can model

963
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:43,160
the properties of the

964
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
mixture as the model as a properties of

965
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:50,680
a composite

966
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,319
system in which I have the pure

967
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,160
components

968
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:58,599
leaving each one in the same volume of

969
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:01,720
the mixture so boxes of the same

970
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:07,440
size at the same

971
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:07,440
temperature and at the partial

972
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,480
pressure

973
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,480
okay then in this

974
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:19,920
conditions uh this is the specific uh

975
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,400
they have a specific energy since

976
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,960
they're pure for example this is

977
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:28,359
component say component I has a specific

978
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:32,480
energy which is u I evaluated at the T

979
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:34,960
and P because here it is at the partial

980
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,119
pressure the same for the

981
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,119
entropy and now if

982
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:41,119
I

983
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:51,920
um use the fact

984
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:51,920
that energy and entropy are additive

985
00:54:53,720 --> 00:55:02,160
properties the

986
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:02,160
energy of this one is N1 *

987
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,960
u11 and so I sum up n i time uii and

988
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,119
that gives

989
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:15,200
me the

990
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,720
properties the property of the mixture

991
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,359
so sum of N i *

992
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,799
uii so

993
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:28,240
that's this last equation is the

994
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:29,240
defining uh equation for ideal Gibs

995
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,119
Dalton

996
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:35,559
Behavior the first one here I have added

997
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:39,240
also the general expression which is

998
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:42,880
valid always which gives the property in

999
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,319
terms of the partial

1000
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,039
properties so same for the entropy so

1001
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:51,319
it's additive so I can view

1002
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:54,240
this and instead and here I I've used

1003
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:56,920
the fact that

1004
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,960
each you see here I could also write the

1005
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:03,160
specific volume of the constituent the

1006
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:07,119
partial

1007
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:08,559
pressure and the fact that it um that in

1008
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,680
the same amount of the mixture it

1009
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:15,799
occupies the same volume of the mixture

1010
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:18,319
is the sort of interpretation of this

1011
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:18,319
formula

1012
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,880
here it

1013
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:28,240
also goes

1014
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,240
together with the

1015
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,039
idea that in the in the gas limit when

1016
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,280
molecules live far apart from one

1017
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:41,799
another think in either this or the

1018
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:45,880
Leonard jnes kind of potential if if

1019
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:45,880
they're on average they live

1020
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,039
here

1021
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:56,760
uh essentially they they stay in they

1022
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:59,319
occupy the volume of the mixture if as

1023
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,720
if they were by themselves each molecule

1024
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:01,720
by

1025
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:10,720
itself and that's

1026
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,960
why we have they obey the ideal gas law

1027
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,280
which is valid for the single molecule

1028
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,280
in a

1029
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:22,200
box even if I have many box many many

1030
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,119
particles in that box but is it is as if

1031
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,880
each one uses the Box by itself it

1032
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,799
doesn't recognize on average the

1033
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,559
presence of the other even though it

1034
00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:35,480
does continuously collide with the other

1035
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:39,280
but the

1036
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:41,920
time uh that it take the that the

1037
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,359
collision and

1038
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,079
so that it lasts the time that the

1039
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:50,920
Collision lasts is very short with

1040
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:54,400
respect to the rest of the time that the

1041
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:56,520
particle moves uh freely in space before

1042
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,839
encountering the same the other uh

1043
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,839
molecule for the next

1044
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:07,039
Collision okay so that's the ideal uh

1045
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,200
Gibs Dalton

1046
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:13,640
behavior and if we apply it now uh we

1047
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,640
haven't assumed yet ideal

1048
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,839
gas so now if we in addition to those we

1049
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:22,280
also assume that

1050
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:22,280
each pure

1051
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,440
substance

1052
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,720
behaves uh as an ideal gas so it it

1053
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:35,119
obeys the equation of state of an ideal

1054
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:37,119
gas in the full range of pressures from

1055
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,760
the partial pressure to the total

1056
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,720
pressure of the

1057
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:44,280
mixture I shouldn't call it total to the

1058
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,280
pressure of the

1059
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:53,000
mixture so I can write that the equation

1060
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:55,440
of State for the gas PV equals RT uh

1061
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,039
both at the partial pressure and at the

1062
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,039
pressure of the

1063
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,440
piure then you see from assumption

1064
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:13,119
three which is this I

1065
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,400
substitute

1066
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:19,039
this and obtain this

1067
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,720
result so I obtain the partial pressure

1068
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:21,720
written this

1069
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:31,280
way now I'm using what we proved

1070
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,599
in the Gibs Dalton uh theorem about the

1071
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,559
Dalton

1072
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:39,400
law uh that the pressure of the mixer is

1073
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,240
the sum of the partial pressures so we

1074
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:45,520
take the sum of these

1075
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:47,640
ones see RT and V do not have subscripts

1076
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,720
so they go out of the summation I'm left

1077
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:55,680
with the sum of the NS which is just the

1078
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:57,839
total n of the particles in the mixture

1079
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:02,480
so here here what what do I got what do

1080
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:03,599
I get that PV equals nrt so it means

1081
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,680
that

1082
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:10,240
also the

1083
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,920
mixture behaves as an ideal gas so what

1084
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:17,079
I what we what this proves is that an

1085
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:20,799
ideal Gibs Dalton mixture of Ideal

1086
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:25,720
gases obeys the equation of state of an

1087
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,720
ideal gas so it is an ideal gas itself

1088
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:34,760
and the

1089
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:38,839
other uh important result is that if you

1090
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:41,640
extract um RT over V from here you see

1091
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:45,400
that you can write it as partial

1092
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:48,319
pressure over the amount and RT over V

1093
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,280
from here it's the pressure over the

1094
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,280
total

1095
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,119
amount so that's essentially you combine

1096
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:59,119
these

1097
01:00:54,119 --> 01:01:01,039
two and obtain that the ratio of the

1098
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:04,280
partial pressure to the total pressure

1099
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:07,039
is equal to the ratio of the uh

1100
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:09,200
individual amount with the total amount

1101
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:12,559
which is the mole

1102
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:16,839
fraction in other words the partial

1103
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:20,319
pressure is given by the mole fraction

1104
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,319
of that constituents times the

1105
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,920
pressure of the mixture

1106
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:38,760
and this relation if we put it uh in

1107
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,920
this relation that we have derived

1108
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:45,760
before so Pi I I over

1109
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:50,559
P becomes in the

1110
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,559
limit of a Gibs Dalton

1111
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:57,319
mixture that

1112
01:01:52,359 --> 01:02:00,760
is the mole fraction so this is RT

1113
01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:00,760
the logarithm of the mole

1114
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,680
fraction and this is a very important

1115
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,839
relation it gives the chemical potential

1116
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:20,799
of one constituent in in the mixture in

1117
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:23,760
terms of uh the the chemical potential

1118
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:25,559
that it has when it is a pure substance

1119
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,839
at the same temperature and pressure of

1120
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:30,160
the

1121
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,319
plus RT the

1122
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:38,240
log of its mole fraction of the mole

1123
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:38,240
fraction with which it appears in the

1124
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:47,559
mixture so it doesn't depend on other

1125
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:50,400
things of the mixture for example what

1126
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,400
are the other

1127
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:56,400
components or how many they are except

1128
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:00,480
that all

1129
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:05,319
uh we need is to know what fraction our

1130
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,319
component as occupies uh in in the

1131
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,400
mixture

1132
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:29,119
okay the first

1133
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:34,240
few lines of this slide

1134
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:38,200
are just a cut and paste from the

1135
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:42,319
previous but here we add some other

1136
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:44,440
items for example we compute the entrop

1137
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:47,720
the partial uh

1138
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,920
entropy of the component in the

1139
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:52,319
mixture which as you

1140
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:57,039
remember is this

1141
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,039
derivative it is equal to

1142
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:05,760
um the pure component

1143
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:10,319
entropy uh

1144
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:13,359
plus a term that in when we defined the

1145
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:17,559
entropy of mixing at the beginning today

1146
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:19,240
uh this is Delta SI I

1147
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:23,880
mix

1148
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:25,720
but if we since now for for this ideal

1149
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,960
gas mixture of Ideal gases we have the

1150
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,599
the expression for the chemical

1151
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,000
potential in terms

1152
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:36,920
of explicitly here taking the derivative

1153
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,839
with respect to t you see leaves just R

1154
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,000
time the log of

1155
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:45,200
Y and since there is a minus sign here

1156
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,720
this is minus r log of Y so essentially

1157
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,359
this and we'll return to this in later

1158
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:56,279
but this says that

1159
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:59,720
the uh entropy of isothermal ISO baric

1160
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:05,359
mixing of that molecule of that molecule

1161
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:05,359
is equal to minus r log of

1162
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,799
Y and this is also

1163
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:23,640
equal to the pure component

1164
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,520
entropy

1165
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:29,960
evaluated at the p

1166
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,960
I this is

1167
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:38,039
because you

1168
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,039
remember for

1169
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:47,000
um for a

1170
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:49,599
gas for an ideal

1171
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,520
gas if I

1172
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:56,720
evaluate the difference in the

1173
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:59,720
entropy at different temperature and

1174
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,720
pressure

1175
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:06,559
um okay this is equal

1176
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:10,559
to uh and and this is a perfect suppose

1177
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:16,200
it's a perfect gas uh it's T2 over

1178
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:18,039
T1 Min - R log P2 over

1179
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:24,200
P1

1180
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:29,359
so in this relation here uh we have uh

1181
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,359
s AAL ated at

1182
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:42,799
p p all right let's say

1183
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:46,000
p p

1184
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:50,760
uh Pi I I minus

1185
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,440
s evaluated at P same temperature so

1186
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:56,160
this doesn't give any contribution so

1187
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:01,599
I'm left with minus r log

1188
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:07,039
of p i i over P but that's in our limit

1189
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:08,640
of Ideal mixture is uh um is the mole

1190
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,319
fraction

1191
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,680
okay

1192
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:17,839
so hopefully what are written on the

1193
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:20,920
board is this relation here that's to

1194
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,920
justify this equal

1195
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:30,400
sign we can also compute the partial

1196
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:32,760
volume taking the derivative of this

1197
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,400
with respect to

1198
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,200
p and you see that since this last term

1199
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:41,000
doesn't have pressure I just pick up

1200
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,440
something from uh uh the derivative of

1201
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,839
the chemical potential of the pure

1202
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,839
component and that's uh the specific

1203
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:57,760
volume so here we see that there is no

1204
01:07:51,640 --> 01:08:00,480
volume of mixing there is no ISO the

1205
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:06,119
Delta essentially we we proving that

1206
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:09,880
Delta V I mix for a Gibs Dalton mixture

1207
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:13,240
of Ideal gases and so on is equal to

1208
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:18,920
zero up here we prove that this is equal

1209
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:21,960
to Delta S I mix for a Gibs Dalton

1210
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:24,960
mixture of Ideal

1211
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,440
gases I should I should write it because

1212
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,440
otherwise

1213
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:45,440
okay the same for the

1214
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:49,159
enthalpy remember that derivative that I

1215
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:51,799
emphasized this morning uh earlier

1216
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:55,120
um if I take the expression for the

1217
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:58,920
chemical potential divided by T and take

1218
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:02,920
the with respect to T to one /

1219
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:05,319
T okay well if I divide this by T it

1220
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,880
becomes independent of temperature so

1221
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:08,600
when I take the derivative with respect

1222
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,799
to any function of temperature it

1223
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:14,560
doesn't contribute anything so that

1224
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,520
means that the uh enal the um the

1225
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,799
partial

1226
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:23,719
enthalpy is related just to uh the

1227
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:26,920
specific enpy of the

1228
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:28,520
gas which here Al so I remove the

1229
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,880
temperature the pressure dependence

1230
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:34,440
because for a for an ideal gas the

1231
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:39,080
enthalpy depends only on

1232
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:40,560
temperature and similarly for the uh so

1233
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,400
that also

1234
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,120
proves that also Delta

1235
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:48,560
H

1236
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,560
makes equal

1237
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:57,920
zero remember what that what this proper

1238
01:09:55,719 --> 01:10:00,120
are these are the things that I measure

1239
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:04,480
when I add a little bit of a substance

1240
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:10,560
to my mixture if I do it with an ideal

1241
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,560
mixture of Ideal gases uh those are

1242
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,920
zero we can also

1243
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:27,320
prove for a gas for this kind of mixture

1244
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:27,320
uh the so-called amagat low of additive

1245
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:38,000
volumes which can be interpreted this

1246
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,000
way U suppose I

1247
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:44,719
take

1248
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,719
my pure

1249
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,760
components that you remember from the

1250
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:54,360
when you we interpreted the the the the

1251
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,840
mix before if they are at the partial uh

1252
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,440
pressure

1253
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,760
they occupy the entire volume of the

1254
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:05,600
mixture but if I squeeze

1255
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,920
them from the partial pressure to the

1256
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,280
pressure of the

1257
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:12,320
mixture they are going to occupy a

1258
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,640
volume which is called the proper volume

1259
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,640
v

1260
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:21,320
Prime which see this is not so this is

1261
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,640
the the volume they occupy at the same

1262
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:27,120
temperature and pressure of the mixture

1263
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,120
when pure

1264
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:32,960
okay and I do the same for all of them

1265
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,800
so they're all squeezed at the same

1266
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,360
pressure of the mixture well it turns

1267
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:43,880
out that the sum of these volumes is

1268
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,880
equal to the volume of the

1269
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:55,440
mixture okay and that is amagat law of

1270
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,440
additive volumes

1271
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:11,080
okay

1272
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:14,280
so now let's uh apply for the for

1273
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:16,639
example for an an important

1274
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:20,800
example uh what we have what we have

1275
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:24,560
seen so we want to compute the so-called

1276
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,800
uh this bottom line here is the formula

1277
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:30,360
that we call the entropy uh of

1278
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:33,159
spontaneous uh

1279
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:35,560
mixing which is actually going to be an

1280
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:39,159
ISO thermobaric

1281
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:41,600
mix so the idea here is that we start

1282
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:41,600
with a

1283
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:48,040
container which is isolated so it

1284
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:50,679
doesn't experience any

1285
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:54,480
um uh there is no heat

1286
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:57,560
buff no uh thermal Reservoir no contact

1287
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:01,040
with thermal res reservo it's just

1288
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:03,679
isolated and I have my our

1289
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:05,560
constituents uh all in mutual

1290
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,520
equilibrium at the same temperature and

1291
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:10,280
pressure because these

1292
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:13,320
partitions uh that separate them are

1293
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:16,679
movable and therefore allow exchanges of

1294
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:18,600
volume and and energy so the conditions

1295
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:20,639
for Mutual equilibrium is equality of

1296
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,320
temperature and

1297
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:25,800
equality of

1298
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:30,080
pressure then

1299
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:31,600
I make those partitions those yeah

1300
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,600
moving

1301
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,600
partitions

1302
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,199
disappear as you

1303
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:47,719
know since we are within the simple

1304
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:51,000
system model taking the partition away

1305
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:54,920
doesn't doesn't

1306
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,199
change uh the properties of uh any of

1307
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:59,600
the

1308
01:13:56,199 --> 01:14:01,480
properties and the moment I do that

1309
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:05,360
removal the

1310
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,360
particles are still

1311
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,719
separated so the

1312
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:28,480
particles which start from here and my

1313
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,480
system is the system with the

1314
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:33,560
partitions when I remove the

1315
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,440
partitions the stable equilibrium

1316
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:41,560
State and the new there have a new

1317
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,840
system because I've changed the the

1318
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:46,360
internal

1319
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,360
structure it has a

1320
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:52,679
new curve for the stable equilibrium

1321
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,679
States

1322
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,280
and the moment I have

1323
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:06,560
removed the partitions and the

1324
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:09,600
properties hav changed this state here

1325
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,400
which is which was a stable equilibrium

1326
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,760
state with the partitions becomes a

1327
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,480
non-e equilibrium state with respect to

1328
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,120
the system without

1329
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:21,280
partitions and the system will tend to

1330
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:24,280
evolve

1331
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:27,760
spontaneously towards a new equilibrium

1332
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,760
which is going going to be the

1333
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:34,719
mixture the particles will mix and each

1334
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,719
one of

1335
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:42,080
them if you think in terms of the single

1336
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:46,440
particle contribution each particle

1337
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:50,360
here was squeezed to a small

1338
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:52,560
volume and now it sees the entire volume

1339
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:55,040
available so it

1340
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,080
expands and the same for the particles

1341
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,840
here and the same particles there so

1342
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:02,840
each one experiences a spontaneous

1343
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:06,920
expansion it's

1344
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:10,960
like if you take the single particle

1345
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:13,199
view say say particle one and here I

1346
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,199
have

1347
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,800
vacuum

1348
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,360
okay I remove the

1349
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,360
partition and the particle now fills the

1350
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,440
entire volume and fills the the the

1351
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,679
entire volume

1352
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,679
there's no more

1353
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:33,520
vacuum because at the beginning I had

1354
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:37,440
zero probability of finding my particles

1355
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:39,960
here and probability one of finding it

1356
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,560
there when I remove the partition the

1357
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,000
particle is still

1358
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:48,199
one uh but now I have an even

1359
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,199
probability of finding it

1360
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,920
everywhere

1361
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:56,840
okay so for the

1362
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,400
we want to

1363
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:07,840
describe uh that spontaneous

1364
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:10,000
process and so we want to analyze our uh

1365
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,719
process here we have a final State and

1366
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,560
an initial State and the tools are as

1367
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:17,360
usual the energy balance and the entropy

1368
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,480
balance plus the auxiliary balances that

1369
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,639
are

1370
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:26,760
uh balance for the volume balance for

1371
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:26,760
the amounts of the constituents

1372
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:33,280
so I need to write the various

1373
01:17:30,639 --> 01:17:36,480
ingredients of those balance equations

1374
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,920
which are the expressions for the energy

1375
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,000
the volume and the entropy in the

1376
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:43,719
initial

1377
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:47,040
State and in the final State I've called

1378
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:49,679
this final State B

1379
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:54,679
Prime uh and I call that final

1380
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:54,679
temperature T Prime and pressure p Prime

1381
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:03,639
for the initial state things are easy

1382
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:07,880
because the components are separate so

1383
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:09,800
these are this is just a

1384
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:12,920
composite uh

1385
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:15,400
of separate pure

1386
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,520
substances we know how to compute

1387
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:23,040
properties of pure substances and here

1388
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:26,480
in particular they are ideal gases even

1389
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:31,960
simpler and so we simply have to use

1390
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:31,960
additivity for energy for volume and for

1391
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:43,199
entropy and sum up the energy of each

1392
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:45,360
one of them since U is a specific energy

1393
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:48,520
the energy of this system is obtained by

1394
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:51,800
the specific energy times the amount and

1395
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:56,120
then I sum and that's the additivity and

1396
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,120
the same for volume the same for entropy

1397
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:03,040
in the

1398
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,040
final

1399
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:14,360
state in the final state things are not

1400
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,360
as simple because it's a

1401
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:20,920
mixture so we have to take a model for

1402
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:25,080
mixture Behavior so here we're going to

1403
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:28,800
adopt the Gibs Dalton uh ideal GBS Delon

1404
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,800
mixture model for this

1405
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:35,520
data

1406
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:40,840
therefore the energy for the mixture is

1407
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:43,440
equal to the the sum weighted by the

1408
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,480
amounts of

1409
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:49,199
the

1410
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:52,199
um specific properties of the pure

1411
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:55,480
components evaluated at the temperature

1412
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:56,960
and the partial pressure

1413
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,760
so here in principle I should have

1414
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:04,520
written comma

1415
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:07,480
pii but I didn't because I remember that

1416
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:10,480
uh for an ideal gas the energy is a

1417
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:12,840
function only of temperature so that

1418
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:15,080
dependence isn't

1419
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,639
there because if you

1420
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:21,280
remember

1421
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:24,840
du is equal to CV DT and for an ideal

1422
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:28,199
gas there is nothing no pressure

1423
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:30,199
dependence and here we're talking about

1424
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:32,520
something that holds for each of the

1425
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:32,520
pure

1426
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:46,040
substances

1427
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:50,400
then we can use uh the relation for the

1428
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:53,480
uh this is amagat's relation or uh you

1429
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:56,639
can use any in any case the equation of

1430
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,639
State uh

1431
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:00,960
and uh and we already proved that V is

1432
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,280
equal

1433
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:07,120
to that the the the mixture of Ideal

1434
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:10,800
gases under the Gibs Balton

1435
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:14,280
model behaves itself as an ideal gas so

1436
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,360
there is a the relation equation of

1437
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:19,880
State PV equals

1438
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,520
nrt for the entire mixture here and

1439
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:25,199
that's what we use

1440
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,960
here and then for the entropy

1441
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:29,280
the

1442
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:32,040
entropy is the sum of the entropies of

1443
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,639
the specific entropies evaluated at the

1444
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:39,679
uh paral

1445
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:43,239
pressures now the entropy does depend on

1446
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:47,600
pressure so I did

1447
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:51,120
leave uh the partial pressure that the

1448
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:53,600
components have in the final

1449
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:55,560
state so these are just the ingredient

1450
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,600
of the balance equation now I make the

1451
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:01,840
balance equation so the balance

1452
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:04,920
equation when the system is completely

1453
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:08,880
uh isolated is that the energy is

1454
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:10,880
conserved so U final minus U initial is

1455
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:14,199
equal to

1456
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:16,800
zero so I have U final I have U initial

1457
01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:21,679
I subtract

1458
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,679
them I can put this under the same

1459
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,719
summation then I remember this equation

1460
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,880
here and

1461
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:45,440
uh so for each of the constituents I can

1462
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:48,400
write that is that the integrate from uh

1463
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:50,520
from T to T Prime this

1464
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,679
difference uh so this is the integral

1465
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:56,440
from T to T Prime of CV and here there

1466
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:56,440
should be a CV I I

1467
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:04,280
okay okay so this integral has to be

1468
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,920
equal to

1469
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:10,520
zero now when when can that be equal to

1470
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,800
zero now here we we have to remember a

1471
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:18,080
few things that uh for

1472
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:18,080
each uh pure substance the specific

1473
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:24,840
Heats are non negative are greater than

1474
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,159
zero we proved it because they're

1475
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,880
related to the second derivative of the

1476
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:34,000
fundamental relations Is they're related

1477
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:34,000
to the to this concavity

1478
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:41,440
here so we have an

1479
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,719
integral of positive quantities of a

1480
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,679
positive

1481
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:47,440
function weighted and then multiplied by

1482
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,159
positive numbers because the amounts can

1483
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:52,040
only be positive of course cannot be

1484
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:54,480
have a negative

1485
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:57,199
amount so you can view this as an

1486
01:23:54,480 --> 01:24:02,120
integral of a

1487
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:05,560
function an integral from say X1 to

1488
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,560
X2 of a

1489
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:11,440
function that has to be equal to zero

1490
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,760
while this

1491
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,760
function is

1492
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:21,000
positive so here's a

1493
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:24,040
function positive and the

1494
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,800
integral is equal to this area now from

1495
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:29,320
X 1 to

1496
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,920
X2 so if the function is positive and I

1497
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:35,760
want the integral to be zero the only

1498
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,800
way is that the interval of integration

1499
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,119
must be

1500
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,520
zero so that

1501
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:45,360
implies that this integral is equal to

1502
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:48,040
zero only when X2 is equal to

1503
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:50,679
X1 so that

1504
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:54,840
proves that the final temperature must

1505
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:54,840
be equal to the initial temperature

1506
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:01,520
we have no need to making any

1507
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:04,199
assumptions of what these functions are

1508
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:06,719
whether they are functions of whether

1509
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:08,960
they are constant or not they can be

1510
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:12,800
functions arbitrary functions of

1511
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,800
temperature still get the same

1512
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:22,960
result then if I

1513
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:25,320
make the volume balance

1514
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,840
equation here's another mistake this is

1515
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,840
a v not a

1516
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:36,719
u um so the final volume since we are in

1517
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:39,760
the same overall box fin final volume is

1518
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:43,159
equal to initial volume so the these two

1519
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,000
are equal if I look at this uh relation

1520
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:47,960
here it says

1521
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,880
that if I put them equal it says that t

1522
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:53,280
over p is equal to T Prime over P

1523
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,400
Prime so that means that if we just

1524
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,880
prove that t Prime is equal to T so the

1525
01:25:55,400 --> 01:26:00,080
final temperature is equal to the

1526
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:02,480
initial the the volume balance implies

1527
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,639
that also the final pressure is equal to

1528
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,639
the

1529
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:15,880
initial so spontaneous mixing

1530
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:15,880
with these conditions is isotherm

1531
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:25,119
baric different story is for the entropy

1532
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:25,119
balance

1533
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:32,280
the entropy

1534
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,920
balance is written here with another

1535
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:37,840
little mistake because this should be a

1536
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:40,840
capital S so the final entropy minus the

1537
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,840
initial

1538
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:48,040
entropy there are no interaction so

1539
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,920
there is no entropy transfer yeah no

1540
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:52,199
heat

1541
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:56,080
interactions uh but there can be entropy

1542
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:56,080
produced by irreversibility

1543
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:10,000
so we rewrite this so s here is equal SB

1544
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:13,400
minus sa a and I have the terms

1545
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,400
here so I

1546
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:19,320
substitute now I realize that

1547
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:22,920
um this we can also

1548
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:25,320
write well actually it's this expression

1549
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:28,800
here I have

1550
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:32,320
to I don't have to re uh prove it it's

1551
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:35,920
written here this difference is equal to

1552
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:38,960
minus r log Y which is also is

1553
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,560
interpreted as the entropy of isomar

1554
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:45,360
baric

1555
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:48,400
mixing and therefore the if I take

1556
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:51,040
um R the minus sign outside of a

1557
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:54,400
summation I take also the total amount

1558
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:57,639
out of the summation then I'm left in

1559
01:27:54,400 --> 01:28:00,440
side with the mole fraction times the

1560
01:27:57,639 --> 01:28:00,440
log of the mole

1561
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:07,440
fraction now at first first site one

1562
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:16,520
would be worried about the minus sign

1563
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,520
because uh we know that the

1564
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:22,159
entropy produced by reversibility cannot

1565
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,679
be negative must be positive but if you

1566
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,960
look at this uh function

1567
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:28,119
y log

1568
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:32,239
y the

1569
01:28:28,119 --> 01:28:33,159
function in the interval between zero

1570
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:36,800
and

1571
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:39,440
one the function y y log y does

1572
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,440
something like

1573
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:47,080
that versus

1574
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:51,520
y so it's

1575
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:56,040
negative so minus y log Y is

1576
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:56,040
positive and we are safe that means for

1577
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:01,800
[Music]

1578
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,560
um reasonable in other words um possible

1579
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,880
values of the mole

1580
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:09,440
fractions which of course can go only

1581
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:11,440
between zero and one that function is

1582
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:15,560
non-

1583
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:19,239
negative but it also says that there

1584
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:23,199
is entropy production so the process is

1585
01:29:19,239 --> 01:29:24,719
irreversible as we have uh anticipated

1586
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:28,679
by looking at the

1587
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:28,679
energy versus entropy

1588
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,600
graphs and this is called the entropy of

1589
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,440
mixing

1590
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:54,679
now so if I look at that graph

1591
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,679
immediately I also realize

1592
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:00,360
that I have could that I could have done

1593
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,560
better in other words we could have done

1594
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:05,320
the mixing

1595
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:10,760
reversibly because if I If instead of

1596
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:10,760
going this way I go this

1597
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:22,560
way I do not generate enthropy and I

1598
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,560
extract some

1599
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,880
work so this this is what we called the

1600
01:30:25,159 --> 01:30:30,119
adiabatic availability of the state that

1601
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:32,239
is achieved the moment I remove the

1602
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:34,600
partition that non equilibrium State as

1603
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:37,639
adiabatic availability if I am quick

1604
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:39,000
enough or smart enough to do whatever

1605
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:42,400
needs to be

1606
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:47,719
done and we'll see how we could do it in

1607
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:47,719
a moment uh you we could extract some

1608
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:59,159
work so here is the

1609
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:59,159
calculation of that adiabatic

1610
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,800
availability so now the final

1611
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:12,800
State

1612
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:15,840
okay what we just uh U

1613
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:19,320
derived is that if you if we mix This

1614
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,960
Way the final state is the same

1615
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:24,920
temperature and

1616
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,679
pressure clearly if we we go down and we

1617
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:30,560
have extracted some

1618
01:31:26,679 --> 01:31:32,280
energy the final State here we have a

1619
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:36,679
smaller

1620
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,679
temperature which we call it touble

1621
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:48,440
Prime and how do we measure it how do we

1622
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:50,679
uh do the computation well we

1623
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:52,719
start the previous computation we

1624
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:55,199
started from the energy balance setting

1625
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:58,440
that final energy equal to initial

1626
01:31:55,199 --> 01:32:01,360
energy that determines the temperature

1627
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:03,560
now we start from the entropy balance

1628
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,280
because for a reversible process because

1629
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,320
we want to extract the adiabatic

1630
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:10,080
availability so that's a reversible

1631
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:13,119
weight process the entropy stays

1632
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:15,520
constant we apply equality of final

1633
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:18,920
initial entropy and so we start from the

1634
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,920
entropy balance

1635
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:38,639
uh yeah here is the entropy balance s

1636
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:38,639
final minus s initial equals

1637
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:45,920
z so we write

1638
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:45,920
it this way with the double

1639
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:52,719
primes and then this difference uh here

1640
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,040
we can

1641
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:04,880
uh yeah it's evaluated it's

1642
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,840
evaluated in this

1643
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:09,520
line

1644
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,880
because okay tble Prime is the final

1645
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:15,960
temperature that we

1646
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:17,639
have p double Prime double I is the

1647
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:20,119
partial pressure that the components

1648
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:23,560
will have in that new Final

1649
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:25,199
state so that partial pressure is going

1650
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,239
to be equal

1651
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:29,760
to the mole

1652
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:32,840
fraction so that partial pressure will

1653
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:37,480
be be equal to the mole fraction

1654
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:37,480
times the final pressure pble

1655
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:43,119
Prime

1656
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:43,119
but if we

1657
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:55,119
remember if we remember the equation of

1658
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:58,639
uh if we look at the volume balance

1659
01:33:55,119 --> 01:34:01,119
which is written here pble Prime over

1660
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:06,199
tble Prime is equal to P over

1661
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:09,719
T so I can uh think of pble

1662
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:16,480
prime pble

1663
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:20,000
prime as um what is it P over

1664
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:25,440
T at as P

1665
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,440
times T Prime over t

1666
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:34,960
okay and that's why I am writing

1667
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:38,119
this

1668
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:41,119
here then I

1669
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:45,119
apply the relation for

1670
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:47,080
um for how the entropy depends on on on

1671
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:49,639
temperature and

1672
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:52,760
pressure here we also have a temperature

1673
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:55,080
dependence so we also have the CP log

1674
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:58,239
contribution of the ratio of

1675
01:34:55,080 --> 01:35:01,080
temperatures minus r the log of the

1676
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:01,080
ratio of the

1677
01:35:01,719 --> 01:35:07,199
pressures

1678
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:09,080
okay then I I can split this logarithm

1679
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:11,840
as being this logarithm of the product

1680
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:15,920
is going to be the sum of the logarithms

1681
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:18,760
so I take the minus r log y here and

1682
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:21,639
then I combine the log of tble prime

1683
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:25,760
that appears from this part and with

1684
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:30,440
that part it gets multiplied by CV minus

1685
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,440
r but by the my relation that's C

1686
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:41,679
CV okay so we finally have this

1687
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:41,679
expression we can put it in the entropy

1688
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:51,920
balance now I see here that I could

1689
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,920
Define

1690
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:59,320
a an average aage

1691
01:35:56,159 --> 01:36:04,800
specific heat at constant

1692
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:07,920
volume of the mixture as being the

1693
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:11,760
weighted uh as being the sum this

1694
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:14,199
summation here

1695
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:18,239
okay and then I

1696
01:36:14,199 --> 01:36:20,159
recognize this final term which is um

1697
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:23,800
very close I mean what is exactly what

1698
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:26,520
we call the entropy of mixing

1699
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:29,320
well in any case by setting since this

1700
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,880
has to be equal to zero by the entropy

1701
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:37,440
balance this gives me an an expression

1702
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:37,440
way to calculate dble Prime the final

1703
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:41,560
temperature and this is the

1704
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:49,800
result now the fact that these functions

1705
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:54,119
are negative so e to a negative number

1706
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:56,840
is is less than one

1707
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:59,280
shows that of course as we

1708
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:02,400
expected the final temperature will be

1709
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,400
less than the initial

1710
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:08,920
temperature and now that we have the

1711
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:11,199
final temperature we can perform the

1712
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:13,040
energy balance now the energy balance

1713
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:15,119
here since the system is not any

1714
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:17,000
isolated anymore because we have lifted

1715
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:20,639
the weight in the weight

1716
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:24,080
process we have extracted the thetic

1717
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:25,880
availability so uh the

1718
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,639
the energy given to the weight is equal

1719
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:31,800
to the difference between the initial

1720
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:31,800
and the final uh

1721
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:38,239
energy so by substituting these

1722
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,480
ingredients that we calculated up there

1723
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:40,480
and

1724
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:45,560
using uh the same the specific heat as

1725
01:37:43,639 --> 01:37:49,760
constant volume then the fact that the

1726
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:54,000
ammation we defined as sort of an

1727
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:58,719
average uh mixing uh

1728
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,719
mixture uh specific heat constant

1729
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:04,320
volume and we substitute tble Prime and

1730
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,440
you compute the value for the adiabatic

1731
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,360
availability so we

1732
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:12,840
see that

1733
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:12,840
this represents this

1734
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:20,520
work

1735
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:22,119
just to show you how we we could

1736
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:25,440
actually do it with a picture so we

1737
01:38:22,119 --> 01:38:25,440
conclude we have 1 minute

1738
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:33,239
how can you do that can we actually

1739
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:33,239
separate the mixture

1740
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:38,480
uh

1741
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:41,840
remember

1742
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:44,239
this problem here with the single

1743
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,639
particle if I have a single particle

1744
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:49,400
there and I have

1745
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:53,119
vacuum I and I have this and instead of

1746
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:55,440
removing the Piston I can just have it

1747
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:55,440
uh

1748
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:03,800
uh move uh

1749
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,880
rightward while connected through a

1750
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:09,960
pulet to a weight and the pressure of

1751
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,679
the particle will push it to the right

1752
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:14,960
that that therefore the particul do work

1753
01:39:12,679 --> 01:39:14,960
and

1754
01:39:15,599 --> 01:39:21,239
lift and similarly if I have this other

1755
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:23,480
particle on the other different particle

1756
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:25,840
on the other side

1757
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:27,920
say suppose I have a particle of

1758
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:31,480
different

1759
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:35,239
kind that is confined that's separated

1760
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:38,400
and it's on the other side also

1761
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:41,040
here I can do the same and have the

1762
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:43,320
pressure of the particle or the

1763
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:47,159
particles doesn't really matter because

1764
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:49,440
each one acts by itself uh so that pulls

1765
01:39:47,159 --> 01:39:51,960
is this

1766
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:53,960
way and when the when we you have the

1767
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,800
presence of both parts particles you

1768
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,520
have to do it more carefully instead of

1769
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:00,719
having

1770
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:02,159
like an imperal P piston you have to use

1771
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:05,679
semi- perable

1772
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:07,599
membranes so that when this one moves to

1773
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:11,400
the

1774
01:40:07,599 --> 01:40:14,960
right it will uh

1775
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:18,400
uh so this one is

1776
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:22,440
allows uh the the the black particles to

1777
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:25,360
freely move in and out uh and then it

1778
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:27,760
fills on on only the pressure of the

1779
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:31,480
gray particles until you move to the

1780
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:35,520
right and this other membrane instead

1781
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:38,159
is allows the gray particles through and

1782
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:41,719
instead feels the pressure of the black

1783
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:45,040
particles okay so when you're done and

1784
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:47,960
if you done it uh reversibly you have

1785
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:50,840
extracted this adiabatic

1786
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:54,440
availability okay so I think we have to

1787
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:54,440
stop here today
