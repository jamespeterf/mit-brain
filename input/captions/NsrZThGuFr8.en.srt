1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,759
okay I only have five minutes but I

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,359
first want to very sincerely thank the

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,520
organizers and to the audience this is

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,920
the best meeting of the year and I

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
really just love being here and the

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,840
engagement from everyone so thank you

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,240
for that my name is Brian Chamberlain

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,720
I'm a medicinal chemist at tanmai we are

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,320
a drug Discovery Services Company a cro

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,359
that is dedicated to addressing

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,480
bottlenecks and Drug Discovery by

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,039
combining a state-of-the-art wet lab

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,640
with Advanced computational Techniques

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,279
be they physics based or AI we get very

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,720
excited when we can combine physic space

16
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,840
and AI approaches to accelerate and

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,000
overcome these

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,360
bottlenecks last year I showed a poster

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,239
in which we showed our implementation of

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,760
using Active Learning and rbfe to

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,320
optimize our groups very efficiently we

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
and others in the field are doing this

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,360
and if you're not doing this you're

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,039
missing out on opportunity to be very

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,559
efficient and comprehensive in driving

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,719
the potency of your R groups in that

27
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,440
case you're able to enumerate large

28
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,000
libraries of reasonable compounds using

29
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,359
reaction-based um framework very simple

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
you know your Chemistry you have a

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,960
building block a building block library

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,479
of hundreds of thousands of compounds

33
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,600
and you know you're going to be able to

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,680
to execute on those

35
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,439
synthetically predicting the potency of

36
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,119
those compounds is also amenable to the

37
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:18,560
current methods you're able to tweak the

38
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,920
state-of-the-art for predicting potency

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,799
rbfe in certain ways to make it even

40
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,159
more computationally efficient and then

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,680
you're able to drive that in an active

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,759
learning cycle again the synthesis is

43
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,479
already baked into how you have set up

44
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,360
that experiment and you're able to

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,320
execute on those very easily often times

46
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,840
in a plate based

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,799
format core hopping is an essential

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,280
activity in drug Discovery I don't think

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,840
I've worked on a single program in my

50
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,840
career where we haven't tried to do a

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,000
core hop whether to address a known

52
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,640
liability protect against an unknown

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,399
liability protect RP or quite frankly

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,479
fast follow on someone else's IP here

55
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,280
all of

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,200
the here the challenges to this vers our

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,880
group enumeration are that it's very

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,799
difficult to enumer at large reasonable

59
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,680
libraries of cor Hops and then

60
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,920
calculating the potency of those is is

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,000
quite challenging um rbfe needs

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,239
congeneric molecules with small changes

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
to be effective so probably the most

64
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,480
important scientific advance in my

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,360
poster is our implementation of Fe which

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,480
we call

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,840
CBF I won't get into the details now um

68
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,959
but it allows you to calculate the

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,959
potency of compounds in a relativistic

70
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,599
framework um purely arbitrary changes um

71
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,000
so these compounds you would not be able

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,599
to calculate using rbfe this is a brd4

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,159
data set and we show very nice

74
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:45,080
correlation here unlike an abfe

75
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,080
simulation you never have to sample the

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,480
apostate we apply this method in a Soup

77
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,879
To Nuts um prospective case study on SAU

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,560
one inhibitor mrtx 0902 and for me as a

79
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,080
medicinal chemist the most interesting

80
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,599
aspect of this work is the enumeration

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,200
We compare multiple enumeration methods

82
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,640
sort of the most common ones in the

83
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,720
field um link invent both the prior

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,560
model and reinforcement learning on

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,760
basic objective endpoints creme and

86
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,360
recore um we did a lot of work to get

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,840
those libraries for those methods if

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,120
you're aware of them to work on a corop

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,040
and give us meaningful number of

90
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,799
compounds and we compare and contrast

91
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,480
those um we also have a human medicinal

92
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,680
chemist designed the compounds as a

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,959
human medicinal chemist would by looking

94
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,720
at the crystal structure and thinking

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,640
about what type YP of reactions

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,840
are expected to perform

97
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,560
well a lot I can say about the

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,040
enumeration of all those different

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,519
modules but the two things I'd like to

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,519
highlight is that generative AI is the

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,799
most important computational approach to

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,439
generating cor hop libraries simply

103
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,280
because of its ability to generate very

104
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,319
large libraries which you will not be

105
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,079
able to access with Library based

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,879
methods very interestingly to me if you

107
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,920
compare um the compounds enumerated from

108
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,879
the generative AI approach and look for

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,000
the human design compound you can't find

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,400
it um even if you were to run link inv

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
vent with reinforcement learning onto a

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,680
very narrow molecular weight around

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,400
which the molecular we're looking for

114
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,239
you would have to enumerate maybe a 100

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,799
million compounds to maybe enumerate the

116
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,479
compound that a medicinal chemist came

117
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,479
up with so I think that's really

118
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,040
important um we have to combine and take

119
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,800
the best features of all of these

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,360
different enumeration techniques to

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,680
achieve our goal

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,160
we then dock all these compounds using a

123
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,720
few algorithms to make sure whatever

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,039
we're observing is not just strictly

125
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,280
related to Vena or R do or whatever and

126
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,240
I have trends that I can show you um

127
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,560
probably the most interesting one uh for

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,120
the next 15 seconds is that the library

129
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,600
based methods are really really perform

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,600
well at reproducing the rmsd POS of the

131
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,919
reference Li and that's super important

132
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,800
to being able to deploy the physics

133
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,039
based methods so I take it all the way

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,240
um we run the CBF I have the real data

135
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,560
on how that performed um so you can

136
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,120
assess for yourself if you think it's

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
interesting or if you would want to use

138
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,520
that tool and then I show the actual

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,280
ic50s uh I don't have time now but I can

140
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,360
kind of philosophize um how these

141
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,360
techniques are impacting me as a

142
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,360
medicinal chemist of course none of this

143
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,400
really was existed or if it existed it

144
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,080
wasn't easy to use or someone like

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,639
someone like me to access and and deploy

146
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,800
um without really a lot of special

147
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:37,240
computational help

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,240
so 5 minutes exactly thank you
